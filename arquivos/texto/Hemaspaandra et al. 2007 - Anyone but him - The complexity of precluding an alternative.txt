We claim S contains exact cover B w unique approval winner partition voters model TE For left right direction S contains exact cover B let V2 consist k voters corresponding sets cover n k voters approve x 1 cid2 cid2 n voter approves y zi Let V1 V V2 Then w unique approval winner C V1 x y tied ﬁrst place C V2 n k Yes votes Since model TE candidates nominated C V2 w wins runoff election default For right left direction suppose w unique approval winner partition voters model TE Since model TE w unique winner subelections Let V1 V2 partition V w unique winner C V1 As proof Theorem 444 follows voters corresponding Si s V1 V2 correspond cover Suppose k voters correspond Si s V2 Note 1 cid2 cid2 n voter approves y zi V2 werent zi Yes votes V1 w It follows y n k Yes votes V2 But y unique approval winner V2 candidate n k Yes votes V Since y beats w runoff contradicts fact w wins election It follows k voters corresponding Si s V2 Thus exactly k voters voters correspond exact
