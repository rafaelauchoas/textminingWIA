INTRODUCTION Uncorrected refractive error lead variety broader issues It estimated WHO uncorrected refractive error results global loss hundreds billions US dollars year reduced productivity1 In addition loss visual function2 refractive error associ ated reduced educational performance children3 As 2004 64 million children aged 515 years living China affected refractive error accounts 50 cases refractive error world4 Key messages What known subject A majority studies identified correlations tween eyeglasses wear uncorrected refractive error identified causal link especially middle school students northwestern rural China What new findings The current study provides strong evidence safety eyeglasses wear middle school stu dents uncorrected refractive error northwest ern rural China How results change focus research clinical practice The imperfect compliance eyeglasses wear means results underestimate true effect eyeglasses wear refractive power focus future research Refractive error effectively inex pensively treated eyeglasses However middle school students rural China 30 students needing eyeglasses wear them5 Studies China suggest factors leading poor
