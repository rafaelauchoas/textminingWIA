TRACK AESTHETIC Abdominal Plication Postoperative Venous Thromboembolic Events Following Abdominal Body Contouring A Propensity Score Matching Analysis Presenter Fei Wang BA CoAuthors Katherine Chemakin BS Peter Shamamian Jr BS Isha Punn BS Tessa Campbell MD Joseph A Ricci MD Affiliation Montefiore Medical Center The Bronx NY PURPOSE Venous thromboembolic events VTE deep venous thrombosis DVT pulmonary embolism PE rare potentially devastating complications abdominal body contouring procedures With incidence 1 VTE rate surgeries significantly lower surgical specialties remain significant cause morbidity mortality1 2 Rectus abdominis plication commonly utilized method reduce diastasis width associated increased intra abdominal pressure35 Though concerns increased intraabdominal pressure lead increased DVTs subsequent PEs exist lack literature investigat ing associations abdominal contouring procedures aim bridge gap knowledge METHOD A retrospective review conducted patients underwent abdominal body contouring proce dures Montefiore Medical Center 2010 2020 Cases defined patients experienced postop erative venous thromboembolic event matched controls 14 ratio propensity score matching technique Patient factors note included demographic data operative details ASA Charlson comorbidity index Caprini scores Postoperative complications col lected patients Parametric nonparametric mul tivariable regression modeling utilized analysis RESULTS A total 1192 patients underwent abdominal contouring procedures 19 159 experienced postop erative venous thromboembolic event matched 76 controls The overall cohort 926 female n88 average age Charlson comorbidity index BMI operative time 4499 year 138 point 3025 units 28469 minutes respectively Mean BMI differed 66 significantly cases controls 321 vs 298 p0046 cases likely prior history cerebrovascular events OR 345 p0026 Addition ally patients postoperative VTEs likely received intraoperative blood
