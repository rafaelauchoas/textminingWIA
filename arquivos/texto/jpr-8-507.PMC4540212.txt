Hypervigilance pain automatic prioritization painrelated compared stimuli The processing threat information influenced negative contexts Therefore intended explore context effects hypervigilance paincues taking individual differences selfreported vigilance pain consideration Methods In 110 healthy subjects viewed taskirrelevant emotional facial expressions anger happy neutral pain overlaid half trials fine grid The instructed task indicate presenceabsence grid A threatening context established applying electrical stimuli slightly painthreshold Using scores Pain Vigilance Awareness Questionnaire sample divided high vs low pain vigilant subjects Reaction times eventrelated brain potentials recorded Results No distinct attentional processing pain faces based eventrelated brain potentials observed function high levels selfreported vigilance pain contextual threat induction High pain vigilant subjects showed generally enhanced processing emotional neutral faces indicated parameters early early posterior negativity late late positive complex processing stages This enhancement abolished electrostimuli presented Conclusion Contextual threat enhance attentional capture paincues presented concurrently competing task demands The study replicate generally enhanced attentional processing emotional cues high pain vigilant subjects This underpins hypervigilance pain

painrelated emotional cues deliberately task irrelevant We understanding hypervigilance Painrelated cues salient capture attention vigilant subjects despite irrelevance task solution From previous study knew primary task detection overlaid grid strong competitor processing taskirrelevant pain faces16 Similarly gridno grid differentiation strong impact reaction times ERP components present study Therefore salience pain faces emotional faces small counteract taskrelevant stimuli leading major role face stimuli attentional processing Using blackandwhite snapshot pictures facial expressions pain

experimental control In sense argue high attentional load primary task prevented effects facial expression emotions limited emotional salience facial expressions One assumed successful induction threat use aversive electrical stimulation changed focus attentional processing Especially threat condition intermittent electrical stimulation clearly effective producing sympathetic arousal However condition pain faces gain salience distinct impacts ERP parameters considered This means attentional capture emotional stimuli pain faces finetuned balance established salience stimuli competing
