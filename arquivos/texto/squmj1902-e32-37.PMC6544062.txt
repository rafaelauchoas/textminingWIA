awareness importance involvement research activities student research units changes occurred SCFHS criteria admission postgraduate programmes It worth noting research involve ment 2015 2017 graduates higher studies Sweden Brazil1314 However studies conducted medical students study conducted medical graduates time involved research In current study confidence graduates start projects supervision increased significantly 2017 possibly graduates increased involvement researchpromoting activities P 0001 Past research noted students active participation research improve confidence understanding research addition incr easing pursuing researchbased careers postgraduate period15 However graduates expr essed concerns having sufficient research opportunities university This finding indicate barriers present students alternative solutions increasing research involve ment eliciting support supervisors different universities attending summer schools focused workshops provided research opportunities This observed high level confidence incr eased research practice result reporting Clinical Basic Research e35 Ahmed M Basakran Maysaa A Banjari Malak A Almarghoub Elaf M Alzarnougi bias

involvement 2015 2017 graduates similar findings studies conducted King Abdulaziz University Univ ersity College Cork Universiti Sains Malaysia1617 Furthermore peer pressure carry research significantly increased 2017 cohort comparing 2015 cohort P 0001 This increase attributed increasing competition graduates stringent research recommend ations implemented SCFHS 2017 Graduates identified barriers affecting research participation Both 2015 2017 graduates agreed lack time negatively impacted research practice 734 663 Similar obstacles research reported medical students Saudi Arabian study conducted medical schools18 These findings concur study United Kingdom 74 sample reporting time constraints acted crippling barrier research activities19 The persistence obstacle indicates importance allocating time dedicated specifically research The majority 60 2017 graduates believed shortage number available research projects indicating need enthusiastic faculty members summer schools provide research opportunities interested students It worth noting starting 2021 authoring research project prerequisite graduation King Abdulaziz University This positive change play important role improving students future participation research The current study noted improvement knowl edge existence research methodology training possibly free workshops cond ucted students research unit This positive change indicates plans improve students research practice succeeding efforts needed ensure adequacy given lectures workshops This obstacle represents barrier students research practice reported similar studies cond ucted Saudi Arabia Pakistan912 The primary limitation study data collected graduates data collection tool oneonone interviews Qualitative interviewbased studies help researchers better understand graduates perceptions research solutions increase research involvement Add itionally conducting study larger sample including graduates students universities different academic years insight improve students graduates practices perceptions research Conclusion This study highlighted positive changes attitudes perceptions research graduates medical programme
