antibodies confirmed radioimmunoassays However assays performed research purposes diffi cult isolate antibodies currently standardized method available78 One limitation report fact skin prick test serum analysis performed Be cause IgEmediated reaction excluded skin prick test serum analysis patient diagnosed anaphylaxis To accurate diagnosis additional testing methods skin prick test intradermal test oral provocation test utilized9 The oral provocation test currently accurate method Although exact mechanism elucidated studies suggest release mediators histamine result high penetrability fluoroquinolone cells plays important role devel opment anaphylaxis10 Thus suggested skin prick intradermal tests frequently produce falsepositive results fluoroquinolone directly trigger release histamine11 During anaphylactic reaction activated mast cells ba sophils secrete histamine tryptase The finding increased serum tryptase levels patients suspected having ana phylactic reaction useful12 Histamine levels peak 5 minutes return normal 1530 minutes How tryptase levels peak 15120 minutes onset anaphylaxis remain elevated 6 hours Therefore values provide valuable diagnostic information suspect ed cases anaphylaxis1314 In present case tryptase lev el elevated 2 hours point patients blood pressure decreased Previous studies shown correlation drug al lergies
