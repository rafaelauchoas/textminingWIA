referral hospital The development preparation needs account rectal pH infants affect drug partitioning absorption Rectal pH measurements taken 100 45 unwell infants We measured rectal pH 14 infants sequentially course illness The mean rectal pH 675 significant difference unwell infants The mean 95 CI rectal pH neonates significantly lower older infants 28 days 647 629665 vs 690 668 712 p ¼ 0003 Background Each year 10 million children 5 years age die majority infectious diseases 1 2 Many deaths prevented appropriate treatment broad spectrum antibiotic administered early course illness Children developing world risk poor healthcare systems distance facilities able provide medical care 3 Many infants particular neonates die home medical care given Communitybased health care workers shown effective teaching mothers recognize unwell infants need treatment 4 However availability technical expertise initiate treatment parental anti biotics impossible introduce maintain village level A large multicentre study looking prereferral malaria treatment showed rectal Acknowledgements The authors like extend thanks staff working SMRU clinic Maela particular head laboratory Chit Moh Moh
