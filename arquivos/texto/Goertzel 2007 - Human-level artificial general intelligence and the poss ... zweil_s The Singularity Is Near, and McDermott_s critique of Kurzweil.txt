The Singularity Is Near While McDermotts critique contain cogent points miss key points Kurzweils book tries It worthwhile brieﬂy pause consider McDermotts counterarguments strengths shortcomings One

humanlevel AGI hes saying plausible routeand route argue extrapolating historical growth curves nonAI technologies My view Kurzweil essentially correct extrapolations brainscanning computerhardware
