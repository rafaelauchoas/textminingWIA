square E Fig 3 shows conﬂict situations The says sources largely consis tent avoid called conﬂict says sources provide highly contradictory information said conﬂict Another interesting point Deﬁnition 10 need threshold measures need different thresholds Indeed different thresholds chosen indicates measure requires smaller threshold plays important role measure For instance threshold difBetP 10 cf m1 m2 reduced situation m essential Likewise threshold m 10 cf m1 m2 reduced situation difBetP useful As demonstrated examples earlier measures capable deﬁning conﬂict accurately Therefore thresholds
