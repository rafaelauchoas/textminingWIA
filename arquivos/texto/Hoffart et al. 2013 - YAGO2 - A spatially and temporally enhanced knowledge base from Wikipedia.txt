Wikipedia Each article Wikipedia entity knowledge base Leonard Cohen article Wikipedia LeonardCohen entity YAGO Certain categories Wikipedia exploited deliver type informa tion article Leonard Cohen category Canadian poets Canadian poet YAGO links type information taxonomy WordNet 2 Canadian poet subclass Word Net synset poet This linkage allowed YAGO create strong taxonomy key applications knowledge base consistency checks YAGO perform data The linkage algorithm use YAGO2 proceeds follows For category page determines head word category shallow noun phrase parsing In example Canadian poets head word poets It checks head word plural If proposes category class article entity instance This process effectively distinguishes thematic categories Canadian poetry conceptual ones simple observation countable nouns appear plural form countable nouns ontological classes The class linked WordNet taxonomy choosing frequent sense head word WordNet This simple disambiguation strategy proved surprisingly accurate In addition YAGO contains list handful manually compiled exceptions These head words conceptual appear plural stubs Canadian poetry stubs A second list exceptions contains words map frequent sense different sense The word capital refers main city country majority cases ﬁnancial frequent sense WordNet We slightly extended lists time provide new evaluation results paper YAGO 100 manually deﬁned relations wasBornOnDate locatedIn hasPopulation Cate gories infoboxes exploited deliver instances relations These instances called facts triples entity relation entity For purpose YAGO manually deﬁned patterns map categories fobox attributes fact templates Leonard Cohen infobox attribute bornMontreal gives fact wasBornInLeonardCohen Montreal This resulted 2 million extracted entities 20 million facts On extractions YAGO algorithms performed extensive consistency checks eliminating facts conform type functionality constraints A manual evaluation conﬁrmed overall precision YAGO 95 The key high precision large set facts manually deﬁned relations gave facts welldeﬁned semantics enabled YAGO selfcheck consistency YAGO represents facts triples subject S predicate P object O compatibility RDF data model YAGO makes extensive use reiﬁcation fact SPO triple given identiﬁer identiﬁer subject object facts For example fact id 42 extracted Wikipedia YAGO contain fact wasFoundIn42 Wikipedia This fact id Unlike RDF YAGO reify facts knowledge base Thereby YAGO avoids problems undecidability The consistency YAGO knowledge base decided polynomial time 9 During young life YAGO applications contributes numerous knowledge base endeavors DBpedia SUMO The present paper embarks YAGO level temporally spatially enhanced ontology 3 Extensible extraction architecture In ﬁrst version YAGO extraction hardwired rules source code As design allow easy extension completely reengineered code The new YAGO2 architecture based declarative rules stored text ﬁles This reduces hardwired extraction code method interprets rules The rules form subjectpredicateobject triples basically additional YAGO2 facts There different types rules Factual rules simply additional facts YAGO2 knowledge base They declarative translations man ually deﬁned exceptions facts previous YAGO code contained These include deﬁnitions relations domains ranges deﬁnition classes YAGO2 hierarchy literal types yagoInteger Each literal type comes regular expression check string lexical space type The factual rules add 3 new classes taxonomy yagoLegalActor combines legal ac tors organizations people yagoLegalActorGeo union yagoLegalActor geopolitical entities yagoGeoEntity groups geographical locations mountains cities The factual rules extend list exceptions linking Wikipedia categories WordNet synsets explained Section 2 The list category J Hoffart et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 194 2013 2861 31 head words mapped primary sense WordNet grew 60 For example word capital primary meaning WordNet ﬁnancial categories use word sense city Such factual rule represented simple YAGO fact capital hasPreferredMeaning wordnet_capital_108518505 Implication rules certain facts appear knowledge base fact shall added Thus im plication rules serve deduce new knowledge existing knowledge An implication rule expressed YAGO fact triple The subject fact states premise implication object fact holds conclusion Both subject object strings contain fact templates Whenever YAGO2 extractor detects match facts templates subject generates fact corresponds object adds knowledge base Thus implication rules expressive power domainrestricted Horn rules For example implication rules states relation subproperty relation instances ﬁrst relation instances second relation Implication rules use relation implies strings arguments 1 2 3 2 subpropertyOf 4 implies 1 4 3 Replacement rules source text matches speciﬁed regular expression certain string replace This takes care interpreting microformats cleaning HTML tags normalizing numbers It takes care eliminating administrative Wikipedia categories Articles cleaned articles want process articles entitled Comparison simply replacing material string Replacement rules use replace strings arguments USA replace United States Extraction rules source text matches speciﬁed regular expression sequence facts shall generated These rules apply primarily patterns Wikipedia infoboxes Wikipedia categories article titles regular elements source headings links references The regular expression Syntax javautilregex contains capturing groups single parts contain entities The capturing groups templates generate facts The templates deﬁne syntactic type entity Wikipedia Link Class YAGO literal types This allows extractor seek check entities captured group making sure syntactically wrong information extracted Category births pattern 0 wasBornOnDate Date1 This architecture extraction rules highly versatile easily extensible It allows accommodating new infoboxes new exceptions new fact types new preprocessing simply modifying text ﬁles rules In current implementation extraction rules cover 200 infobox patterns 90 category patterns dozen patterns dealing disambiguation pages Our patterns map 100 relations They aim cover 200 frequent infobox attributes Wikipedia They exclude infobox attributes inconsistently Wikipedia One example attribute history contains date information text descriptions They exclude attributes contain natural language text contain entities Wikipedia YAGO type check facts 4 Giving YAGO temporal dimension The metaphysical characteristics time existence subject intense philosophical debate inception philosophy For YAGO2 choose pragmatic approach time derive temporal properties objects data knowledge base YAGO2 contains data type yagoDate denotes time points typically resolution days cruder resolution like years Dates denoted standard format YYYYMMDD ISO 8601 If year known write dates form YYYY wildcard symbol In YAGO2 facts hold time points time spans represented relations form time interval wasBornOnDate diedOnDate We consider temporal information entities facts Entities assigned time span denote existence time For example Elvis Presley associated 1935 0108 birthdate 19770816 time death Bob Dylan alive associated time birth 19410524 The relevant relations discussed Section 41 Facts assigned time point instantaneous events time span extended duration known begin end For example fact BobDylan created BlondeOnBlonde associated time point 19660516 release date album The fact BobDylan isMarriedTo SaraLowndes associated time span 1965 1977 The time facts discussed Section 42 32 J Hoffart et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 194 2013 2861 Thus YAGO2 assigns begin andor end time spans entities facts events known start point known end point If time points inferred knowledge base attempt assignment Thereby YAGO2 chooses conservative approach leaving timedependent entities time scope assigning illdeﬁned time 41 Entities time Many entities come existence certain point time cease exist point time People example born die Countries created dissolved Buildings built possibly destroyed We capture notion entitys existence time span creation destruction entity Some entities come existence cease exist This applies abstract creations pieces music scientiﬁc theories literature works These entities existed prior inception cease exist Thus unbounded end point existence time Other entities deﬁned begin end lack information points knowledge base Examples numbers mythological ﬁgures virus strains information existence different discovery In cases YAGO2 assign existence time Instead manually considering entity type time spans sense focused following major entity types People relations wasBornOnDate diedOnDate demarcate existence times Groups music bands football clubs universities companies relations wasCreatedOnDate wasDestroyedOnDate demarcate existence times Artifacts buildings paintings books music songs albums relations wasCreatedOnDate Events DestroyedOnDate buildings sculptures demarcate existence times wars sports competitions like Olympics world championship tournaments named epochs like German autumn relations startedOnDate endedOnDate demarcate existence times This includes events day fall Berlin wall Here start date end date event coincide We use relation happenedOnDate cases We believe types cover cases entities meaningful existence time Note entities captured richly populated types YAGO2 covering thirds entities including GeoNames locations Rather dealing types separate manner unify cases introducing generic entitytime relations startsExistingOnDate endsExistingOnDate Both instance gen eral yagoRelation hold entity instance yagoDate They deﬁne temporal start point end point entity respectively We specify certain relations subproperties generic ones wasBornOnDate subpropertyOf startsExistingOnDate diedOnDate subpropertyOf endsExistingOn Date wasCreatedOnDate subpropertyOf startsExistingOnDate For events day specify happenedOnDate subproperty startsExistingOnDate endsExistingOnDate Declaring relations subpropertyOf relations serves hand grouping hand use YAGO2 implication rule infrastructure automatically deduce second fact parent relation For example fact BobDylan wasBornOnDate 19410524 implication rule creates second fact BobDylan startsExistin gOnDate 19410524 The YAGO2 extractors obtain lot temporal information entities Wikipedia infoboxes Our extractors ﬁnd temporal information categories For example article 82nd Academy Awards Ceremony category 2009 Film Awards gives temporal dimension award year 2009 Our infrastructure generates existence times entities YAGO deduce information data 42 Facts time 421 Facts extracted time Facts temporal dimension For example BobDylan wasBornIn Duluth event happened 1941 The fact BarackObama holdsPoliticalPosition PresidentOfTheUnitedStates denotes epoch time Obama elected president elected Obama resigns When extract time infor mation kinds facts Wikipedia associate occurrence time time span fact occurred To capture knowledge introduce new relations occursSince occursUntil reiﬁed fact instance yagoDate arguments For example fact fact id 1 indicate time 1 occursSince 20090120 For facts day year relevant granularity awards use shorthand notation automatically deduced relation occursOnDate For example BarackObama wasInauguratedAs J Hoffart et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 194 2013 2861 33 PresidentOfTheUnitedStates fact id 2 write 2 occursOnDate 20090120 shorthand separate facts 2 occursSince 20090120 2 occursUntil 20090120 If fact occurs YAGO2 contain multiple times different ids For example Bob Dylan won Grammy awards 1 BobDylan hasWonPrize GrammyAward 1 oc cursOnDate 1973 second 2 BobDylan hasWonPrize GrammyAward different id associated fact 2 occursOnDate 1979 The YAGO2 extractors ﬁnd occurrence times facts Wikipedia infoboxes For example awards mentioned year awarded Spouses mentioned date marriage divorce Our extractors detect annotations attach corresponding occursSince occursUntil facts directly target fact 422 Facts deduced time In cases entities appear fact indicate occurrence time fact For example BobDylan wasBornIn Duluth natural use Dylans birth date facts occurrence time For ElvisPresley diedIn Memphis want death date subject occurrence time BobDylan created BlondeOnBlonde creation time object The principle handling situations use rules propagate begin end entitys existence time occurrence time fact entity occurs subject object To avoid large number rules speciﬁc situations categorize relations major cases Each ontological interpretation handled straightforward propagation rule More precisely

Therefore introduce class subjectStartRelation groups relations indicate creation new entity subject position Some relations indicate creation entity ob ject position For example relation created

Unless relation explicitly types use propagation kind For example attempt propagate entity existence times fact occurrence times relations subclassOf hasDomain Even relations hasWonPrize isCapitalOf

2010 ran extractor fact 43 extractedOn 20110615 Each fact adorned metainformation This information independent semantic aspects fact captures provenance Still metafacts useful allow reasoners include exclude facts certain sources certain points time 5 Giving YAGO spatial dimension All physical objects location space For YAGO2 concerned entities permanent spa tial extent Earth example countries

Wikipedia Wikipedia contains large number cities regions mountains rivers lakes Many come associated geographical coordinates We harvest extraction framework retrieve coordinates 191 200 geoentities However geoentities Wikipedia annotated geographical coordinates Furthermore geoentities known Wikipedia Therefore tap richer source freely available geographical data GeoNames httpwwwgeonamesorg

Europe GeoNames provides alternate names location neighboring countries All data valuable addition YAGO effort integrate completely possible This means need match individual geoentities exist Wikipedia GeoNames duplicate theses entities extracting respective repositories 511 Matching locations When processing Wikipedia articles try match individual geoentities proceeding follows 1 If

theme temporal knowledge old AI topic 71 The standard textbook Russel Norvig 72 refers temporal facts ﬂuents instances relations validity function time There different approaches translate notion ﬂuents Semantic Web world The earliest approach W3C favor event entities For example birth person represented event entity birth42 Entities participate event person date location linked relations event entity The drawback approach decide priori relations represented binary relations standard RDF triples relations cast event entities additional annotations A second approach time representation reiﬁcation Reiﬁcation creates fact identiﬁer fact Then links fact identiﬁer subject predicate object original fact additional RDF triples This leads substantial blowup storage space makes browsing querying inconvenient In contrast speciﬁc form reiﬁcation YAGO2 fact identiﬁers built Most facts represented standard triples fact identiﬁers needed Moreover SPOTL view data makes exploring querying easy A approach representation metainformation use named graphs 73 soon W3C standard A named graph set RDF statements Named graphs allow focusing speciﬁc knowledge bases making statements certain knowledge bases annotating entire knowledge bases trust To represent time space annotations named graphs RDF statement form named graph This like huge overkill spirit original intention named graphs A fourth approach 7475 extends RDF triples quadruples quads short The fourth component primarily serves represent provenance triple kinds metafacts like validity time ﬂuents The SPOTL model YAGO2
