commonly affects urogenital skin This disease affects male female time In male referred balanitis xerotica obliterans BXO frequently causes skin lesion glans The exact reason disease currently unclear A variety factors believed relations disease chronic infection poor hygiene autoimmune factors1 Human papillomavirus HPV known oncogenic effect thought possible relationship LS2 Many studies carried

higher EBV prevalence indicated EBV related development LS4 The main aim study investigate presence HPV EBV male LS patients clarify possible link virus infection LS To knowledge study investigate EBV presence male LS patients MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients This study approved Ethics Committee Shanghai 6th Hospital We searched medical records hospital 2009 2014 male patients diagnosis LS Inclusion criteria 1 pathologic evidence LS 2 Have typical clinical manifestation LS secondary phimosis white plaques foreskin glans urethral stricture 3 Have accessible paraffin embedded tissue 4 Have conclusive medical record covering history present previous diseases clinical manifestations laboratory tests imaginary exams Patients receive surgery hospital excluded 47 patients matched standards included study They divided groups according stage disease The group n 36 mean age 491 consists late stage patients developed long urethral strictures All prolonged dysuria 4 30 years urethrogram showed urethral strictures ranged 3 15 cm Thirtysix patients received lingual mucosa urethroplasty skin lesions glans biopsied The group n 11 mean age 308 consists early stage patients urethral stricture meatal stenosis They came hospital complaint phimosis dysuria white plaque foreskin All complete phimosis Seven typical clinical manifestation LS seven patients meatal stenosis These 11 patients received circumcision patients meatal stenosis received meatotomy The pathologic examination excised foreskin revealed LS characteristics 11 patients None 47 patients systemic diseases like

collection analysis All patients slides reviewed pathologist By request provided patients clinical information like appearing skin lesion age urethrogram blind patients personal information The pathologist reviewed inflammatory reaction slide classified grades severe moderate slight DNA extraction PCR procedures performed experienced technician given information patients Data collected analyzed IBM SPSS 22 IBM We performed descriptive analytical statistic methods like Chisquare test signedrank test RESULTS The mean age control group younger LS group 245 vs 448 P 001 Since healthy young adults source normal foreskin samples age control group naturally younger And LS chronic disease commonly seen senior population Its difficult healthy foreskin samples healthy people matches age LS patients use control samples younger people All samples betaactin target saw amplification Ct lower 30 indicating problem extraction amplification process All samples HPV DNA target amplification

recent study carried China prevalence highrisk HPV rural Chinese males 6412 But study 77 samples detectable highrisk HPV DNA This result little surprising naturally brings suspects extraction detection process We performed 2 runs 77 samples In runs detected samples IPC target 30 cycles positive control negative control normal Thus assume extraction amplification worked alright 77 samples

pathogenesis LS EBV infection common children adolescents Its estimated China 90 children 5 years detectable EBV antibodies EBV known risk factor nasopharyngeal carcinoma possible relationship autoimmune diseases EBV infection usually selflimited infection patients remain latent infection state virus remain small portion B cells circulation lymphatic organs In state virus significant cytopathic effects infected B cells dont release infectious virus13 But persistent existence virus DNA lymphocytes induce immortalization trigger malignancy possible relationship autoimmune diseases1416 One article reported higher infection rate EBV vulvar LS patients4 There report presence EBV oral lichen planus similar atrophic disease involves oral mucosa17 In study 133 healthy foreskin samples detectable EBV Because male foreskin normally contain lymphoid tissue believe EBV healthy foreskin samples mainly came B cells residual blood skin tissue Small bleeding inevitable circumcision pinching stretching surgery contribute local congestion The residual blood excised tissue greatly variable Considering high prevalence EBV infection developing countries18 EBV test possibly positive residual blood excised tissue We notice virus load control group exceeds 1 105 Our study shows LS patients higher EBV infection rate higher virus load Samples EBV load higher 1 106 significant inflammatory reaction Considering highest virus load control group exceed 1 105 virus load mainly comes circulatory lymphocytes assume EBV LS effected tissue mainly comes inflammatory cells The pathological change early stage LS characterized hyperkeratosis inflammatory cell infiltration dermis previous studies penile vulvar LS indicate inflammatory cells wholly mainly T cells host EBV1921 We believe percentage B cells small large inflammatory cells tissue contribute high absolute number B cells host EBV There study reported high portion B cells LS cases22 Also late stage LS samples reduced inflammatory reaction low virus load All facts suggest inflammatory cells main source EBV LS affected tissue circulatory B cells The high prevalence EBV LS affected tissue high EBV load late stage LS patients suggest local EBV infection related LS unclear EBV infection initially triggered inflammation changes presence EBV caused unspecific inflammation eventually transform LS Though late stage LS patients high EBV load patients long history LS panurethra stricture diminished inflammation low EBV load That suggest late stage disease advance LS independent local EBV infection lacks evidence After exact role EBV pathogenesis LS unclear CONCLUSION HPV relationship pathogenesis male LS The affected tissue male LS patients contains higher load EB virus healthy tissue indicating possible association EBV infection pathogenesis LS AUTHORS CONTRIBUTIONS YMZ collected samples carried experiments analyzed data wrote manuscript QF organized project supervised entire
