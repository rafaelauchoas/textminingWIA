In words want ad hoc distribution To address need turn game theory section provide wellbehaved principled solution 6 Games coalitional form Shapley value In section deﬁnitions games coalitional form Shapley value Deﬁnition 7 Let N 1 n set n players A game coalitional form given function v 2N R v 0 This framework deﬁnes games abstract way focusing possible coalition formations A coalition subset N This function gives payoff achieved coalition game v members act unit There numerous questions worthwhile investigate framework One questions know player expect given game v This depends position game

group But main aim players In particular note coalitions bring nearly 1 2 2 3 gives respectively 10 11 shared 2 players So far certain grand coalition form case Another remark game players share situation In particular player 2 great value coalition joins So able expect game players For example offer player 3 making coalition 2 3 brings 11 split 8 player 2 3 player 3 As hard player 3 win
