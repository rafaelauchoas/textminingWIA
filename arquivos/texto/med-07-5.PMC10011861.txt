presentation A 53yearold man presented department dermatology symptoms oral lichen planus papular erythematous rash chest arms The patient previously treated 2 courses methylprednisolone maximum 32 mgday slowly tapered maintenance dose 2 mg 2 days However patients symptoms recurred times lowering dose 4 mgday Additional symptoms included weight loss 5 kilograms months The patient relevant medical family history Initially patient treated corticosteroids hydroxychloroquine However patient noticed symptoms returned attempts stop initial corticosteroids treatment For reason treatment regimen changed acitretin second generation retinoid Workup laboratory tests chest Xray performed showing evidence lymphadenopathy shown Subsequent computed tomography CT positron emission tomography PET chest showed large anterior mediastinal mass maximum diameter 10 centimetres Figure 1A1B Figure 2 A core needle biopsy performed showed spindle shaped cells lymphoid cells Additional tests showed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase TdT cluster differentiation 3 CD3 CD5 positivity lymphoid cells Furthermore pancytokeratin CKpan positive spindleshaped cells This led pathological diagnosis thymoma type AB Furthermore flow cytometry showed low Bcell count CD4CD8 ratio Table 1 Acetylcholine receptor antibodies present In addition findings laboratory analysis revealed HGG Table 2 The

previously unknown pathogen autoimmune reaction B cell progenitors 14 Some authors hypothesized development autoimmune response GS patients multi factorial A number viruses bacteria postulated cause

studies patients agammaglobulinemia showed paradoxically patients B cell deficiencies showed milder courses disease require mechanical ventilation 1719 In patient COVID19 infection severe conservative measures proved sufficient Nevertheless patient demonstrate prolonged COVID19 shedding 14 weeks postoperatively doses mRNA vaccinations Regular administration immunoglobulin replacement therapy resulted stable condition new signs infection More data aetiology underlying immunopathology necessary fully understand GS create better treatment options Furthermore data clinical outcomes COVID19
