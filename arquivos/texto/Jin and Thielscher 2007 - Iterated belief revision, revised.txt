Belief revision new evidence prioritized relatively recent topic studied researchers 5101218 In paper concentrate problem prioritized belief revision iterations necessary In situations new evidence

This kind revision referred severe revision 13 To provide general design criteria belief revision operators set postulates developed 3 As ﬁrst argued AGM trio later frequently repeated 913 guiding

revision operator satisﬁes R1R6 C1C4 Theorem 3 implies DP postulates impose constraints change conditional beliefs The following result shows fact Postulate C2 puts additional constraints retention propositional beliefs Proposition 1 Amnesic revision satisﬁes C1 C3 C4 violates C2 To knowledge observation formalized 6 Y Jin M Thielscher Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 118 23 Two radical cases A different approach studying iterated belief revision deﬁning concrete revision operators For instance 6 proposed speciﬁc revision operator known natural revision satisﬁes modiﬁed KM postulates following CB If Ψ μ cid3 β Ψ μ β Ψ β It easy DP postulates weakening Postulate CB sense Postulate CB implies DP postulates vice versa As shown 79 Postulate CB imposes absolute minimization change conditional beliefs Theorem 4 Suppose revision operator satisﬁes Postulates R1R6 The operator satisﬁes Postulate CB iff operator corresponding faithful assignment satisfy CBR If w1 w2 Ψ μ w1 cid2Ψ w2 iff w1 cid2Ψ μ w2 Note w2 w2 Ψ μ case relative ordering w1 w2 Ψ μ determined cid2Ψ μ satisfy conditions Deﬁnition 2 Therefore Condition CBR imposes absolute minimization change conditional beliefs permitted modiﬁed KM postulates At ﬁrst glance Condition CBR complies principle economy information However following example Darwiche Pearl shows Postulate CB radical severe revision forces cancel previous evidences circumstances usually desirable Example 1 We encounter strange new animal appears bird believe animal bird As comes closer hiding place clearly animal red believe red bird To remove doubts animal birdhood bird expert takes examination concludes bird sort mammal The question believe animal red As argued 9 reason belief animal red birdhood color cor related However natural revision requires belief animals color According Postulate CB bird red cid3 bird follows bird red bird bird bird The discussion suggests conservative way changing conditional beliefs overly strict desirable general While natural revision conservative possible DP revision operators revision operator called lexicographic revision naked evidence 31 sits exactly opposite spectrum Lexico graphic revision

independent sentences undesirably dependent revision step In Example 1 instance red dependent bird revising red natural revision The problem natural revision assigns lowest degree belief new evidence asserting conditional beliefs independence Thus new evidence depends beliefs survive revision process This explains severe revision necessarily cancels previous evidences Of course merely problem

Thielscher Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 118 4 A postulate independence The analysis previous section shows order overcome problem implicit dependence revision operator explicitly assert conditional beliefs It easy DP postulates require preservation conditional beliefs belief state Ψ revised μ Postulates C1 C2 require add remove certain conditional beliefs Postulate C3 requires retain conditional belief β cid10 μ ﬁnally Postulate C4 requires obtain new conditional belief β cid10 μ Since DP postulates stipulates addition independence assumptions new postulates necessary avoid undesired dependencies As mentioned revision process introduce undesirable dependencies directions That new evidence dependent existing beliefs way round Prior stating new postulate DP postulates impose constraints retention independence information direction In presence KM postulates Postulate C2 implies following Ψ μ Ψ μ μ WC2 If Ψ μ cid3 β Ψ μ μ cid3 β This essentially means β dependent new

reconsidering Example 1 According Ind bird red bird cid3 red given bird bird cid2 red This shows new postulate blocks unreasonable behaviors admitted DP postulates In Section 5 argue Postulate Ind overly strict 41 A representation theorem In order formally justify new postulate ﬁrst provide representation theorem line Theorem 3 Thereafter design concrete belief revision operator satisﬁes Ind Theorem 5 Suppose revision operator satisﬁes Postulates R1R6 The operator satisﬁes Postulate Ind iff operator corresponding faithful assignment satisfy IndR If w1 μ w2 μ w1 cid2Ψ w2 implies w1 Ψ μ w2 The theorems shows Postulate Ind natural overly constrained Condition IndR quires world w1 conforming new evidence plausible world w2 violating new evidence w1 plausible w2 An immediate consequence
