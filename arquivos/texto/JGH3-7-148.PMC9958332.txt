Background Studies reported COVID19 pandemic led increase alcohol consumption alcoholassociated health problems general population Our previous study documented rise severe alcoholrelated hepatitis cases requiring inpatient admission hospital early pandemic 2019 vs 2020 This study assesses rates severe alcoholrelated hepatitis pandemic 2021 Methods We performed retrospective chart review electronic medical record evaluate number cases alcoholrelated hepatitis patients presenting community hospitals Fresno California 2019 prepandemic 2021 A total 547 patients included study We compared demo graphics clinical course outcomes patients alcoholrelated hepatitis prepandemic 2019 early pandemic 2020 later phase pandemic 2021 Results The number cases increased 131 2019 201 2020 215 2021 53
