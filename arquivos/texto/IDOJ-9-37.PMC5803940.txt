Diffuse lipomatosis macrodystrophica lipomatosis tuberous sclerosis complex Introduction group conditions Lipomatosis characterized diffuse infiltration adipose tissue Histologically lipomatosis composed normal adulttype adipocytes evidence cellular pleomorphism There rare case reports diffuse lipomatosis Here report case diffuse lipomatosis tuberous sclerosis complex Case Report 24yearold male A presented gradually progressive diffuse swelling right lower limb childhood It associated paresthesia sensorymotor function impairment Apart limb swelling history multiple asymptomatic facial papules early childhood His sister similar facial lesions seizure disorder On physical examination diffuse swelling right lower limb extending groin mid leg Figure 1 Multiple dilated tortuous veins seen right thigh leg No visible capillary venous malformations appreciated There multiple discrete reddishbrown telangiectatic papules face involving nasolabial furrows cheeks Figure 2a Multiple ash leafshaped hypopigmented patches variable sizes trunk Figure 2b Soft seen firm skincolored papules coalescing form plaque left lateral trunk Figure 2b On oral mucosal examination dental pits gingival fibromas seen Figure 2a right Fine needle aspiration smears multiple thigh swelling passes showed lobules mature adipose tissue On magnetic resonance imaging MRI right lower limb altered signal intensity T1weighted hyper T2weighted hyperintense involving musculature compartments right thigh leg suggestive fatty infiltration multiple prominent tortuous vessels suggestive venous channels Figure 3 There associated cortical thickening right femur tibia anterior bowing deformity femur On Doppler scan incompetent perforators multiple great saphenous vein territory noted Discussion rare lipomatosis tumorous Diffuse condition characterized progressive growth extension mature adipose tissue involve skeletal muscle trunk extremities Rarely osseous involvement feature1 Its etiology known

adulthood Our case typical clinical features diffuse lipomatosis confirmed cytology MRI syndrome The clinical differentials considered patient KlippelTrenaunay syndrome Proteus syndrome macrodystrophica ParkesWeber lipomatosa However capillary lymphatic arteriovenous malformation suggest KlippelTrenaunay syndrome ParkesWeber syndrome epidermal naevi cerebriform plantar naevi suggest Proteus syndrome Macrodystrophica close differential diffuse lipomatosis overlapping clinical radiological features However macrodystrophica lipomatosis typically shows hypertrophy nerves lipomatosis proliferation fat MRI Other differences conditions listed Table 1 Multiple angiofibromas shagreen patch ash leaf macules fulfill diagnosis definite tuberous sclerosis complex case To best knowledge previous reports association tuberous sclerosis complex diffuse lipomatosis23 The case reported Klein et al2 lower limb involvement Alcazar et al3 reported dorsal transthoracic involvement Constitutive activation mTORC1 Mammalian Target Rapamycin Complex 1 major pathological consequence mutations TSC1 TSC2 seen tuberous sclerosis complex Inhibition mTOR pathway rapamycin shown effective treating cutaneous manifestations tuberous sclerosis complex45 It shown mTORC1 suppresses lipolysis stimulates lipogenesis promotes fat storage6 In addition activating mutations PIK3CA mTOR pathway acting upstream TSC complex facial infiltrating lipomatosis7 Conclusion In conclusion association diffuse lipomatosis tuberous sclerosis complex needs assessment difficult explain asymmetrical involvement lipomatosis cells carry TSC mutation Additional genetic mutations complex pathways involved requires characterization Figure 1 Diffuse swelling right lower limb extending groin mid leg
