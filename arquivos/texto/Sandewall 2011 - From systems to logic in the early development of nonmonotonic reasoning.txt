logic represent function conventional terms follows Consider application domain containing kind identiﬁable objects natural functions object object arguments function value arguments values Terms ambiguity logic interpreted sets objects There expressions individual objects sets instead special predicate argument true iff argument singleton set having exactly member The subset subsetequal relations usual Furthermore ambiguously valued function f object level application offers introduces corresponding function F set level F A set objects value function f applied member A Setlevel functions argument deﬁned similarly Obviously function F monotonic respect subset relation arguments The basic concept ambiguity logic subset relation sets objects use predicates occur predicate logic There evident similarity modern descriptionlanguage representations Predicates object level considered functions value objects T F consequently counterparts set level possible values In addition monotonic functions including predicates constructed objectlevel counterparts convenient special functions monotonic The subset relation considered value T F monotonic holds predicate single argument Quantiﬁcation expressed subset relation objectlevel predicate p true members set A iff P A T true member set iff T P A The generalization predicates arguments trivial Implication handled similar
