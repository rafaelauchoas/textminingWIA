detection condition timely termination pregnancy conducted Keywords Cyclopia synophtalmia newborn Democratic Republic Congo Date received 5 June 2022 accepted 22 September 2022 Introduction Synophtalmia cyclopia extreme sign associated alobar holoprosencephaly severe form holopros encephaly HPE rare birth defect incidence 1 100000 newborns1 The condition named singleeyed giant Cyclops
