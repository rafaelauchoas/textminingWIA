formulas called labels The labels contents effects deductions For instance label indicates formula better supported evidence deductions better 1060 ML Anderson et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 2008

inconsistent information We mention LDS evidence simple version active logic SL7 described 17 likewise implemented described LDS 3 This interesting ﬁnding clear version active logic described likewise expressed LDS turn case Even active logic special case LDS interesting valuable properties nonmonotonicity paraconsistency temporal sensitivity Another interesting general framework called adaptive
