Such model bargaining problems called ordinal bargaining model A bargaining solution ordinal built ordinal bargaining model We like remark bargaining solution built Nash bargaining model ordinal long

ordinal bargaining solutions literature built numerical models 3253537 The ordinal bargaining models ordinal information relatively easier obtain cardinal util ities 36 Asked prefer coffee tea provide

orderpreserving transformation Therefore information bargainers risk attitudes lost This suggests additional components introduced ordinal bargaining models express bargainers risk attitudes Rubinstein et al introduced variation ordinal bargaining model preference ordering player extended space lotteries possible agreements disagreement 33 A player express attitudes risk preference

gametheoretic bargaining solutions Nash solution KalaiSmorodinsky solution 2 The bargaining model Bargaining process set agents interact reach agreement To model bargaining situation demands bargainer logical statements The demands bargainers conﬂict collectively logically inconsistent Successful bargaining result mutually acceptable agreement compromises demands bargainers logically consistent statements To facilitate logical model bargaining assume propositional language L The language consists ﬁnite set propositional variables standard propositional connectives We apply standard syntax semantics propositional logic Propositional sentences denoted ϕ ψ As usual symbol cid9 denotes derivability concept logical consistency deﬁned usual Let cid3 binary relation nonempty set X cid3 total preorder complete transitive reﬂexive order X satisﬁes following properties Completeness totality For ϕ ψ X ϕ cid3 ψ ψ cid3 ϕ Reﬂexivity For ϕ X ϕ cid3 ϕ Transitivity For ϕ ψ χ X ϕ cid3 ψ ψ cid3 χ ϕ cid3 χ 21 Demands bargainer Given bargaining situation n participants assume ﬁnal agreement represented collection logical statements language speciﬁed Each participant bargaining requests ﬁnal agreement contains set statements referred demands bargainer7 For example buyer price negotiation demands price product 10 warranty fewer years In addition assume bargainer preference statements demands indicating eagerly wants statements written ﬁnal agreement Formally represent bargainers demands preferences following structure Deﬁnition 1 A demand set L pair X cid3 X ﬁnite logically consistent set sentences L cid3 total preorder X As mentioned demand set represents statements agent wants agreement negotiation stipulate The ordering demand set represents ﬁrmly agent insists demands higher ﬁrmer In situations ordering recorded observing sequence demands agent gives course bargaining later dropped ﬁrmer Note preference ordering player represent payoff player receives associated demands For instance suppose players bargain partition cake Section 5 A player receives highest payoff gets cake However getting cake entrenched demand player want reach agreement players insist demand agreement reached In addition preference ordering player purely private information A player great advantage knows players preference orderings However advantage players information research topic strategic models called noncooperative models bargaining 1 We like remark general demand set player nonempty means player participate negotiation However use demand set cid3 indicate situation player discontinues negotiation Let X cid3 demand set For ϕ ψ X write ϕ ψ denote ϕ cid3 ψ ψ cid3 ϕ Obviously equiva lence relation X Furthermore ϕ cid12 ψ denotes ϕ cid3 ψ ψ cid13cid3 ϕ Occasionally use cid4 reverse order cid3 cid12 respectively 7 We statements demands players beliefs goals desired constraints commonsense player wants ﬁnal agreement contain 1310 D Zhang Artiﬁcial

nagent bargaining games language L denoted GnL There special kinds bargaining situations The ﬁrst kind agents discontinues ongoing negotiation withdrawing demands In case consider negotiation

Deﬁnition 4 A bargaining game Xi cid3iiN said represent disagreement situation Xk k It said nonconﬂictive represent disagreement situation iN Xi logically consistent cid2 For better understanding bargaining model let consider negotiation scenario Example 1 Two political parties Parliament bargain government rescue plan response 2008 ﬁnan cial crisis Each party identify speciﬁc beneﬁts different approach propose different rescue plans Party A wants available funds major banks leave small portion creating job opportuni ties Party B close relationship automobile industry insists investing car manufacturers Party B proposes money spent helping people hold signiﬁcant mortgage debt8 Both parties know need money sides house mortgages mortgagees mortgagers Also parties real ize putting money auto industry ﬁnancial institutions government incur unprecedented heavy deﬁcit However Party A holds low deﬁcit policy9 Suppose let cars rescue automobile industry banks rescue major banks mortgagers help house mortgagers jobs create job opportunities deﬁcit heavy government deﬁcit Then Party As demands written cid3 X A banks jobs deﬁcit banks mortgagers cars banks deﬁcit cid4 Party Bs demands cid3 X B cars mortgagers banks mortgagers cars banks deﬁcit cid4 Now suppose Party As preference demands 8 For instance house owners property values lower mortgage debts ﬁnancial

Party Bs preference banks mortgagers B cars banks deﬁcit cid12B cars cid12B mortgagers Therefore bargaining problem modeled game X A cid3 A X B cid3B Obviously satisfy demands parties write demands ﬁnal agreement logically inconsistent The inconsistency identiﬁed follows banks mortgagers banks mortgagers cid9 cars banks deﬁcit cars banks deﬁcit cid9 One notice statements banks mortgagers cars banks deﬁcit like constraints demands Both parties request writing statements ﬁnal agreement statements repre sent parties standpoints For Party B Party A agree banks mortgagers However dropping

Suppose negotiation carried following arbitration procedure At beginning negotiation participants submit demands arbitrator charge negotiation If conﬂict demands negotiation terminates agreement simply collection demands negotiation moves stage agent options concession withdrawing number demands agent allowed add new demands declare breakdown case negotiation terminates agreement11 The procedure continues remaining demands consistent The following subsections formalize procedure 10 This axiom referred contraction independence 42 11 We consider possibility negotiation continues agent
