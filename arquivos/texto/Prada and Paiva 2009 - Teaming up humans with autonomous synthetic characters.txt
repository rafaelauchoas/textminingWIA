structure usually divided different dimensions The common dimensions according Jesuíno 34 structure communication reﬂects communication network connects group members structure social power reﬂects social inﬂuence members exert structure social attraction sociometric structure reﬂects social attraction members feel R Prada A Paiva Artiﬁcial Intelligence 173 2009 80103 85 Furthermore according Collins Raven 19 structure group characterised terms inter personal relations established members This means interpersonal relations social power related emergence groups structure social power interpersonal relations social attraction related emergence groups structure social attraction Therefore order understand dynamics groups structure interactions imperative understand dynamics interpersonal social relations 341 Relations social power French Raven 24 deﬁned notion social power inﬂuence exerted social agent person social agent person social role norm group group This inﬂuence deﬁned terms psychological change persons perceptions emotions behaviours attributed action social agent However social power deﬁnes potential inﬂuence person On hand person mobilise effort resist inﬂuence On hand social agent decide use power inﬂuence process Therefore social inﬂuence exerted person results strength power social agent induces reduced strength resistance mobilised person Furthermore French Raven 2461 proposed characterisation power according social source relation person social agent 1 Reward Power based perceived ability mediate rewards 2 Coercive Power based perceived ability mediate punishments 3 Legitimate Power referred organisational authority based perception right prescribe given behaviours 4 Referent Power based perceived associations person social agent example affective relationship 5 Expert Power based perceived distinctive knowledge expertness abilities skills attributed social agent 6 Information Power based perceived control information needed order reach important goal These different types social power interrelated combined process social inﬂuence For example speaker renown expertise given ﬁeld inﬂuence opinion listener expert power However listener dislikes speaker inﬂuence reduced negative referent power In addition process inﬂuence depends perception person inﬂuenced For example member attached group conforms norms fears ridiculed expelled group inﬂuenced coercive power However conforms order obtain praise inﬂuenced reward power Furthermore member conforms avoid discomfort gain satisfaction independently groups responses inﬂuenced referent power Finally member conforms majoritys opinion based respect collective wisdom group inﬂuenced expert power The perception power effects group process For example according Hurwitz et al 33 Lippitt et al 40 members group higher social power usually appreciated rest group interactions likely drive groups behaviour In addition attracted group satisﬁed groups interactions They tend underestimate efforts members inﬂuence group use power way self assertion 3536 342 Relations social attraction The relations social attraction ﬁrst studied Moreno 52 deﬁne
