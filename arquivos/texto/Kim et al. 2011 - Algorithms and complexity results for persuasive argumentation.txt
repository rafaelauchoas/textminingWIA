zk P Furthermore exists argument z cid8 t ηt ηz t z Acid2 z attack argument x1 xk t In ﬁrst case z P inﬂuence membership P arguments X In second case z P attack argument x1 xk t In cases follows xk P Using C3 follows zk1 P know zk P follows xk1 P A repeated application arguments establishes claim x1 P follows Conversely suppose exists speciﬁc audience cid2 x1 contained unique preferred extension P GEF cid2 F cid2 We construct certifying path C x1 F Clearly z1 X x1 ηz1 ηx1 z1 x1 A x1 certifying path x1 F Hence remains consider case z1 exists Since x1 P follows z1 P The sequence x1 z1 clearly satisﬁes properties C1C3 We extend sequence certifying path x1 F Hence let S x1 z1 xl zl sequence satisfying conditions C1C3 addition assume S satisﬁes following conditions S1 It holds ηx1 ηxl S2 For 1 cid2 cid2 l xi P zi P Clearly sequence x1 z1 satisﬁes S1 S2 include conditions induction hypothesis It remains extend S certifying path Let Y y P y zl A η y ηxl ηzl Then Y cid8 zl P condition S2 assumption P preferred extension For y Y let C y x1 z1 xl zl y If argument y Y C y certifying path x1 F Hence assume y Y We choose xl1 Y arbitrarily Note C xl1 satisﬁes condition C4 xl1 zl A xl1 Y xl1 xi A 1 cid2 cid2 l xl1 xi P P conﬂictfree Since assume C xl1 certifying path C xl1 violate C5 It follows exists argument zl1 ηzl1 ηxl1 xl1 zl1 A zl1 xi A cid5 x1 z1 xl zl xl1 zl1 satisﬁes conditions C1C3 S1S2 Hence 1 cid2 cid2 l 1 We conclude S able extend S eventually obtain certifying path x1 F cid2 Proof Lemma 2 Assume x1 objectively accepted F Suppose p X attacks x1 ηp ηx1 If speciﬁc audience cid2 ηx1 greatest element x1 unique preferred extension F cid2 contradiction assumption x1 objectively accepted Hence ηp cid8 ηx1 arguments p X attack x1 Next suppose argument p X attacks x1 subjectively accepted F ηx1 Let cid2 speciﬁc audience p unique preferred extension F ηx1cid2 We extend cid2 total ordering V ensuring ηx1 cid2 ηp Clearly x1 unique preferred extension F cid2 contradiction Hence p X attack x1 ηp cid8 ηx1 p subjectively accepted F ηx1 We establish reverse direction proving counter positive Assume x1 objectively accepted F We exists p X attacks x1 ηp ηx1 p subjectively accepted F ηx1 Let cid2 speciﬁc audience F x1 unique preferred extension P GEF cid2 F cid2 In view labeling procedure ﬁnding P sketched Section 2 follows exists p P attacks x1 ηx1 cid2 ηp If ηx1 ηp On hand ηp cid8 ηx1 p unique preferred extension F ηx1cid2 p subjectively accepted F ηx1 cid2 Proof Corollary 1 We slightly modify reduction 3SAT given Section 32 Let C1 Cm clauses 3CNF
