University Medical Sciences Tehran Iran Corresponding Author Abstract OBJECTIVES Digital nerve block painful procedure Several methods proposed decrease injection pain Applying ice pack pertinent choice effectiveness pain reduction convenience low costs In study degree injection pain reduction assessed applying ice pack site anesthetic injection METHODS One participants traumatic finger injury assessed Digital nerve block performed patients intervention group 6 min ice application In control group procedure ice The primary outcome difference needle stick infiltration pain scores ice pack The secondary outcome patient satisfaction score The protocol study approved Institutional Review Board registered Iranian Registry Clinical Trials RESULTS The pain score assessed Numeric Rating Scale Both needle skin infiltration pain scores statistically significantly lower intervention group P 0001 The mean median needle stick pain scores 15 10 intervention group 68 70 control group respectively Moreover mean median infiltration pain scores 27 20 intervention group 85 90 control group respectively Patient satisfaction score significantly higher intervention group CONCLUSIONS Ice pack

We applied ice 6 min similar previous studies shown applying ice 5 min ineffective pain reduction increase pain level The results studies indicate precooling time important Needle size pain perception In study injection performed 27G needle good effect pain perception according previous studies31415 The results study suggest ice application 6 min digital nerve block reduces needle stick infiltration pain Ice application easy procedure inexpensive available emergency room Patients asked place ice packs fingers preparation We assessed patient satisfaction procedure groups statistically significantly higher ice group P 0001 Limitations First measure finger skin temperature needling timewasting crowded emergency ward help learn ideal temperature pain control Second ice pieces rolled finger base temperature skin areas maybe different time influence pain perception Third follow patients duration wound healing study Further studies needed evaluate effect ice duration wound healing
