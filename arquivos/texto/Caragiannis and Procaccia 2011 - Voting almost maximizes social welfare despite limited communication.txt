different interpretations Procaccia Rosenschein 13 motivate work arguing systems voting utilities calculated compared exact comparable utilities conceivably exist This situation common systems populated entirely computational agents bounded rationality issue common systems involve humans Procaccia Rosenschein assume agents rank alternatives according decreasing utility require calculating exact utilities In contrast randomized embeddings introduced paper require computation exact utilities So dealing systems presumably populated solely computational agents potentially gather exact utilities select best alternative One possible interpretation results improve performance systems design unnecessarily constrained use voting utilities reported approach wish advocate We feel interpretation terms communication reduction presented introduction provides robust motivation ties closely results 62 Relation work compact preferences A signiﬁcant body work AI devoted compactly representing preferences A prominent example work CPnets 2 graphical representation preferences employs conditional ceteris paribus equal prefer ence statements This representation compact admits eﬃcient algorithms different inference tasks Another example recently proposed representation utility functions weighted propositional formulas 17 By consider ing different restrictions syntax formulas weights obtain different representation languages capturing different class utility functions This line work proposes reduce communication computation burdens making arguably natural assumptions utility functions In contrast paper impose restrictions utility functions ex ception extremely weak normalization assumption reduce communication slightly relaxing optimality outcome 63 Generality normalized utilities It easy strong lower bounds hold assuming utilities normalized We argue assumption essentially loss generality Indeed setting mind consistent motivation examples agents equal weight deciding social quality alternatives merely trying evaluate alternative best For example precluding situation agent utility x zero rest second agent utility 12 x zero rest believe x
