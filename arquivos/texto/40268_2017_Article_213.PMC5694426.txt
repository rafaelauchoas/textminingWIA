Introduction Despite consensus guidelines 1 debate continues potential harms statin use 2 Much case harms rests realworld reported evidence adverse events 14 metaanalyses randomized clin ical trials

unmeasured confounding bias rate 624 M D Huesch reported effects This particularly case confounding indication exists indications statin prescription independently associated effects potential causeway statin use Such bias difﬁcult impossible adjust 9 Second realworld use statins unblinded ascertainment bias impact reporting effects 10 Without masking treatment assignments possible patients physicians wrongly attribute effect use statins 11 Such effect suggested recent Odyssey Alternative trial 16 patients documented statin intolerance screened 4week placebo runin period sug gesting

AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes TrialLipidLowering Arm ASCOTLLA recently compared events nonrandomized non blinded followon phase events reported earlier randomized blinded phase 13 This
