stable clinical situations statins mediate primary benefit mainly lowdensity lipoprotein reduction LDL hypothesis However acute situations pure lowdensity lipoprotein reduction fully explain cardiac protection Statins prevent formation cholesterol precursor mevalonate produce important downstream nonlipid pleiotropic effects inhibiting HMCoAR Mevalonate depletion limits production isoprenoid decreases formation Rho Ras proteins involved intracellular signaling pathways Endotheliumdependent vasodilatation human coronary arteries correlates susceptibility LDL oxidation Many factors influence susceptibility LDL oxidation including size composition LDL susceptibility oxidative modification Oxidative stress inactivates nitric oxide decreases expression endothelial nitric oxide
