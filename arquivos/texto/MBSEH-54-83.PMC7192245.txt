Hospital Istanbul Turkey Abstract Objectives Transient Ischemic Attack TIA temporary lack adequate blood oxygen brain TIAs typically 24 hours 1015 ischemic stroke patients history TIA 18 experience ischemic stroke 90 days ABCD2 scoring estimate risk Our study aims investigate risk factors etiology lesion occurrence MRI nearterm risk stroke patients TIA diagnosed Methods In study 124 patients included January 2012 January 2018 Sixtyeight 124 patients male The history patients questioned systemic neurological examinations The stroke risk factors TIA duration noted ABCD2 scores calculated All patients blood samples including glucose lipid profile studied They received CT DWI MRI electrocardiography transthoracic echocardiography ultrasound andor MR angiography cervical arteries Results One twentyfour patients included study 56 patients female The mean age 63041677 Hypertension common risk factor 508 Twentyseven patients antithrombotic patients anticoagulant therapy 91 patients receiving antiaggregan therapy ABCD2 scores significantly higher antithrombotic therapy group p0019 In 52 patients ABCD2 score 4 72 patients score greater 4 In 677 patients etiology An ischemic lesion detected 169 patients 58 patients discharged anticoagulant therapy Five patients developed ischemic stroke Conclusion The risk factors ischemic stroke TIAs similar factors The etiology TIAs patients
