Finally intermediate solutions example n evalu ated w reevaluated single world agent n_ 1 considers possible Since m 1 preceding names m reasonable pos sible ways evaluate n We innermost scope types outerscope interpretation Our task possibilities important Innermost scope easiest motivate Suppose agent knows 4p Of course agent names proper sign messages particular physical location role organization Suppose later agent named m learns IS knowledge If think m learn realize happens m learns agent named n n names knows 4p For example send signed message m Therefore state knowledge KK n read innermost scope In general simple compositional semantics innermost scope parallels process knowledge acquisition Unfortunately innermost scope express Consider users natural language use names knowledge contexts If I assert example You know I know time I refers person Im addressing So try formalize KKl I outermost innermost scope Many similar examples demonstrate outerscope interpretations natural Moreover outer scopes useful concrete domains science Here example later An agent sends message M received exactly agent doesnt know 3 Note way reason agent descriptive title like recipientofM Suppose information contained M previously known subsequently learned receives message M For example M contain key chosen encrypting messages Now suppose fact agent b recipient M b sends message M agent c b tell c message M Finally suppose later c talking reveals proves c received M saw M For example case M encrypted key sent M Although c knows b neglects tell What known c One interesting observation c knows recipientofM sent M true long recipientofM read outemzost scope denotes agent b Agent c doesnt actually know message M message sent assertion innermost scope false situation So produced outerscope assertion accurately describes aspect cs knowledge 3 More precisely mean agent named This distinction important example 322 AJ GroveArtiJiciul Intelligence 74 I 995 31 I350 However
