pneumococcal disease IPD However uptake pneumococcal vaccination tends lower immunosuppressed partly concerns vaccine effectiveness Our institution introduced protocolised 10 13valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination PCV allogeneic autologous HSCT recipients 2010 replace routine 23valent polysaccharide vaccine PPV23 Methods We conducted retrospective singlecentre observational study HSCT recipients 2004 2015 assess impact PCV introduction IPD incidence All HSCT recipients reviewed microbiological evidence IPD following HSCT The pre2010 group HSCT recipients receive PCV compared post2010 group HSCT recipients receive PCV Enrolment compliance postHSCT vaccination protocol assessed Results Of 917 HSCT screened IPD 14 episodes IPD occurred 12 patients 2004 2016 Twelve episodes
