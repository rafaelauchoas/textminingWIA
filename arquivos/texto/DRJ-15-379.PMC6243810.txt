ranking according CONSORT 2010 checklist shows study method employed Rassameemasmaung S closer standards clinical trials tea mouthwash As shown included articles early effect green comparison baseline statistically significant There vivo vitro studies support effectiveness green tea reducing halitosis Zeng et al vitro study showed ability green tea remove odorant sulfurs They showed intensifying effect adding herbal acetone powder green tea reducing halitosis Zeng et al 2010 The results Lodhia et al support adverse effect green tea oral malodor According vivo study green tea reduced hydrogen sulfide H2S methyl mercaptan CH3SH concentration specifically consumption28 It important CH3SH related halitosis H2S29 The deodorizing mechanism EGCG based reaction CH3SH methylthio andor methylsulfinyl group reacts B ring EGCG In process methylthio group added orthoquinone form catechin oxidated atmospheric oxygen results reduction bad odor Yasuda et al 1995 Furthermore green tea contains zinc30 considered possible ingredients contributing antihalitosis effects It affects VSCss converts nonmalodorous compounds3132 It reported mouthwashcontaining zinc reduce VSCs 80 3 h33 However zinc content green tea varies different green teas species30 Therefore considering green tea high concentration zinc result antihalitosis effects It noted study showed early reduction halitosis green tea group similar control group This finding justified rinsing effect mouthwashes regardless components In included studies green tea mouthwash potentially rinse VSCs reduce oral cavity In second article longterm effect green tea mouthwash shown explained antimicrobial activity green tea inhibitory effect growth VSCproducing bacteria3435 The study Morin et al showed inhibitory effect EGCG green tea extract Solobacterium moorei bacterium interrupting bacterial cell membrane integrity36 S moorei Grampositive anaerobic bacterium highly prevalent halitosis patients3738 It reported EGCG green tea decrease adhesion S moorei Porphyromonas gingivalis oral epithelial cells3639 The tannin content green tea considered biosynthetic antimicrobial agent In study conducted Moghbel et al green tea mouthwashes higher tannin showed powerful bacterial colonies Generally according included articles green tea ability reduce VSCs Based high CONSORT score reported Rassameemasmaung et al green tea suggested possibly longterm effect oral malodor Although considering green tea mouthwash certain medicament halitosis control needs randomized clinical trials sufficient volunteers suggested patients auxiliary treatment treatments CONCLUSION Green tea mouthwash reduce halitosis This effect attributed rinsing activity mouthwash antimicrobial mechanisms green tea This study support clinical prescription green tea certain treatments lack randomized clinical studies green tea mouthwash good treatment choice halitosis treatments achieve better clinical
