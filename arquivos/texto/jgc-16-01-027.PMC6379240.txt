interventional coronary proce dures performed elderly patients patients presenting ACS managed conservatively medical treatment alone11 This beneficial effect invasive strategy reported clinical

individuals likely benefit14 In nonACS setting elective PCI elderly patients shown high procedural success rates rela tively low morbidity suggesting PCI safe effec tive stable CAD elderly patients15 However prognosis patients presenting coronary angiography ACS requiring hospitalization worse explained tendency late arri val presentation atypical symptoms lower chance having timely reperfusion mechanistically elderly patients calcified lesions multivessel involvement requiring complex coronary interventions Similar patterns observed current study showing significantly reduced survival patients presenting ACS underwent coronary angiography nonACS setting In STEMIACS higher rates arrhythmias heart failure mechanical complica tions reported elderly population impacting mor tality16 Nevertheless primary PCI improves cardiovascu lar wellbeing elderly presenting STEMI associated favorable prognosis compared medical management alone17 In nonSTEMI ACS nefit revascularization reported better inhospital 6months outcomes receive medical management alone18 In current study forming revascularization index event associated better survival oneyear mortality rates significant undergoing PCI line cohorts mortality PCI shown increase age19 This explained noncardiac causes develop postprocedural period20 stroke major bleeding episodes renal failure requiring dialysis21 additional
