proposed paradigm shift understanding genetics healthy diseased conditions including cancer book He tried establish holistic view genome expressed karyotype instead reductionism genes epigenes Morphology aberration proposed important change gives rise downstream genetic mutations changes However clear precisely measured SKY Spectral Karyotyping interphase FISH Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization mentioned present It clear statistics calculate aberrations One probably compare snapshots discrete time instead time series estimation probably use linear nonlinearity estimation Though dynamics chaos fuzzy inheritance discussed mention nonlinear complexity measures like Lyapunov fractal dimension calculation This work gives fresh lease tiresome successful subject oncogene albeit nonclinical standpoint After reading time evident hardly easier lucid way present different difficult proposition The author tried cause cancer futility theories based reductionists viewpoint starts approach linear calculation mathematicalnumerical value aberration One wait till useful clinically probably diagnostically begin A glimpse theoryhypothesis basic research medicine This book chapters The chapter introduces subject Why Debate Cancer Why Now The second chapter discusses gene mutation
