opportunities applications These applications especially useful reaching languages common translation systems poor resources lack economic interests Thus applications built PanDictionary potential impact developing nations computing technology far reaching areas technology boom suﬃcient impact 61 Cross lingual image search Monolingual image search Google Images faces challenge images tagged resource rich languages like English Spanish The number images obtained queried resource poor languages small making systems limited global reach Our prototype search engine PanImages shows lexical translations based PanDictionary enabling search concept different languages resulting broader coverage images As product PanImages able offer crosscultural images concept For instance searching breakfast Dutch Japanese Arabic shows culturally different images breakfast Finally image search based translations helps situations original word meanings homonyms languages Currently developing
