Abstract Positive patient experiences associated illness recovery adherence medication To evaluate virtual care experience patients COVID19 symptoms chief complaints We conducted crosssectional study cohort patients COVID19 symptoms virtual clinic The main end points study visit volume wait times visit duration patient diagnosis prescriptions received satisfaction Of 1139 total virtual visits 212 246 patients COVID19 symptoms The average wait time SD visits 755 1216 minutes The average visit duration visits 105 49 minutes The highest volume virtual visits Saturdays 39 lowest volume Friday 19 Patients experienced shorter wait times SD weekdays 671 1068 minutes compared 903 1426 minutes weekends The common diagnoses patients COVID19 symptoms upper respiratory infection Patient wait times

practices Keywords telehealth virtual visits patient experience recommendations Introduction Positive patient experiences associated illness recovery adherence medication 1 On contrary suboptimum patient experiences important implica tions patients health conditions health care costs patients require health care services 23 Traditionally patient experience defined patient reported encounters events occur conti nuum care 4 In virtual world patient experience defined differently Amid COVID19 pandemic virtual care remote exchange health information patient provider 5 new norm temporarily repla cing outpatient services health care delivery Vir tual visits include telephone video calls Social determinants defined conditions people born grow live work play role choice communication preferred patient 6 Young male patients higher chance choosing video telephone compared old female patients 6 Differences workflow virtual care office visits impact patient experience Workflow sequence tasks performed different professionals entities 7 In virtual care patients interact rely professionals complete cer tain tasks For example virtual care patients expected independently

This crosssectional study evaluating expe rience patients COVID19 symptoms virtual care environment We patients COVID19 symptoms diagnosed differently Higher utilization video visits observed younger

symptoms rated virtual expe rience provider positively The convenience trans portation physical interaction praised patients The extralong wait times unprecedented volume calls COVID19 pandemic criticized patients While wait times longer increased volume COVID19 cases community rising led COVID19related symptoms Resolving wait times fixed increased staffing shortage medical providers inperson virtual environments remains challenge time The rela tively low satisfaction survey response rate explained overall mood patients COVID19 suspicion rush receive care testing complete satisfaction survey Like airline industry virtual clinics consider use callback options highvolume times Additionally providing approximated wait time incredibly valuable improving patient satisfaction Similar aviation industry customer calling airline com pany presented estimated waiting time connect customer service representative Some virtual patients complained feeling rushed virtual visits lack eye contact provider missing clear guidance Since shift virtual care novel virtual care training essential userspatients providers A clear set expecta tions virtual care best practices need developed communicated Telehealth Best Practices In addition briefly suggested best practices 13 created set telehealth best practices based patient reported experiences improve quality virtual visits based COVID19 increased workflow subsequent data collection Our recommendations include general pro vider patient telehealth bestpractices Generally virtual care ways improve telehealth experience regardless participants role First unlike inperson visits participants advised use caution color wearing shiny fabrics busy patterns distracting frustrating party Second setting camera facelevel ease eye contact Third eye contact person speaking position icon screen camera Therefore looking speaking like looking camera Forth recommended stay place virtual visits avoid continuous movement Lastly loud noises background mute speaking Figure 4A Additionally best practice recommendations include webside etiquettes comparable bedside etiquette providers focus eye eye contact speak ing listening patient b ensure private quiet space c physical space setup ergonomi cally adequate lighting acoustics d possible notes minimize typing conversation add noise conversation e guide patients better set environment positioning camera light ning microphone f communicate patient limitations conducting physical exam remotely g ask patient virtual care history reason choosing virtual care better understand manage expectations h expect lagtime allow patient time lis think respond referring patient inperson appointment clearly explain reason referral financial implications j provider point contact patient providers flexible accommodating answering questions Figure 4B For patients important manage set expec tations prior virtual visit To ensure positive experi ence recommend best practices patients Virtual care suit health conditions testing COVID19 essential patients stand suitable health care options avoid unnecessary Khairat et al 671 Figure 4 Telehealth best practices A general B provider C patient costs andor referrals b registration accurate complete patient information expedite workflow pro cess correct appropriate provider c set camera eye level speaking look directly camera avoid bright light background d sure private quiet space e limited internet access consider phone instead video f quality virtual care relies heavily effective communication patients symptoms complaints inform providers decision Figure 4C Limitations Future Work A limitation study inability followup virtual patients prognosis illness post virtual visit We able conduct followup visits assess clinical outcome COVID19related visit The severity illness confounding factor varying levels prescribing patients diagnosis Additionally COVID19 test ing available patients selfadminister unable provide virtual COVID19 testing screen COVID19 infection leading patients referred inperson testing Only 71 patients COVID19 related chief complaints completed survey patient satisfaction In future plan evaluate virtual care outcomes conducting followup surveys asking need hospitalization inperson appointment postvirtual visit Conclusion This study evaluated virtual experiences patients COVID19 symptoms There different experiences patients depending choice communication Long wait times major drawback patient experience We learned evaluating experience cohort COVID19 Concern patients This evaluation pro vided list best practices providers patients use virtual care visits The future holds great promise telehealth COVID19 crisis need optimize
