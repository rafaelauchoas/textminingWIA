tree subactions parallel actions multiple recipes actions performance failure agents actions For instance agent 5 know order perform complex action sufﬁ cient perform subaction b subaction c However agent 5 c agent 3 c If agent 5 asked perform action subcontract agent 3 performance action c There rule agent follows perform action subaction ﬁnds agent action subcontracts action In paper specify rules metaaxioms relating mental states agents sense intentions agents adopt perform certain actions lead actual performance actions If agents designed apply rules cooperative manner prove actions actually performed We use approach mental state model plans 42 Pollacks deﬁnition individual plan individual agent action α includes constituent mental attitudes 1 belief performance certain actions

Instead agent attempts perform actions planning decomposes complex actions simpler actions library recipes The agent maintains belief set includes beliefs times decide adopt intentions These beliefs change time based observations reasoning lead dropping intentions adopting new ones Most previous work mental state model planning lack established semantics especially lack formal treatment time In
