Actinomyces odontolyticus Parvimonas micra rare causative organisms lung abscess acute respiratory failure Patient concerns A 49yearold male patient visited emergency room complaint sudden onset shortness breath developed acute respiratory failure rapidly Diagnosis An abscess left lower lung ﬁeld diagnosed computed tomography scan chest Interventions Immediate treatment intravenous antibiotics initiated pigtail catheter insertion pus drainage Outcomes A odontolyticus cultured drained pus P micra identiﬁed blood culture The patient successfully weaned mechanical ventilator lung abscess completely resolved Lessons To best knowledge ﬁrst case report mixed infection A odontolyticus P micra caused acute respiratory failure immunecompetent patient Therefore physicians consider possibility organisms causative pathogens fulminant pulmonary infection immunecompetent patient Keywords Actinomyces odontolyticus acute respiratory failure infection lung abscess Parvimonas micra 1

pulmonary actinomycosis develop rarely23Parvimonas micra commensal human oral cavity rarely causes pulmonary infections Only cases pulmonary infections identiﬁed pure culture4 In article report case lung abscess mixed infection Actinomyces odontolyticus P micra initially presented acute respiratory failure Patient provided informed consent publication case 2 Case report A 49yearold male patient visited emergency room complaint sudden onset dyspnea developed day hospital visit He complain cough purulent sputum fever He current smoker 20 pack year smoking history heavy alcohol drinking habit His past medical history included hypertension On examination patient alert oriented He poor oral hygiene extensive caries His body temperature 361C blood pressure 13070 mm Hg respiratory rate 35

A computed tomography scan chest showed large lung abscess airﬂuid level left lower hemithorax Fig 1B Ceftriaxone clinda mycin administered promptly percutaneous pigtail catheter inserted drain abscess The drained ﬂuid purulent gross appearance The patient successfully weaned mechanical ventilator 6th day hospital visit A odontolyticus sensitive penicillin clindamycin ampicillin erythromycin P micra sensitive Penicillin amoxicillin clindamycin Therefore antibiotics changed ampicillinsulbactam patient recovered faster The oral examination revealed swelling redness gingiva accumulation dental calculus gingival bleeding probing The percutaneous drainage catheter removed 12th day hospital visit The patient discharged 26th day admission markedly improved symptoms general condition After discharge oral amoxicillinclavulanate prescribed maintenance therapy 6 months left lung lesion resolved Fig 2 tetracycline Figure 2 The followup chest xray showing improvement lung abscess left

Actino myces species grampositive bacteria facultative anaerobes23P micra facultative anaerobic gram positive bacterium4 These 2 species human oropharynx34 Pulmonary infection A odontoly ticus P micra result aspiration species lungs In article reported case lung abscess respiratory failure immunecompetent patient caused 2 organisms A prompt diagnosis adequate treatment pulmonary actinomycosis important relatively rare disease low mortality rate The computed tomography ﬁndings pulmonary actinomycosis provide limited informa conﬁrmative diagnosis pulmonary tion actinomycosis microscopic examination pus lung biopsy sample25 A case pulmonary actinomycosis periodontal origin Actinomyces naeslundii Actino myces viscosus reported previously6 A case periodon tal embolism Actinomyces species reported speciﬁc species mentioned7 This case highlights potential pathogenic role A odontolyticus periodontal origin risk factor lung infection diseaseassociated pulmonary septic The pulmonary infection P micra rare P micra rarely identiﬁed pure culture This organism usually causes periradicular diseases periodontitis microorganisms4 Poetter et al reported case pleural empyema P micra cultured pleural pus4 In case A odontolyticus identiﬁed pleural ﬂuid culture P micra identiﬁed blood culture Although pulmonary actinomycosis rare difﬁcult diagnose prognosis relatively good properly treated28 There guidelines antibiotics treatment pulmonary actinomycosis P micra infection The recommended therapy infections 4 6 weeks intravenous penicillin followed 6 12 months oral regimen249 In case patient treated intravenous antibiotics 15 days percutaneous drainage treated oral antibiotics months This case highlights potential pathogenic role A odontolyticus P micra immunecompetent patients lung abscess Physicians consider organisms causative pathogens lung abscess acute respiratory failure especially evidence periodontitis exists Author contributions
