hospital diagnosis revised additional staining revealed histiocytic nature spindle cells Unlike ALK positive histiocytosis spindle cells IMT myofibroblastic differentiation The similarities morphology

histiocytic positive CD4 CD68 CD163 ALKpositive In previous case hospital double immunostaining performed cells confirmed positive CD163 ALK leading diagnosis 1 The number ALKpositive histiocytosis cases reported far small number primary cases breast limited including case 1614 Table 1 Five cases localized systemic suggesting presence KIF5BALK fusion gene All patients underwent surgical resection breast lesions patient lesions organs treated ALK inhibitor Due small number reported cases exact prognosis disease unknown However recurrence observed cases When accurately diagnosed
