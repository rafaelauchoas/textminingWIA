VI MALIGNANT UTERINE COMPLICATIONS OF FIBRO MYOMATA OF THE UTERUS By F W N Haultain MD FRCPE Assistant Gynecologist Royal Infirmary Edinburgh The association fibromyomata uterus malignant changes organ subject considerable importance 168 MALIGNANT UTERINE COMPLICATIONS OF FIBROMYOMATA Until recently coincidence considered rare actually thought mere presence fibromyoma prevented development cancer Now hand observers Eichelot assert fibroids predispose malignancy The reason contrary beliefs far seek The wish father thought In earlier days removal fibromyomata dangerous proceeding satisfying physician think patient invalided fibroid subject infinitely dangerous condition cancer Now intrepid gynaecologist glorying success modern surgical technique loves believe fibroids preeminently predispose malignancy exception removed presence symptoms constant menace future welfare individual As usual divergent views mature deliberation tends direct midway extremes experience investigation little doubt conditions malignancy fibromyomata entirely independent origin slightly affect The exception statement said actually depend malignant degeneration fibroid extremely rare occurrence The subject malignancy fibroids considered following standpoints 1st Malignant degeneration fibromyomata 2nd The coincidence carcinoma sarcoma uterine mucosa fibromyomata 3rd Malignant changes cervix supravaginal hysterectomy BY DR F W X HAULTAIN 169 Malignant Degeneration Fibromyomata That fibromyomata secondarily malignant generally admitted means common inferred Authentic thoroughly proved cases sarcomatous change preexisting fibroid probable cases encapsulated sarcomata degenerated fibromyomata The following case shows clinically pathologically main features transition worthy detailed description Miss B age 71 recommended Dr Helm Carlisle suffered great abdominal pain haemorrhage foetid discharge associated rapid abdominal enlargement Menstruation ceased age 52 years previously flow profuse exhausting accompanied considerable abdominal distension presence hard swelling After climacteric swelling subsided excellent health months previous visit On examination uterus enlarged size months pregnancy protruded cervix large rounded mass involving entire posterior wall uterus thinned anterior cervical lip Panhysterectomy performed excellent immediate results disease returned vaginal cicatrix fatal issue months The uterus contain large interstitial growth involving entire posterior wall encapsulated external os Upon miscroscopic examination showed fibromuscular tissue infiltrated numerous large round cells actively proliferating evidently sarcomatous nature In majority cases sarcomatous growth 170 MALIGNANT UTERINE COMPLICATIONS OF FIBROMYOMATA
