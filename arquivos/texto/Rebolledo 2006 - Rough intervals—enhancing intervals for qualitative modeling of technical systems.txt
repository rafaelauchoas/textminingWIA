provided interval based qualitative models particularly probabilistic information behavior available The new concept successfully integrated Situationbased Qualitative Modeling Analysis method It allowed integration vague uncertain process knowledge SQMA models taking advantage rich information hidden human way perceiving describing nature This improved precision compact ness SQMA models
