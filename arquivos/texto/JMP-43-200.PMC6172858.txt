study reported Spitzer et al routine screening chest radiographs significantly beneficial onethird neonates identifying things potential pulmonary problems patients clinical status deteriorated2 The International Commission Radiological Protection ICRP encouraged authorized bodies set diagnostic reference levels DRL best meet specific needs consistent regional national local area apply DRLs determined 3rd quartile distribution mean dosimetric values3 Therefore DRL dose limit guide DRLs essentially act initial standard local radiology audit process identifying situations patient doses unusually high Local reviews undertaken relevant DRLs consistently exceeded appropriate corrective actions taken improve practice avoid unnecessary risk radiation health effects4 A previous study

anticipated benefits diagnostic information obtained6 In radiological diagnostic examination risk generally taken proportional cumulative organ dose The radiation risk radiographs example approximately twice risk single scan irrespective time interval radiographs7 The biological effects low doses 100 mSv ionizing radiation subject debate Risk assessments complicated fact human beings relatively high natural cancer risk 2533 exposed natural background radiation varies populations Even large epidemiological studies provide reliable excess risk factors low doses It necessary use linear nothreshold hypothesis states cancer risk low linear energy transfer doses increases proportionally radiation dose increases extrapolated risks higher doses8 Evidence increased risk mortality cancers excluding leukemia lung cancer reported increasing radiation doses9 Very young children 34 times sensitive ionizing radiation adults8 An increased susceptibility children radiationinduced cancer biologically plausible tissues growing dividing cells prone somatic genetic damage In addition children longer life expectancy oncogenic effects develop9 The ICRP specifically warned use
