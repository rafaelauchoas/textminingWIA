management infertility Severe pelvic pain menorrhagia associated conditions commonly managed intramuscular injections gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist leuprolide acetate Since receiving approval US Food Drug Administration 2018 novel oral gonadotropinreleasing hormone antagonist elagolix increasingly manage endometriosisassociated pain However efficacy elagolix treatment adenomyosis infertility remains uncertain In clinical case infertile patient endometriosis diminished ovarian reserve treatment elagolix effectively controlled severe endometriosisrelated pelvic pain surprisingly

health providers aware elagolix effectively suppress adenomyosis leuprolide acetate particularly infertility patients undergoing treatment assisted reproductive technologies 1 Introduction Endometriosis adenomyosis benign gynecological conditions present unique challenges treatment infertility women reproductive age Both manifest chronic pelvic pain heavy menstrual bleeding significantly impair womens quality life Endometriosis occurs 1015 women reproductive age However affects 70 women chronic pelvic pain incidence high 50 women infertility 12 Adenomyosis uterine form endometriosis defined endo metrial tissue invading 25 mm myometrium 34 It presents unique challenges assisted reproductive technologies ART especially embryo implantation active inflammatory na ture Thus adenomyosis decreases clinical pregnancy rates creases risk early pregnancy loss 5 Adenomyotic lesions proliferate high estrogen state regress estrogen deprivation As theorized ectopic endometrial tissue regress response therapies inhibit ovulation reduce estrogen pro duction 4 This inhibition commonly achieved intramuscular leuprolide acetate longacting gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH agonist suppresses HPG axis leads decreased estrogendriven endometriosis proliferation In turn inhibition leads improvement embryo implantation pregnancy outcomes infertile women adenomyosis undergoing ART treatment 67 In 2018 oral shortacting GnRH antagonist elagolix approved US FDA treatment moderate severe pain associated endometriosis However efficacy treatment infertile women adenomyosis unclear case reports suggesting reduction adenomyomatous lesions 89 This report presents clinical case patient infertility endometriosis received elagolix management pelvic pain

outcomes embryo implantation clinical pregnancy rates live birth rates 7 Conversely elagolix convincingly demonstrated treat endometriosis related pelvic pain heavy menstrual bleeding Along lines preferred medical treatment adenomyosis established medications label Little data exist efficacy GnRH antago nists treating adenomyosis improving infertility 10 With gard elagolix specifically data evaluating effect adenomyosis insufficient clinical scientific evidence use ART There published case reports demonstrating effect GnRH antagonists adenomyosis concern noninfertile women The describes 41yearold patient fundal adeno myoma regressed size 39 cm 27 cm months elagolix 150 mg day 8 The second case reports patient adenomyomatous uterus reduced size 875 cm3 290 cm3 12week course oral GnRH antagonist linzagolix 200 mg day 9 In cases patients reported decreased pelvic pain improved quality life Additionally openlabel pilot study 8 women MRIdiagnosed adenomyosis 12 weeks oncedaily linzagolix 200 mg followed 100 mg daily additional 12 weeks resulted 32 reduction adenomyotic uterine volume p 00057 improved associated symptoms 11 While results encouraging applicable women adenomyosis endometriosisrelated infertility undergoing ART management Additionally overall utility GnRH antagonists treating adeno myosis determined larger randomized studies 12 Of note doubleblind randomized controlled trial performed MuneyyirciDelale et al compared effectiveness ela golix addback therapy placebo reducing heavy menstrual bleeding 786 women uterine fibroids coexisting adeno myosis They compared placebo elagolix significantly reduced bleeding 13 However given participants study fibroids adenomyosis unknown findings generalized women adenomyosis fibroids There evidence suggest GnRH antagonist effective GnRH agonist 1014 days IVF ovarian stimula tion scientific data exist comparing pretreatments endometriosis adenomyosis prior ART Evaluating group infertile women adenomyosis Zhang et al com parison GnRH agonist IVF cycles GnRH antagonist cycles resulted similar clinical pregnancy rates cumulative live birth rates 14 Some speculated given flexibility oral adminis tration GnRH antagonists use linzagolix superior preferable current treatments adenomyosis ART 15 Given understanding new medications setting ART based limited data clear investigation area necessary In conclusion case report demonstrates progression adeno myosis elagolix manage pelvic pain patient endometriosisrelated infertility Leuprolide acetate treatment months resulted regression adenomyosis preparation embryo transfer ART cycle Taken limited data area efficacy elagolix treatment adenomyosis infertility remains uncertain This clinical case raises awareness despite effective pian relief elagolix effectively suppress progression adenomyosis leuprolide acetate particularly women infertility undergoing ART management As hope largescale studies conducted area help elucidate
