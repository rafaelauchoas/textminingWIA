successful implementation currently appropriate task set This interference tasksets suggested causal observed performance costs switch task sequence like AB A B denote different tasks compared task

proposal inhibitory mechanisms reduce activation competing taskset help selection appropriate taskset reduce inter ference Monsell 2003 The present study aimed examining inhibitory processes task
