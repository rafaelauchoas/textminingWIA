Abstract We present rare extramedullary bifocal hyposecretory manifestation lapsed MM mistaken infection We stress importance com plex evaluation including serum urine bone marrow assessment body imaging K E Y W O R D S extramedullary hyposecretory imaging multiple myeloma 1 What new aspect work A rare manifestation multiple myeloma relapse extramedullary bifocal hyposecretory Moreover activity disease behave myeloma different infectious condition 2 What central finding work We stress importance comprehensive examination including mod ern diagnostic tools elucidate diagnosis goes hind routine criteria 3 What specific clinical relevance work The key clinical points following Multiple myeloma manifestation atypical mistaken different condition The approach suspected relapse multiple myeloma rely solely routine monitoring include complex assessment including serum urine tests bone marrow assessment body imaging Extramedullary eloma needs looked appropriate imaging
