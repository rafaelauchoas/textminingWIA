Introduction human engage perform Argumentation scientific reasoning constitutes arguments major component essential intelligence The new ability problems opinions daily lives The way humans argue based simple principle summarized succinctly old saying The word laughs best To let look persons I A countries example mock argument war responsible understand express clarify defend blocking negotiation region principle humans illustrate Example 1 I My government negotiate government government doesnt recognize government A Your government doesnt recognize government The explicit content Is utterance recognize ty As government following commonsense interpretation blocking rule Is government blocks negotiation This establishes negotiation implicit appeal failure As government responsibili Responsibility attribution If actor performs action causes state affairs state affairs actor responsible action justified A uses kind reasoning blocking negotiation Is government doesnt recognize As Is government counterargue responsible government At point arguer claim victory hurting position Consider following continuation arguments I But government terrorist government attribution justifies failure Is government recognize As government Is govern blocking negotiation So represents attack As I clearly word rule appplied As government responsible If exchange stops successfully argued This utterance Thus responsibility ment responsible argument means blocking negotiation The goal paper scientific account basic principle The explore possible word laughs best
