patient outcomes provide effective symptom management22 An intervention symptoms involved symptom cluster effective symptoms cluster For example providing relief patients effective symptoms pain nausea fatigue19 Studies indicate symptom clusters influence severity symptoms childs functional status quality life212324 Statistical Approaches Modeling Symptom Clusters There generally main approaches identifying symptom clusters The method perform statistical analysis based clinical experiences deterministic model The second establish symptom clusters based directly statistical analyses prior assumption relationships symptoms heuristic model2526 In method identifying symptom clusters grounding clinical experiences symptom cluster constituted symptoms considered related based clinical experiences statistical analyses performed In method clusters include symptoms2627 The common example clusters cluster including symptoms nausea vomiting The clusters including symptoms fatigue pain sleeping problems fatigue pain depression common clusters102128 To look relationship symptoms cluster Pearson Spearman correlation performed However method disadvantages selected symptoms During identification relationship selected symptoms correlation analyses relationship symptoms missed Accordingly symptoms included cluster accurately identified2627 Studies relevant symptom clustering recommend wideranging instruments interrogate large number symptoms time27 The second method identify symptom clusters based statistical analyses This method necessitate assumption grounded clinical experience derive symptom cluster2526 It considered symptom clusters constituted objectively method27 This method gives opportunity use instruments interrogate symptoms These instruments measure common symptoms dimensions symptom severity distress caused symptoms Thus instruments measure stated dimensions time measurement2227 There consensus statistical methods performed identification symptom clusters instruments measure multiple symptoms However common methods recently factor analysis cluster analysis22 Factor analysis statistical method investigates relationship variables In studies symptom clusters factor analysis determine common factors explain correlation symptoms In oncology studies preferred identification symptom clusters complex relationships multiple symptoms26 Cluster analysis statistical method focused classification trying similar symptoms cluster separate cluster clusters Frequently agglomerative hierarchical methods utilized Hierarchical methods arrange clusters hierarchy relationships different groups apparent Agglomerative methods begin symptom cluster group symptoms symptoms cluster The results type analysis generally presented treelike diagram called dendrogram An arbitrary cutoff measure association defines final symptom clusters Final clusters derived analysis investigated terms appropriateness clinical sense Cluster analysis guarantee conceptual meaningfulness trigonometric solution262729 AsiaPacific Journal Oncology Nursing Volume 5 Issue 1 JanuaryMarch 2018 53 Erdem Toruner Symptom Clusters Nursing Care Two methods determine symptom clusters children cancer Variable number symptom clusters including different symptoms research use deterministic model heuristic model1013143031 Hockenberry et al method defined symptom cluster previous study10 Later changed method agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis data In secondary data analysis symptom clusters13 The recent studies examined symptom clusters children cancer agglomerative hierarchical methods exploratory factor analysis cluster analysis identify symptom clusters143031 Instruments Symptom Clustering Children Most common instruments measure multiple

identifying effects symptom clusters quality life functional status significant parameters1921 In study Yeh et al derived symptom clusters children cancer examined cluster differed based functional status They indicated children good function reported effects related gastrointestinal irritations pain cluster Furthermore fatigue sleep depression clustered like studies30 Therefore essential nurses understand relationships symptoms larger perspective Pediatric nurses evaluate frequency severity distress physical psychological symptoms children cancer regularly symptom clustering instruments Concurrent symptoms relationships symptoms understood symptom cluster Nurses use symptom cluster interventions prevent concurrent symptoms provide effective symptom management possible single implementation maintain childs daily routine functional status improve quality life Eventually symptom clusters include concurrent related symptoms improve nursing care Figure 1 includes summary symptom clusters nursing care process Conclusion Children undergoing treatment leukemia experience symptoms disease treatment2 Symptom clustering method identify relationship multiple coexisting symptoms2021 It important nurse provides care child leukemia know complex relationship multiple symptoms occur disease process The identification symptom clusters present concurrent correlated symptoms enable nursing care planned physical psychological symptoms child This ensure effective approach planning implementing evaluating Considering symptom clusters evaluation symptom management broader perspective nurses Consequently nurses holistic approach practice providing care child family It seen use symptom clusters children undergoing treatment leukemia cancers limited literature Symptom clusters research children conducted specific diagnosis groups It essential promote symptom clusters nursing care nursing interventions Physical Symptoms Psychological Symptoms Pain vomiting nausea lack appetite sweating coagulation problems fatigue mouth sores constipation Worrying feeling sad nervous feeling irritable Frequency Severity Distress Relationship Concurrent symptoms Symptom Clusters Nursing Interventions Especially Prevent concurrent symptoms Understand complex relationships symptoms Provide successful symptom management possible single implementation Maintain childs
