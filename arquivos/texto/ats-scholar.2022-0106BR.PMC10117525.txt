DISCUSSION ECMO currently outside scope conventional training physicians nurses ECMO low frequency complex patient volume hospitals insufficient train clinicians Therefore training away bedside commonly train new ECMO specialists The study evaluated formal extended ECMO education program contained clinical training Our program recruited multidisciplinary participants country Most education

rotations allowed participants comprehen sive understanding ECMO Eight weeks clinical training guaranteed participants chances bedside learning patients receiving ECMO If participants receive days
