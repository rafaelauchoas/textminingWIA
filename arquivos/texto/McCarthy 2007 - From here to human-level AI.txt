2007 Abstract Humanlevel AI achieved new ideas certainly needed date reliably predictedmaybe ﬁve years maybe ﬁve years Id inclined bet 21st century It surprising humanlevel AI proved difﬁcult progress slowthough important progress The slowness demand exploit discovered led mistakenly redeﬁne AI ways preclude humanlevel AIby relegating humans parts task humanlevel programs In terminology paper amounts settling bounded informatic situation instead general common sense informatic situation Overcoming brittleness present AI systems reaching humanlevel AI requires programs deal common sense informatic situationin phenomena taken account achieving goal ﬁxed advance We discuss reaching humanlevel AI emphasizing logical AI especially emphasizing representation problems information reasoning Ideas reasoning common sense informatic situation include nonmonotonic reasoning approximate concepts formalized contexts introspection 2007 Published Elsevier BV Keywords Humanlevel AI Elaboration tolerance 1 What humanlevel AI The ﬁrst scientiﬁc discussion human level machine intelligence apparently Alan Turing lec ture 35 The notion ampliﬁed goal 34 paper achieve goal Allen Newell Herbert Simon 1954 ﬁrst people start programming computers general intelligence They overoptimistic idea achieve humanlevel intelligence inadequate The General Problem Solver GPS took general problem solving task transforming expression allowed set transformations Many tasks humans humans computers There approaches human level AI presents difﬁculties It isnt question deciding eventually succeed race Email

human intellect works simulate However dont sufﬁcient ability observe understand directly intellects work Understanding human brain imitate function requires theoretical experimental success psy chology neurophysiology1 See 28 beginning information processing approach psychology 2 To extent understand problems achieving goals world presents intelligence write intelligent programs Thats article Much public recognition AI programs little bit AI lot computing This succeeded chess checkers far failed game Go requires identiﬁcation subpositions analyzed separately ﬁrst interaction Human chess players chess programs dont The price greater computation makes necessary affordable chess Computer speed bypasses heuristics save humans enormous computation What problems world present intelligence More narrowly consider problems present human scale robot faced problems humans inclined relegate sufﬁciently intelligent ro bots The physical world robot contains middle sized objects sensory apparatus obtain partial information inadequate fully determine effects future actions Its mental world includes interactions people metainformation information obtain Our approach based common sense informatic situation contrast bounded informatic situation characterizes formal scientiﬁc theories maybe experimental work AI far A formal theory physical sciences deals bounded informatic situation Scientists decide informally advance phenomena account For example celestial mechanics Newtonian gravitational theory account possible additional effects outgassing comet electromagnetic forces exerted solar wind If phenomena considered person new theory Probabilistic fuzzy uncertainties ﬁt bounded informatic necessary set possibilities sample space bounded Most AI formalisms work bounded informatic situation What phenomena account decided person formal theory constructed With restrictions reasoning monotonic systems reach human level ability For machine decide information relevant When bounded informatic appropriate construct choose limited context containing suitable theory predicates functions connect machines inputs outputs appropriate way2 The logical tool bounding informatic situation nonmonotonic reasoning 2 The common sense informatic situation Contention The key reaching humanlevel AI making systems operate successfully common sense informatic situation In general thinking human common sense informatic situation 13 It general bounded informatic situation The known facts incomplete priori limitation facts relevant It decided advance phenomena taken account The consequences actions fully determined The common sense informatic situation necessitates use approximate cepts fully deﬁned use approximate theories involving It requires nonmonotonic reasoning reaching conclusions The common sense informatic situation includes knowledge systems mental state 1 Recent work positron emission tomography identiﬁed areas brain consume glucose person mental arithmetic This knowledge help build AI systems possible observe going areas mental arithmetic 2 The textbook 4 puts way To humanlevel computational intelligence agent decides divide world relationships reason 1176 J McCarthy Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 11741182 A nice example common sense informatic situation illustrated article American Journal Physics years ago It discussed grading answers physics problem The exam problem ﬁnd height building barometer The intended solution measure air pressure building multiply difference ratio density mercury density air However answers offered 1 Drop barometer building measure time hits ground 2 Measure height length shadow barometer measure length shadow building 3 Rappel building barometer measuring rod 4 Lower barometer string till reaches ground measure string 5 Offer barometer janitor building exchange information height 6 Ignore barometer count stories building multiply feet Clearly possible bound advance common sense knowledge world relevant grading problem Grading solutions requires knowledge formalisms physics physical facts earth law falling bodies variation air pressure altitude However case physics knowledge embedded common sense knowledge Thus use Galileos law falling bodies s 1 2 gt 2 needs common sense information buildings shapes roofs Bounded informatic situations obtained nonmonotonically inferring phenomena appear relevant relevant In barometer example student expected infer barometer conventional way measuring air pressure For example reasoning applying circumscription predicate relevant formalism containing metalinguistic information problem assigned physics course Formalizing relevance useful way promises difﬁcult existing relevance logics Common sense facts common sense reasoning necessarily imprecise The imprecision necessitated common sense informatic situation applies programs people Some kinds imprecision represented numerically explored aid Bayesian net works fuzzy logic similar formalisms This addition study approximation numerical analysis physical sciences 3 The use mathematical logic What mathematical logical languages Mathematical logic devised formalize precise facts correct reasoning Its founders Leibniz Boole Frege hoped use common sense facts reasoning realizing imprecision concepts common sense language necessary feature bug The biggest success mathematical logic formalizing purely mathematical theories imprecise concepts unneeded Since common sense informatic situation requires imprecise facts imprecise reasoning use mathematical logic common sense limited success This caused people Others devise extended logical languages extended forms mathematical logic It necessary distinguish mathematical logic particular mathematical logical languages Particular logical languages determined particular choice concepts predicate function symbols represent Failure distinction led people conclude logic inadequate shown particular language inadequate purpose Different concepts different predicate function symbols succeed In words drivein movie critic Grapevine Texas Im surprised I explain stuff The pessimists logic particular set predicates try prove theorem inadequacies expressing common sense3 Since clear humans dont use logic basic internal representation formalism maybe work better AI Researchers trying ﬁnd 1950s havent succeeded getting ready applied common sense informatic situation Maybe eventually succeed However I think problems listed later sections article arise approach humanlevel AI 3 Gödels theorem relevant question decideability characterizing truth J McCarthy Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 11741182 1177 Mathematical logic concerned people ought think people think We use logic basic AI formalism programs reason logically However extend logic extend programs use ways One important extension development modal logic starting 1920s treat modalities like knowledge belief obligation Modalities treated modal logic reifying concepts sentences standard logic My opinion reiﬁcation standard logic powerful work better A second extension formalization nonmonotonic reasoning beginning late 1970swith circum scription default logic variants major proposals Nonmonotonic logic studied pure mathematics application AI problems prominently formalization action causality Several variants major formalisms devised Success far moderate isnt clear greater success obtained changing concepts representation predicate function symbols varying nonmonotonic formalism4 We need distinguish actual use logic Allen Newell 26 27 calls logic level proposed 8 4 Approximate concepts approximate theories Other kinds imprecision fundamental intelligence numerical imprecision Many phenomena world appropriately described terms approximate concepts Although concepts imprecise statements precise truth values We offer examples concept Mount Everest concept welfare chicken The exact pieces rock ice constitute Mount Everest unclear For rocks truth matter Mount Everest Nevertheless true qualiﬁcation Edmund Hillary Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest 1953 John McCarthy set foot The point example possible common solid knowledge structure solid conclusions inferred based foundation built quicksand approximate concepts deﬁnite extensions As chicken clear feeding helps wringing neck harms unclear welfare consists course decade time hatching Is better leading life poultry luxury eventually slaughtered better escaping chicken yard taking chances starvation foxes There truth matter determined careful investigation chickens When concept inherently approximate waste time try precise deﬁnition Indeed different efforts deﬁne concept precisely lead different resultsif Most human common sense knowledge involves approximate concepts reaching humanlevel AI requires satisfactory way representing information involving approximate concepts McCarthy 22 discusses logic A simple approach involve giving necessary conditions sufﬁcient conditions rock Mount Everest try necessary sufﬁcient conditions 5 Nonmonotonic reasoning Common sense reasoning imprecise draws conclusions information Thus common sense reasoning nonmonotonic I details proposals handling nonmonotonic reasoning In particular getting common sense informatic situation bounded informatic situation needs non monotonic reasoning 4 One referee KR96 foolishly arrogantly proposed rejecting paper grounds inadequacy circumscription representing action known 1178 J McCarthy Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 11741182 6 Elaboration tolerance Human abilities common sense informatic situation include called elaboration tolerance ability elaborate statement facts having start Thus begin think problem determining height building form bounded context try solve problem However time facts added precision time barometer fall estimated stop watch possibilities acquiring stop watch McCarthy 21 discusses 20 elaborations Missionaries Cannibals problemmostly informally Lifschitz 6 formalizes 7 Formalization context A extension mathematical logic involves formalizing notion context 16 Notice theories human communication study theory context people discuss outside If computers facility work logic outer logical language needs names contexts sentences giving relations way entering context Clearly humanlevel AI requires reasoning context Humanlevel AI requires ability transcend outermost context far Besides 17 discussed 20 Further work includes 1 2 8 Reasoning eventsespecially actions Reasoning actions major AI activity paper discuss peoples current formalisms concentrating instead long range problem reaching human level capability We regard actions particular kinds events propose subsuming reasoning actions heading reasoning events Most reasoning events concerned determining effects explicitly given sequence actions single actor Within framework problems studied The frame problem concerns having state change event occurs The qualiﬁcation problem concerns having state preconditions action event The point limit set preconditions jump conclusion unstated fulﬁlled evidence contrary For example wearing clothes precondition airline travel travel agent tell customer sure wear clothes The ramiﬁcation problem concerns treat sideeffects events principal effect mentioned event description Each involves elaboration tolerance adding descriptions effects additional events having change descriptions events described When I wrote applications circumscription formalizing common sense 11 I hoped simple abnormality theory sufﬁce That didnt work I tried I think common nonmonotonic reasoning mechanism work Costello 3 argues simple abnormality theories expressive power elaborate nonmonotonic formalisms proposed Human level intelligence requires reasoning strategies action action programs It requires sidering multiple actors concurrent events continuous events Clearly long way Some points discussed 19 concerns elaborating simple narrative involving actors 9 Introspection selfawareness People limited ability observe mental processes For intellectual tasks introspection irrelevant However relevant evaluating ones thinking time Humanlevel AI J McCarthy Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 11741182 1179 require introspective ability In fact programs humans examine source compiled form reason current values variables program McCarthy 20 discusses That robots need introspection argued discussed 20 10 Heuristics The largest qualitative gap human performance performance area heuristics gap disguised applications millionsfold speed advantage computers The general purpose theorem proving programs run slowly special purpose programs specialized heuristics I think problem lies present inability programs domain problem dependent heuristic advice In 7 I advertised Advice Taker express heuristics declaratively For 40 years I know Recently Joseﬁna SierraSantibanez important theoretical experimental progress controlling planning declaratively expressed heuristics The work reported 32 33

discusses coloring maps colors terms modifying Prolog program map coloring It simply exempliﬁed terms coloring map United States Note California CA neighborsArizona AZ Nevada NV Oregon OR Therefore postpone coloring CA resulting reduced map colored Then ﬁnd color CA different color AZ NV OR The process reducing map continued CA removed AZ neighbors Eventually completely reduced map state

Maybe human level AI discussed high school texts programming science I dont want objections article 12 Conclusion Between humanlevel intelligence lie problems They summarized succeeding common sense

starting See 21 nonmonotonic reasoning Perhaps new systems needed maybe question circumscribing right formulas varying right predicates functions See 12 contexts objects This subject beginning See references Section 7 introspection AI systems need examine internal states See 20 action The present puzzles formalizing action admit uniform solution A new version situation cal culus discussed 23 I doubt humanlevel intelligent program needs structures corresponding entities listed A generally intelligent logical program probably needs monotonic nonmonotonic reasoning mechanisms plus mechanisms entering leaving contexts The rest handled particular functions predicates To extent problems faced explicitly people working neural nets connec tionist systems The systems I know primitive problems arise However ambitious systems inhabit common sense informatic situation They elaboration tolerant require kind mental model consequences actions Many ﬁnd dismayingly large list tasks accomplished order reach humanlevel logical intelligence Perhaps fewer powerful ideas simplify list Others claim evolves intelligence life straightforward build Maybe advocates approach long arent close So race It scientiﬁcally satisfying understand human level artiﬁcial intelligence logically achieve computerized evolutionary process produced intelligent incomprehensible result In fact logical approach worth pursuing intellectually lazier evolutionary approach won race 121 What humanity humanlevel AI Here science ﬁction science ﬁctionalizes science literary objectives social agendas These mainly involved assuming humanlike personalities including good bad behavior suffering persecution andor psychological problems like humans There need AI systems humanlike personalities designed excite fear sympathy When humanlevel AI available unlikely monopoly group government Many individuals groups use advance goals As early 1970 wanted international regulation AI This bad idea remain bad idea long little understanding form humanlevel AI Id like robot servant I access humanlevel Id ask help understanding consequences humanity policies AI Acknowledgements In writing 1996 version article I got useful
