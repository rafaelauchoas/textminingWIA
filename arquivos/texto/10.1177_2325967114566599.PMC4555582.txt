While crosspin fixation suspensory fixation aperture fixation distance point fixation intraarticular portion graft significantly suspensory fixation leading increased graft motion Our hypothesis increased failure rate follows Since femoral tunnel placed 2 10 oclock position anteromedial tech nique graft significantly closer lateral wall drilled transtibial Even impingement noted intraoperatively graft situated milli meters wall As result graft motion tunnel widening associated suspensory fixation movement graft position lateral wall impin gement exacerbated lateral wall
