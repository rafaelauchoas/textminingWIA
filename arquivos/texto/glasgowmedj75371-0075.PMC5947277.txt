Diphtheria conferred AntitoxinThere unquestionably doubt minds medical men immunising power antitoxin Literature certainly vague important question long time safety assured doses For purpose answering questions Dr F Gordon Morrill Boston Medical Surgical Journal reports results obtained Childrens Hospital Boston Eighteen patients received immunising doses thousand injections antitoxin given The results experience extending years leads author strongly doubt soundness conclusions reached Kassowitz years ago He positive able confer immunity promptly injecting exposed cases adequate dose antitoxic serum The evidence presented certainly bear belief observations great care conscientiously recorded reported From evidence Dr Morill concludes perfectly justified believing 1 That immunity given case matter thorough exposure diphtheria conferred days injection small dose 100250 units serum provided given twentyfours hours previous actual infection 2 That large dose 250 units child 2 years 500 units 8 years confer safety weeksor little conservative daysunder similar conditions 3 That harm result treatment vast majority cases sick children probably case healthy child provided serum present standard purity In eighteen cases reported far bad results injections concerned ones like dangerous symptoms appeared boy splenic leucocythemia nephritis In instance antitoxin caused distinct increase albuminuria dropsy In case clinical symptoms present urinary analysis corresponded closely injections produced unpleasant effects Of thousand injections given exceptions aside occasional urticaria far rare insignificant transitory albuminuria worth noting followed Very rarely antitoxin omitted postponed matter sick patient In instance severe cerebrospinal meningitis 396 Abstract
