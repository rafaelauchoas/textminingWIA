certain important cases constraint region occupied piece liquid Hausdorff continuous overly restrictive There main cases kind Case 1 Suppose solid objects O 1 O 2 ﬂat surfaces meet suppose surfaces im mersed liquid pushed Fig 14 Then liquid ﬁlls gap surface moment objects meet point gap disappears At moment gap disappears region occupied liquid discontinuity Hausdorff metric equal radius largest
