MBoC PERSPECTIVE How design chalk talkthe million dollar sales pitch Erik Lee Snapp Janelia Research Campus Ashburn VA 20147 ABSTRACT Each faculty recruiting season postdocs ask What chalk talk The chalk talk thingsa sales pitch teaching demonstration barrage questions description future research program The chalk talk arguably important component faculty search interview Yet postdocs grad students receive training practice giving chalk talk In following essay Ill cover basics chalk talk design preparation Monitoring Editor Keith G Kozminski University Virginia Received Apr 8 2019 Accepted Apr 23 2019 The chalk talk faculty candidates opportunity hisher proposed research program The candidate stands dry erase board markers room 1020 faculty members hour Candidates 510 minutes present research pro gram plan committee ask technical questions practical questions insulting questions The candidates task answer questions grace pres sure convince faculty members accept herhim col league himher million dollars startup pack age Considering point time devote developing chalk talk If youre going ask million dollars better sophisticated polished sales pitch However describing prepare chalk talk analogous explaining ride bike One mechanics steps bike riding considerable precision riding bike intuitive takes practice bike upright Therefore youll need perspectives Nearly postdocs ably critique research programs Yet postdocs fall prey mistakes easily identify pro grams This analogous phenomenon alien voices sound We hear clearly speak surprising hear different ones voice sounds cording Its issue science Were close projects sound rich melodic ears perceive research description nasal squeakiness eludes Unfortunately writing ideas initially lead recognition flaws

essential feedback people considerable experience chalk talks The organization style chalk talks rarely taught people offer guid ance Faculty members help distinguish mechanistic questions descriptive proposals identify overly ambitious goals evaluate attractiveness research proposal CREATING A RESEARCH VISION A chalk talk describes candidates research vision heshe hopes achieve 610 years Some search committees expect description grant application National Institutes Health R01 Prepare discuss The committee wants know candidate clear goals defined outcomes What problem solved What new lab known How advanced field What success look like If successful know andor able A research vision candidates approach resolving signifi knowledge gap field Some people research vision moon shot That program successful accomplished Theres clear outcome defines terms success In case 1960s moon shot unambiguous goal send manned mission land moon collect data better understand moon Although components play role getting moon goal vague At point understanding achieved When theres plotted trajectory When theres rocket ship A vision needs anticipate probable answers How data look What model favor If vision merely proposes mapquantitate collect data committee know question answered The highlevel problem The component research vision big question mystery solved It high level broadly Volume 30 June 15 2019 1575 understandable scientists outside ones field interesting Here examples How cell recognize destroy incorrectly folded proteins How immune turn response pathogen vanquished The knowledge gap Within big question specific problem studied Why study problem What current state field What knowledge gap A knowledge gap barrier progress field Knowledge gaps mechanistic problems How questions What questions For example asks What proteins Z pathway answer openended list proteins lacking context Alternatively How proteins X Y regulate Z pathway mechanistic enables predic tions example protein X contains predicted kinase domain Y consensus phosphorylation sequence sites proteins Y Z reported bind pulldown assays The proteins question steps upstream question difficult predict outcomes A researcher seek identify proteins interact Z Yet candidates identified validated direction potential success research program remain murky Significance Significant necessarily mean cure disease equivalent landing moon Rather significance impact successful research program field Does research vision result powerful new mechanistic model enable new major questions posed open new therapeutic avenue disease create new field These examples significance Approach aims How knowledge gap solved Typically information broken aims Aims provide mechanistic insights help resolve overarching knowledge gap The scope aim varies depending grant aim 10year research vision aim For grant aims typically performed people 15 years research vision aim equivalent grant Be careful overly ambitious A common mistake aim 10year search program To avoid problem consider satisfactorily answering question entails What milestones need achieved How long running What kinds controls needed What competing hypotheses need tested Get feedback senior faculty members Aims short clear titles include following formation What question What prediction How tested Are innovative tools techniques help resolve question Are alternative approaches What anticipated outcomes How results interpreted What model incorrect What payoff successful completion aim Will results aim support main hypothesis Below example aim R01 grant kindly shared Mengxi Jiang wwwniaidnihgovsitesdefaultfilesR01_Jiang _Sample_Applicationpdf Determine viral DNA triggers activate DNA Damage Response DDR polyomavirus infection The current view polyomavirus field viral oncogenes activate DDR In contrast results suggest DDR activation dependent viral DNA synthesis We hypothesize replicating viral DNA serves major trigger DDR activation infection In aim identify viral DNA structures recognized host cells damage signals induce DDR activation This aim contains key elements The sentences set competing models The sentence articulates hypothesis Finally types data collected data support hypothesis described During chalk talk candidate structures isolated host cell recognizes DDR activation measured There introduction field believes oncogene model candidates prelimi nary data argue model Additionally candidate expected outcomes outcomes mean hypothesis larger knowledge gap candidate hypothesis supported It easily 1015 uninterrupted minutes Do surprised upset aims This completely normal Discovery driven goals A common error science equating ability collect data automatic understanding data resolving knowledge gap Yet rarely true For example screen long list molecules genes unclear utility Data screens rarely predictable Data collection screens depend entirely Which outcomes relevant What screen returns dozens hits This screens proposed Novel screens subcomponents larger aim clear questions pre dictions Its attractive performed preliminary screen validated hits Knowing outcomes components enable formation hypotheses models predictions I appreciate frustrating need data sell project funded thats nature grantfunded research Although data need collected answer questions actual answering articulation questions frequently missing grants chalk talks Poor aims lists techniques data collected The goal data The goal test models hypotheses resolve conflicts deter mechanisms The data need predictable outcomes interpreted If likely outcomes described search committee member unable evaluate research vision Clarity details For chalk talks challenge learning research vision diverse naive audience There experts know candidates particular field plenty people Most people probably use terminology jargon Minimize jargon jargon absolutely necessary explain term Ten minutes short time present overview The background succinct Ive encountered postdocs determined Annual Reviews version background project They insist understand project hour background This true possible chalk talk format Some details obviously important understanding science terribly good telling engaging narrative Consider narrative childrens fairy tales For example needs know 1 Cinderella glass slipper criti cal prince able identify 2 carriage turn unusable form transportationa 1576 E L Snapp Molecular Biology Cell pumpkinat midnight However shoe size specific music pieces played ball species pumpkin irrelevant details advancing story The true research vision Learn communicate research vision salient details If committee member wants know technical tails let ask question In instances helpful rephrase questions andor add introduction rest committee members understand answer 3 Practice times people outside lab field If understand engaged presentation good sign Practice chalk talk format typical ques tions committee It important practice faculty members served search committees There sub stitute If possible fulllength practices 1 hour constructive feedback What worked What How clearer engaging TRANSLATING A RESEARCH VISION INTO THE CHALK TALK FORMAT The chalk talk expands research vision 30minute pre sentation composed overview expansion aims The overview 510minute sales pitch able understand enthusiastically support In addition components research vision candidate explain heshe best person research Does candidate innovative tools novel data set unique exper tise andor novel hypothesis Part motivation research candidate ability execute proposal resourcestechnology currently exists solve problem Creating coherent unified story model vital Engineer logical progression linking aim main question il lustrated model highlights aims solve question After completing overview presenter dive aim Prepare able discuss subaims main aims Again focus ques tions predicted outcomes hypotheses tested antici pating technical challenges outcomes contrary hypothesis The committee wants candidates ability plan adapt There questions easily occupy 30 minutes allotted time In fact candidate needs steer presentation Committee members unintentionally intentionally derail chalk talk argument obscure details Part candidates task answer questions keeping talk moving forward Importantly search committee needs excited research program How good colleague Why provide million dollars execute research vision An easy follow proposal compelling problem clear outcomes increase enthusiasm committee PRACTICE Engineering chalk talk takes weeks effort Lastminute preparation readily apparent sound like million dollar sales pitch Start preparing advance invitations interviews 1 Design easytodraw interpret figures diagrams illus trate vision Practice drawing writing form easily visible room Do limit 2D whiteboard Consider creating visual aids better illus trate point Ive seen 3D printed sculptures effectively illustrate concepts Similarly maybe useful hand leg motions sounds help people better understand idea I remember applicant worked molecular motors illustrated motor motions marching lifting legs arms amusing exaggerated manner 2 Perfect story delivery Practice delivering talk second nature COMMON CHALK TALK QUESTIONS Many chalk talk questions involve clarifying details ground experiments defending interpretation suggesting alternative approaches Additional questions include following What dream experiment anticipated result What projectthesis titles graduate students How incorporate undergraduates research program If working noncommercial technology novel microscope build maintain technology What approach work outcome radically different prediction What accomplished proposed goals start lab If key collaborator collabora tor unavailable Who potentially collaborating department How compete established labs field How research program differ postdoctoral mentors program What new lab Checklist day chalk talk 1 Bring fresh set erasable markers 2 Bring eat snack chalk talk 3 Maintain energy level 4 Bring beverage The host offer 5 Thank attendees time 6 Minimize time facing whiteboard Engage com mittee 7 Most importantly enthusiastic This research pro gram You proud excited getting opportunity realize vision ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
