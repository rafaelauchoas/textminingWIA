Editorial Gut Liver Vol 12 No 1 January 2018 pp 12 Understanding Gastric Cancer Risk Factors We Need Close Gap Joo Ha Hwang Division Gastroenterology Department Medicine University Washington School Medicine Seattle WA USA See Knowledge Gaps Physicians Caring Multiethnic Populations Increased Gastric Cancer Risk Shailja C Shah et al page 38 Vol 12 No 1 2018 Gastric cancer fifth common malignancy world wide incidence gastric cancer United States relatively low 73 100000 2017 accounting 17 new cancer cases United States1 Given low incidence medical providers United States including gastroenterologists fully understand risk factors gastric cancer realize high risk populations United States benefit screening gastric cancer In issue Gut Liver Shah et al2 publish report evaluates knowledge gaps physicians topic risk factors gastric cancer The authors performed internetbased survey physicians pri mary care providers gastroenterologist New York City included knowledge assessment gastric cancer risk factors followed clinical vignettes This study highlights current gaps knowledge physicians theoretically knowledgeable risk factors gastric cancer population care highest population immigrants high incidence areas In nutshell study demonstrates need educate phy sicians risk factors gastric cancer Primary care physicians need education risk factors ethnic ity Helicobacter pylori infection patients referred gastric cancer screening Gastroenterologists need education risk factors including ethnicity H pylori infection significance gastric intestinal metaplasia surveyed As paper demon strates vignettes gastroenterologists realize gastric intestinal metaplasia patient high incidence region endoscopic surveillance There issues remain unresolved comes gastric cancer screening United States Although Japan Korea demonstrated gastric cancer screening costeffective mortality benefit issues adequately addressed highrisk populations United States With lack data benefits gastric cancer screening highrisk populations United States weak recommendations exist single US medi cal society American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy suggesting screening EGD gastric cancer new US immi grants highrisk regions world Korea Japan China Russia South America especially family history gastric cancer firstdegree relative3 In addition American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ASGE suggests surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD patients gastric intestinal metaplasia thought increased risk developing gastric cancer ethnicity family history4 As physicians United States need remember United States continues significant immigrant population area high incidence gastric cancer Gastric cancer particular disease occurs dispropor tionately higher certain immigrant populations high incidence regions world mentioned previously This probably significant unaddressed healthcare disparities United States5 Another fact highlights disparity guidelines esophageal cancer screening Barretts esophagus established United States al incidence esophageal cancer lower gastric cancer United States 16940 vs 28000 2017 Correspondence Joo

screening United States EGD highrisk patients followed surveillance patients H pylori infection atrophic gastritis andor intestinal metaplasia algorithm suggestion based extensive review literature incorporating recommendations ASGE8 Additional data efficacy costeffectiveness algorithm proposed gastric cancer screen ing needed implementation insurance coverage screening test Fortunately diagnosing early gastric cancer increasing United States partially creasing developing expertise endoscopic sub mucosal dissection United States With increasing terest diagnosing early gastric cancer provides opportunity educate gastroenterologist United States significant healthcare disparity The study Shah et al2 provides important data help guide specific topics physicians require education
