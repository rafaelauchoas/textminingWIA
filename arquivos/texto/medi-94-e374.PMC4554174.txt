number judgments individual physicians minimizing learning bias Second information reported paramedics comorbidities previous hospitalizations information vital parameters influenced physicians clinical impression interfered physicians rating impression However study physicians instructed record impression earliest time point possible Third perform interrater reliability testing scoring
