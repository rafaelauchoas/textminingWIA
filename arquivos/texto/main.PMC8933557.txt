report 1 Introduction Introduction importance Hydatid disease caused zoonotic parasite Echinococcus granulosus presents cysts commonly liver lungs A hepatopleural fistula considered complications surgery remains mainstay treatment A simultaneous invasive thoracic abdominal access routinely needed accompanied increased morbidity mortality Case presentation In case report present innovative invasive nonclassical approach Clinical discussion We introduce successful transabdominal transdiaphragmatic laparoscopic technique management hepatopulmonary fistula secondary hydatid disease liver Conclusion Compared classical method new surgical approach hepatopulmonary fistula paves way minimally invasive surgeries manage complicated hydatid disease lower mortality morbidity faster recovery shorter hospital stay The work reported line SCARE 2020 criteria Hydatid disease considered remarkable health problem world wide endemic developing underdeveloped countries Middle East Africa It caused zoonotic parasite Echinococcus granulosus 1 presenting cysts commonly liver 5080 lungs 1040 2 Several complications hy datid disease liver develop formation hepatopleural fistula Hepatopleural fistula considered reported complications includes formation fistula liver parenchyma pleural space 3 Surgery remains mainstay treatment hydatid disease especially established cases hepatopleural fistula 4 It traditionally transthoracic approach addition abdominal access However associated high morbidity mortality especially devel oping countries modest expertise field 1 Recently invasive surgical approaches advocated management hepatopleural fistula 5 Here report successful transabdominal transdiaphragmatic laparoscopic approach manage liver hydatid cyst hepatopleural fistula yielding
