Most aneurysms incidentally discovered routine imaging studies This report describes case unusual presentation TAAs Case Presentation A 37yearold male presented emergency department jaundice shortness breath abdominal swelling lower limb edema worsened previous month The patient worked diagnosed ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 69 cm associated severe aortic insufficiency heart failure Conclusion TAA lifethreatening condition indistinct signs symptoms A high index suspicion early implementation radiological studies prerequisites reach diagnosis Keywords ascending aortic aneurysm thoracic aortic aneurysm clinical presentation jaundice transthoracic echocardiography Background Thoracic aortic aneurysms silent14 Their diagnosis usually follows pathway radiological study performed different reason aneurysm discovered coincidentally5 The etiology aneurysmal forma tion incompletely understood6 Most aortic aneurysms caused degenera tive infectious genetic conditions weaken aortic wall6 Symptomatic aortic aneurysms manifest chest pain discomfort new cardiac murmur drastically heart failure aortic dissection rupture6 It estimated 21 patients suffering acute aortic syndromes die reaching hospital2 Jaundice mainly caused choledocholithiasis carcinoma head pancreas biliary strictures pancreatitis sclerosing cholangitis7 Jaundice rare presentation abdominal aneurysms obstruction biliary tree7 CT MRI confirms diagnosis aortic aneurysms6 Intervention surgery percutaneous technology indicated size aneurysm reaches threshold risk developing complications
