rule Finally present concluding remarks ML Bonet et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 606618 609 2 The MaxSAT resolution rule soundness In MaxSAT need repeated clauses Therefore use multisets clauses instead sets For instance multiset b b clause repeated minimum unsatisﬁed clauses MaxSAT resolution like classical resolution based unique inference rule In contrast resolution rule premises MaxSAT resolution rule removed multiset applying rule Moreover apart classical conclusion variable cut conclude additional clauses contain premises subclause Deﬁnition 1 The MaxSAT resolution rule deﬁned follows x a1 x b1 bt a1 b1 bt x a1 b1 x a1 b1 b2 x a1 b1 bt1 bt x b1 bt a1 x b1 bt a1 a2 x b1 bt a1 as1 This inference rule applied multisets clauses replaces premises rule conclusions We rule cuts variable x The tautologies concluded rule removed resulting multiset Similarly repeated literals clause collapsed Deﬁnition 2 We write C cid5 D multiset clauses D obtained multiset C applying Max SAT resolution rule ﬁnitely times We write C cid5x D sequence applications cuts variable x The MaxSAT resolution rule conclude clauses classical resolution rule Notice number conclusions rule number literals premises However premises share literals conclusions tautologies removed In particular x A x A cid5 A Moreover study completeness rule need cut conclusions rule Finally size worstcase proof set clauses similar size classical resolution Notice instance rule depends clauses premise cut variable like resolution order literals Notice like classical resolution rule concludes new clause containing variable x clause tautology Example 3 The MaxSAT resolution rule removes clauses inference step Therefore simulate classical resolution clause needs like example Fig 1 left However case

MaxSAT resolution proof different It difﬁcult adapt classical resolution proof MaxSAT resolution proof open question possible increasing substantially size proof 610 ML Bonet et al Artiﬁcial

number unsatisﬁed clauses truth assignment Proof For assignment I prove number clauses I falsiﬁes premises inference rule equal number clauses falsiﬁes conclusions Let I assignment I falsify premises satisﬁes x x Suppose I satisﬁes x a1 x b1 bt Then I falsiﬁes bj s sets x true Now suppose I satisﬁes literal a1 Say ai ﬁrst literal Then I falsiﬁes x b1 bt a1 ai1 ai satisﬁes set conclusions Suppose I falsiﬁes ai s Then falsiﬁes a1 b1 bt satisﬁes conclusions If I satisﬁes second premise ﬁrst similar argument I falsiﬁes conclusion Finally suppose I satisﬁes premises Suppose I sets x true Then j bj true I satisﬁes conclusions bj x The argument works similarly I falsifying x cid2 3 Saturated multisets clauses In section deﬁne saturated multisets clauses This deﬁnition based classical notion sets clauses closed restricted kind inference particular sets clauses closed cuts variable In classical resolution given set clauses variable saturate set cutting variable exhaustively obtaining superset given clauses If repeat process variables complete resolution algorithm obtain clause original set unsatisﬁable Our completeness proof based idea However notice classical saturation set wrt variable unique MaxSAT Remark 8 In fact superset original set Moreover general saturate set wrt variable wrt variable obtain set saturated wrt variables What ﬁrst saturate respect variable x This way create multisets variables One clauses dont contain variable x clauses contain x We saturate respect following variable multiset clauses doesnt contain ﬁrst variable x We rest variables Also saturation procedure keeps good property given multiset clauses saturated wrt variable x exists assignment satisfying clauses containing x extended assigning x satisfy clauses Lemma 9 Deﬁnition 5 A multiset

cutting x ﬁnitely times Trivially previous deﬁnition multiset clauses C saturated wrt x possible application inference rule cutting x introduces clauses containing x tautologies eliminated ML Bonet et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 606618 611 We assign function P 0 1n 0 1 clause function P 0 1n N multiset clauses follows Deﬁnition 6 For clause C x1 xs xs1 xst deﬁne characteristic function PCcid7x 1 x1 1 xs xs1 xst For multiset clauses C C1 Cm deﬁne characteristic function PC cid2 m i1 PCi cid7x Notice assignment I PCI number clauses C falsiﬁed I Also soundness rule step MaxSAT resolution rule replaces multiset clauses characteristic function Before stating proving following lemma let recall usual order relation functions f cid4 g x f x cid4 gx f g x f x cid4 gx x f x gx Since functions ﬁnite domain order relation range wellfounded order relation functions wellfounded Lemma 7 For multiset clauses C variable x exists multiset Ccid3 Ccid3 saturation C wrt x Moreover multiset Ccid3 computed applying inference rule pair clauses x A x B restriction A B tautology ordering literals apply inference rule longer restriction Proof We proceed applying nondeterministically inference rule cutting x obtain saturated multiset We need prove process terminates ﬁnitely inference steps exist inﬁnite sequence C C0 cid5 C1 cid5 inference step cut variable x sets Ci saturated At step divide Ci multisets Ei clauses contain x Di clauses contain variable x positive negative form When apply inference rule replace clauses Di multiset clauses A contain x Therefore obtain distinct multiset Ci1 Di1 Ei1 Ei1 Ei A Since A tautology characteristic function PA PA PCi PEi1 constant zero function Then PCi1 PDi1 PDi Therefore characteristic function multiset clauses containing x strictly decreases inference step Since order relation characteristic functions wellfounded proves perform inﬁnitely inference steps cid2 PA obtain PDi1 PDi PEi Remark 8 Although multiset clauses saturable saturation unique For instance multiset b c possibles saturations wrt variable multiset b b c b c b c multiset c b c b c b c Another difference respect classical resolution saturate set clauses simultaneously wrt variables saturating wrt wrt For instance saturate c b c wrt obtain b c b c This possible saturation original set If saturate multiset wrt b obtain original set c b c Therefore possible saturate multiset clauses wrt b simultaneously Lemma 9 Let C saturated multiset clauses wrt x Let Ccid3 subset clauses C containing x Then assignment I satisfying Ccid3 assigning x extended assignment satisfying C Proof We extend I satisfy C In fact need set value x If x unique polarity C Ccid3 extension trivial x true x occurs positively x false If clause form x A x A assignment I satisﬁes A choice value x work Otherwise assume clause x A similarly x A I sets A false We set x true All clauses form x B satisﬁed For clauses form x B C saturated exists literal l l A l B This ensures I falsiﬁes A I l false I satisﬁes B cid2 612 ML Bonet et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 606618 4 Completeness MaxSAT resolution Now prove main result paper completeness MaxSAT
