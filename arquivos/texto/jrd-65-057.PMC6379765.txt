In present study facts revealed effect postovulatory oocyte aging meiosis II First established NCAs frequently induced early embryos derived vitro aged oocytes NCAs errors sister chromatid segregation

fertilization preimplantation development appear 12 h latest oocyte collection These results appeared reflect NCA frequencies aged oocytes embryos derived aged oocytes described later In study approximately 40 chromosome spreads analyzed 8cell embryos derived 12 h aged oocytes exhibited aneuploidy Fig 2 Additionally aneuploidy detected 12 h aged oocytes completed second meiosis occurred frequency observed 8cell embryos These data suggested aneuploidy occurred frequently embryos derived vitro aged oocytes early development aneuploidies originated sister chromatid segregation errors meiosis II The major factor causing chromosomal aneuploidy oocytes abnormality chromosome separation meiosis 28 29 Many reports suggested failed chromosome distribution caused alterations spindle shape misalignment chromosomes equatorial plane MII oocytes 11 31 32 Normal spindles barrelshaped including chromosomes accurately aligned equator mouse oocytes 8 It indicated spindle normally shaped tends elongate progress aging vitro As shown Fig 3 aged oocytes obtained present study elongated spindles consistent results previous reports 30 32 Furthermore aged oocytes obscured spindles misaligned chromosomes spindle fibers connected kinetochore In aged oocytes microtubules gradually lost spindle greatest loss central spindle area near chromosome 8 From facts appeared obscure spindles disrupted microtubules caused tubulin depolymerization The poor connection spindle fiber chromosome kinetochore caused microtubule disruption generates disproportionate tension chromatids In second meiosis spindle microtubules equally pull sister kinetochores opposite poles tension generated sister chromatids connection stabilizes 33 34 If microtubules pull sister kinetochores wrong direction connection usually corrected sister chromatids accurately distributed By activating checkpoint signal blocking advance anaphase stage SAC ensures time correct connection errors spindle fiber kinetochore 35 When SAC respond correctly improper connection spindle fibers kinetochore frequency aneuploidy aged oocytes increased 22 23 28 36 Thus important note abnormalities localization checkpoint signal molecule aged MII oocytes Fig 5 MAD2 binds MAD1 kinetochore plays role monitoring connection spindle fibers kinetochores 3638 MAD2 usually appear connections spindle fibers kinetochores occur normally However MII oocytes treated nocodazole inhibitor microtubule polymerization MAD2 detected near centromere Fig 4 In study revealed aged oocytes MAD2 localization chromosome

chromosome distribution error 34 40 On hand research murine porcine oocytes reported expression level MAD2 gradually decreased oocytes aged 36 41 42 Our data showed significant difference expression

However based combination MAD2 localization data expression levels possible discern potential agerelated dysfunction checkpoint MAD2 monitors kinetochoremicrotubule connection Previous reports provided distinct evidence dete rioration sister chromatid cohesion cause agerelated aneuploidy 2125 37 The cohesin complex serves adhesion molecule connecting sister chromatids chromosome segregation regulated SAC REC8 meiosisspecific subunit cohesin separase recognition site specifically cleaved separase 22 Thus expression cohesin REC8 essential retain proper sister chromatid connections terminal phase chromosome segregation It known Rec8deficient mice loss synapsis homologous chromosomes poor cohesion sister chromatids 21 Even wildtype mice shown REC8 gradually reduce chromosome mice age 2123 25 43 Chiang et al 23 reported sister kinetochores MI MII oocytes old mice tightly connected They shown oocytes poor connec tions sister kinetochores REC8 expression levels decreased sister chromatid cohesion weakened In human oocytes agedependent deterioration cohesin REC8 recognized strongly suggesting association premature separation sister chromatids PSSC factor aneuploidy 43 Although previous

activated oocytes depending aging time significantly change aged oocytes activation compared aged oocytes activation The expression level cohesin REC8 usually decreases promptly activation Securin
