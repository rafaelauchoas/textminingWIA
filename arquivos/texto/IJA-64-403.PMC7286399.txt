pain assessment performed regularly reduce adverse outcomes postoperative pain10 However present study 12 patient reported pain assessed reported majority verbalized assessed 17 twice 485 shift Inadequate assessment postoperative pain patients present study In 100 experienced postoperative pain 24h surgery average mean pain 24h postoperatively 49 15 mean worst pain score 24h surgery 76 15 Furthermore incidence moderatetosevere level average pain experienced 24h surgery significantly high 825 This signifies acute postoperative pain undertreated present study adverse effects discomfort delayed wound healing increased risk cardiovascular pulmonary complications decreased gastrointestinal activity prolonged hospital stay poor patient satisfaction12 In present study postoperative pain mainly treated NSAIDs 59 combination opioids 30 sole use opioids low 5 Opioids liberally West easy accessibility better training health care professionals12 Opioids effective management acute pain restrictively countries like India rigid regulations13 fear addiction14 poor training healthcare professionals15 use intervention negligible Surprisingly nonpharmacological pain management present study majority patients reported nurses use pain nonpharmacological management 805 health care professional encouraged use nonpharmacological pain relieving methods 810 These results consistent study

management acute postoperative pain P 004 fear effect addiction poor pain management training health care professionals1521 Surprisingly despite fact majority patients experienced moderate severe level acute postoperative pain significant number satisfied overall pain treatment 69 response physician 81 nurses 62 pain complaints This fact patients expect pain inevitable phenomenon surgery Such attitude characterized low expectations postoperative pain relief encourage persistence poor standards analgesia Patients satisfied suffer moderatetosevere pain wait relatively longer time pain medication16 This issue handled patient education adequate reporting postoperative pain active patient participation pain management Patients involvement pain management study assessed 0 10 scale mean score involvement surprisingly low 09 17 Similar findings reported McTier et al 201322 While Schwenkglenks et al 201423 conducted extensive multinational study concluded patients actively involved pain treatment report better pain control higher levels satisfaction Studies reported constant monitoring patients acts preventive strategy minimize postoperative complication related pain2425 CONCLUSION The incidence moderatetosevere level acute postoperative pain alarmingly high pain assessment significantly inadequate Acute postoperative pain significant interference ADLs sleep emotions
