Sanjay Agrawal Department Anaesthesiology Critical Care All India Institute Medical Sciences Rishikesh Uttarakhand India ABSTRACT Background Aims Subclavian vein SCV cannulation performed supraclavicular SC infraclavicular IC longaxis approach ultrasound guidance USG However relative efficacy remains debatable The aim study compare approaches terms safety ease success rate record incidence complications Methods We studied 90 adult patients distributed groups 45 Data time taken venous puncture time required inserting catheter total number attempts incidence guidewire misplacement mechanical complications compared Students ttest quantitative data Chisquare test qualitative value Results Mean puncture time significantly lesser group SC IC Pvalue 0001 Mean catheter insertion time taken significantly group SC IC Pvalue 0003 The attempt rate higher group SC IC P 0013 Guidewire misplacement seen IC group P 0001 No pneumothorax haemothorax arterial puncture noted study groups Conclusion We conclude rightsided SCV cannulation USG long axis SC approach superior IC approach terms overall ease cannulation It associated relatively shorter procedure time higher success rate attempt lesser incidence guidewire misplacement complications It considered alternative approach IC approach patients requiring central line insertion Key words Catheterisation complications subclavian vein ultrasound longterm venous access especially Central vein catheter CVC insertion necessary sick patients patients undergoing major operation Longterm intravenous support subclavian vein SCV preferred restriction neck mobility lesser frequency thrombosis1 The blind landmark technique SCV cannulation associated certain lifethreatening complications haemopneumothorax 2 catheter malposition 93 subclavian arterial puncture 052 So recent studies advocate use ultrasound guidance USG internal jugular vein IJV SCV cannulation CVC direct vision USG needs lesser number
