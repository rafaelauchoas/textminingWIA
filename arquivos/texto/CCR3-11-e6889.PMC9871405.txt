Many studies suggest link dysautonomia COVID 19 infection Dysautonomia term refers improper functioning sympathetic parasympa thetic nervous systems include limited symptoms labile blood pressures orthostatic hypotension impotence bladder dysfunction alter ations bowel functions12 Notably COVID 19 linked orthostatic intolerance syndromes including postural hypotension tachycardia3 Orthostatic hypotension defined decrease blood pressure 20 mmHg systolic 10 mmHg diastolic postural changes supine sitting andor sitting stand ing position4 Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS defined orthostatic symptoms absence hypotension increase heart rate 30 bpm standing 30 s 40 bpm age 12 195 It presumed symptoms related immune mediated disruption autonomic nervous resulting long term
