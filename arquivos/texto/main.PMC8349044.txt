mucoepidermoid carcinoma PMEC extremely rare tumor respiratory The clinical presentation PMEC variable nonspecific including cough hemoptysis wheezing mimic symptoms pneumonia asthma Here present case PMEC 12yearold male diagnosed treated asthma 2 years The patient presented symptoms respiratory failure respond steroids bronchodilator medications Chest computed tomography CT scans revealed endotracheal tumor The patient underwent complete tumor resection signs recurrence 6 months treatment Primary pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma originates glands line tracheobronchial tree 1 represents approxi mately 0102 primary lung tumors 2 PMEC affects younger patients compared common types lung cancer 3 Due tumor location patients typically present symptoms associated bronchial obstruction atelectasis 3 The tumors classified lowgrade highgrade based histo pathological results 3 Complete surgical resection remains pri mary therapy PMEC 4 This case emphasizes roles imaging histopathology diagnosis exclusion diseases avoidance misdiagnosis mistreatment 2 Case report A 12yearold male patient diagnosed asthma 2 years prior presented increasing shortness breath wheezing cough The patient history allergies The patient previ ously hospitalized times symptoms treated bronchodilators steroids symptoms improve appeared increase severity A blood test revealed increased neutrophil cell count 13 GL Creactive protein level 25 mgL A chest computed tomography CT scan performed revealed intratracheal mass This mass wellcircumscribed homogeneous enhancement Fig 1 The lung parenchyma normal mediastinal lymph nodes observed Bronchoscopy tumor resection indicated The histological results demonstrated tumor cells included epidermoid mucous intermediate cells keratinization Fig 2 The final diagnosis lowgrade PMEC tumor negative surgical margins The patient treated adjuvant therapy After surgery symptoms breathless ness wheezing disappeared Chest CT scans 6 months surgery showed signs recurrence Fig 1 Corresponding author Department Radiology Pham Ngoc Thach University Medicine Ho Chi Minh City Viet Nam Corresponding author Email addresses bsnguyenminhducpnteduvn NM

The extracellular spaces formed tumor cells contain mucoid substance 9 Highgrade tumors increased nuclear pleomorphism mitotic activity cellular necrosis reduced mucoid substances vessels compared lowgrade PMEC 9 Surgical resection primary treatment option patients PMEC 11 Multiple surgical approaches utilized including lo bectomy segmental resection endoscopic removal depending location extension tumor 11 Adjuvant therapy indicated cases lowgrade PMEC complete resection 4 No evidence currently supports efficacy chemotherapy radio therapy highgrade PMEC epidermal growth factor receptor EGFRtargeted therapy suggested unresectable highgrade PMEC 12 Lowgrade PMEC associated good prognosis 5year survival rate 95 highgrade PMEC associated worse prognosis 310 The patient article child presented respiratory tract obstruction symptoms misdiagnosed asthma long time After complete tumor resection histological results revealed lowgrade PMEC patient indicated receive adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy The symptoms res piratory obstruction completely solved tumor removal Fig 2 Hematoxylin eosin stain 100 revealed tumor contained epidermoid mucous intermediate cells 4 Conclusion 3 Discussion Lung cancer rare children Smoking asbestos exposure appear risk factors PMEC 5 PMEC affects male female individuals equally primarily located trachea bronchus 1 Only 5 PMEC cases classified highgrade majority 95 classified lowgrade 6 Lowgrade tumors occur young patients highgrade tumors likely observed older patients 7 The chest radiography consolidation atelectasis solitary lung nodule mass chest Xray appear normal case small endobronchial tumor airway obstruction 8 Chest CT scans typically endobronchial mass bronchial dilatation air trapping obstructive pneumonia atelectasis 24 Wang et al 9 reported lowgrade PMEC located central bronchial trachea smooth welldefined margins oval lobular shape markedly ho mogeneously enhancing highgrade PMEC tends peripheral illdefined margins lobular heterogeneous reduced enhancement Highgrade PMEC difficult differentiate bronchial carcinoid tumors hypervascularity tumor CT images 6 Bronchoscopy commonly define localization obtain biopsy definitive diagnosis Macroscopically PMEC cells include mucous epidermoid intermediate cells lacking keratinization Children present PMEC rare symptoms similar lung diseases leading delayed diagnosis Chest CT scans help determine cause exclude differential di agnoses asthma pneumonia Most PMEC cases good prognosis timely diagnosis treatment improve overall
