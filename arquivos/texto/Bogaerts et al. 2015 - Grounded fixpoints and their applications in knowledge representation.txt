Strictly grounded We x L strictly grounded O y L y x O y x y The intuition concepts similar easy explain assume elements L sets facts kind relation subset relation sets In case intersection union sets Intuitively set facts x strictly grounded built ground O Such sets built stages Facts derived later stages depend earlier stages This means x stratiﬁed internal structure If remove multiple strata x
