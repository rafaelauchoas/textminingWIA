consider loss generality pure equilibrium a1 b1 c1 player 1 wins In following pure equilibrium semistrict player s strictly prefers equilibrium action actions given players play equilibrium actions In singlewinner games player winner pure equilibrium We ﬁrst s semistrict player 1 win action proﬁle a2 b1 c1 exist nonpure equilibrium For consider strategy proﬁle s1 a1 s1 2 uniform mixture player 2s actions b1 b2 strategy proﬁle s2 a1 b1 s2 3 uniform mixture actions c1 c2 player 3 Since player 1 win a2 b1 c1 incentive deviate s1 s2 wins a2 b2 c1 a2 b1 c2 Consequently player 3 win a1 b2 c2 order s1 equilibrium Analogously s2 equilibrium player 2 win action proﬁle a1 b2 c2 contradicting assumption game singlewinner game Thus existence semistrict pure equilibrium implies nonpure equilibrium Now assume s semistrict When action proﬁles B a2 b1 c1 a1 b2 c1 a1 b1 c2 pure equilibrium yields nonpure equilibrium pure equilibria differ action single player combined inﬁnitely mixed equilibria For B contain pure equilibria exactly player proﬁle B deviates proﬁle C a2 b2 c1 a2 b1 c2 a1 b2 c2 game singlewinner semistrict Moreover player 1 player 2 wins a2 b2 c1 player 2 player 3 game s a1 b2 c2 player 1 player 3 a2 b1 c2 This implies facts First action proﬁle s3 a2 b2 c2 pure equilibrium player deviate s3 proﬁle C Second player wins s3 strictly prefers equilibrium outcome corresponding action proﬁle C implying s3 semistrict The observation semistrict equilibrium yields nonpure equilibrium completes proof As iii recall payoff player obtains equilibrium security level Thus positive
