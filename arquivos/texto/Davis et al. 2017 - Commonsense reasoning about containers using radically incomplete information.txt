containers A container wide range materials rigid materials paper cloth animal body parts combinations The requirement material maintain shape suﬃcient degree holes open contents escape Under circumstances container boundary liquid instance insect trapped region formed water basin upsidedown cup A container wide range shapes precise geometric conditions different kinds containers given section 61 The material contents container constrained In case closed container constraint material contents penetrate absorbed material container carry water paper bag carry light cardboard box contents destroy material container gorilla balsa wood cage Using open container requires additionally contents ﬂy 8 Using container holes requires contents ﬁt squeeze holes Those constraints In case closed container material contents practically practically kind dynamics For instance infer eel remain inside closed ﬁsh tank knowing mechanisms eels use swim motions possible eels A container serve

briefcase thermos bottle hiding contents inspection envelope ensuring objects enter exit speciﬁc portals teakettle In cases necessary kinds material physical effects ﬁt portals pass material container For instance petcarrying case holes allow air display case allows light dust There primary kinds physical principles involved cases First matter continuously contents teleported container Star Trek constraints apply Second contents externality kept dust pass material container Third constraints deformations possible shapes container content Fourth case upright open container gravity prevents contents escaping Simple natural examples commonsense physical reasoning reveal number important characteristics 9 First human reasoners use partial spatial information For example consider text There beetle crawling inside cup Wendy trapped putting hand cup carried cup outside dumped beetle lawn A reader understands cup hand formed closed container beetle Wendy removed hand cup dumping beetle Thus qualitative spatial knowledge cups hands beetles suﬃces interpreting text reader require geometry speciﬁed precisely Second human reasoners infer material conﬁned closed container vague idea physics material container idea material contents For example text understood reader know beetle insect worm small jellyﬁsh Third human reasoners predict qualitative behavior ignore irrelevant complex details
