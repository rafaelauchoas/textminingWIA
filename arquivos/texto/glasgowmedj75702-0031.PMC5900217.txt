Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy 119 SOME POINTS IN TRACHEOTOMY By DAVID FOULIS MD Glasgow Read Southern Medical Society 13th January 1881 When friend Dr Carr requested read paper occurred points nection operation tracheotomy fairly discussed Society The members familiar description given books present doubt performed operation repeatedly It superfluous attempt recapitulate modus operandi place permitted refer difficulties I met invite expression opinion points improvement appears possible In course practice I occasion open air tube twentythree times varied diseases I restrict remarks cases trachea seat incision leave account cases opening purposely cricoid cartilage This leaves fourteen cases tracheotomy First fatality operation I case death traced operation Six cases diphtheria laryngeal phthisis acute inflammation swelling mucous mem brane lining larynx extreme stenosis owing old standing laryngeal inflammation com plete closure larynx intralaryngeal papillomata child 2J years old Four cases diphtheria died disease varying periods breathing relieved death rendered peaceful Another case recovered immediate danger diphtheritic attack far permit removal tube closure wound sank months operation cardiac syncope probably paralytic effects disease The cases diphtheria perfect recovery tube removed fortnight The case laryngeal phthisis tided immediate danger suffocation ended fatally year operation extension disease The cases acute inflammation swelling mucous membrane larynx excellent recoveries able dispense tube month operation The 120 Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy cases chronic thickening elderly people rallied tracheotomy tube continued worn One succumbed diabetes months tracheotomy alive comfort regards breathing Lastly little boy larynx occupied intralaryngeal growths strong tube year operation I able remove number papillomata larynx fair prospect able dispense tube soon I thought right mention briefly cases owing kindness medical friends sent course I bring forward statistics small number cases belief novelty importance remarks events certain basis observation The point I draw attention size tube different ages This particularly important operation young children beneath attention adults The youngest patient list female child aged 6 months days I saw caught cold The symptoms slight certain dyspnoea set gradually increased extent alarm attendants Active treatment calomel tartar emetic local bloodletting failing relief I asked perform tracheotomy When I saw child 10 pm 11th November 1879 agonizing state dyspnoea skin pale clammy lips pale blue tint inspiration eyebrows rose forehead wrinkled supraclavicular lateral costal regions sank noisy inspiration expiration indicated advanced There membrane stenosis larynx fauces suspicion diphtheria diagnosis simple acute laryngitis appeared clear No time lost child fast exhausted Dr Lothian influence chloro form I cut trachea At early age trachea small soft tube easily distinguishable finger delicate rings larynx soft yielding I selected resistant point air tube guidenamely cricoid ring gave clear clue position upper end trachea Exposing I divided rings course isthmus thyroid gland Then arose Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy 121 doubt propriety putting smallest tracheal tube I able procure Some observations published measurements M Marc Sef taught diameter trachea birth 4 mm 5 mm months birth size altered Now smallest tube measured 5 mm external diameter point This completely filled trachea I thought cause erosion tube remain time I tented introduction smaller inner tube diameter 4 mm soon possible I tube silversmith outside diameter 4 mm This new tube Fig 1 equal diameter 01 solid silver plain pattern At suggestion patients father inner tube project little order facilitate removal cleaning loops hooks omitted I delighted tube Fig 1 easily worked nurse mother patient presented difficulty The diameter inner tube small was3 mmgave ample room respiration recovery child went uninterruptedly Thirtytwo days operation tube finally removed small wound allowed heal Unfortunately days wound healed baby caught cold pneumonia set days died operation fairly claimed successful In March 1880 case cf simple acute laryngitis female child ret 17 months excessive dyspnoea occurred practice Dr John Wilson asked We decided tracheotomy I performed way case incision passing isthmus thyroid gland The 4 mm tube patient excellent recovery ample breathing space given 3 mm lumen inner tube Following idea carefully adapting size tube individual case I set silver tubes graduated according measurements trachea different ages able select hesitation tube sure fit individual I birth case birth onwards adult age onwards case unusually interesting kind come notice propriety tracheotomy See Paper Dr Miller British Medical Journal I7tli Nov 1877 t See Lancet 13th July 1878 page 58 K No 2 Vol XV 122 Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy early age seriously discussed This case newly born male child succumbed laryngismus I Diam 4 mm patients 18 months age II Diam 6 mm 18 months 2 years III Diam 8 mm 2 10years IV Diam 10mm 10to 20 years V Diam 12 mm largemales Full size outlines tubes V profile view largest tube plate c placed knobs check inner tube permit grasped D shows lower end Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy 123 hours birth Every sort sedative treatment tried failed question tracheotomy raised negatived But bearing view facts children parents previously succumbed laryngismus shortly birth postmortem examination child I attended failed reveal disease abnormality larynx agreed event delivery followed laryngismus child apparently severe measure tracheotomy shirked parents given approval The success operation child set 6 months detailed leads think favourable result got newly bora lhe curve 01 tubes wide order avoid ulceration anterior wall trachea follows use ordinary overcurved tubes These tubes sold W B Hilliard Sons 65 Renfield Street Another interesting performing tracheotomy exact seat election opening windpipe In books tradition handed informing windpipe opened isthmus thyroid gland hemorrhage alluded event dreaded isthmus cut But best authorities Erichsen Bryant advising leave isthmus possible cut scruple necessary And difficult understand isthmus middle line bloodvessels tongue perineum middle line devoid vessels capillary size Hyrtl failed inject thyroid trom isthmus true thyroid arteries ramifying outside capsule thyroid body send small branches trachea anastomose opposite vessels outside isthmus belong In cases especially young children people short necks space cricoid isthmus small tube got dislodging isthmus incising cricoid matter fact I believe isthmus cut unawares children But fear isthmus young experienced surgeons imbued mistakes I called twice postmortem examina tions children dying diphtheria socalled British Medical Journal op cit 124 Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy high operation surgeons certainly called inexperienced In cases tube pushed larynx base epiglottis gone pouch Morgagni On hand going low come dangers The plexus thyroid veins occasional thyroidea ima innominate trouble bulky thymus children dangerous cut comes way It occurred tracheotomies carefully dissecting parts number bodies ages injected uninjected select isthmus safest seat incision To I impelled watching results cutting cricoid cartil age It answer cut cricoid lor spring ring cricoid tube worn constant irritation unfelt steadily leading perichondritis necrosis parts cartilage Twice I tried obviate removing piece cricoid cases intended wear tube permanently proved successful But merely splitting cricoid result good tube worn week In case female set 34 acute infraglottic oedema care Dr Sloan I performed low operation I profuse haemorrhage thyroid plexus veins I resolved higher incised isthmus best results In cases I cut isthmus knife reason satisfied easy access trachea absence haemorrhage operation Any haemor rhage met air tube small arterial vessels readily secured ligature pressure forceps gushing blood large swollen veins thyroid plexus avoided The trachea near surface useful guide firm resistant ring cricoid upper end incision young children especially considerable value The incision skin reach level cricothyroid membrane point half way supra sternal notch dissecting deeper wise use pairs dissecting forceps held operator assistant tissue cut steadily held sides Dr FoulisSome Points Tracheotomy 125 cut Vessels secured appear Keeping middle line isthmus cut trachea exposed bleeding stopped incised aid hook steady In inserting tube point dissecting forceps placed cut trachea tube pushed blades open trachea tube advances No complicated instruments needed split tubes A tenotomy knife artery compressors sharp hook pairs dissecting forceps necessary instruments The tube treatment easy No steaming needed If single layer dry gauze loosely thrown face neck air kept warm moist purposes It good thing patient chill fog playing open tracheotomy wound happens steam blown hot kettle air patient I prefer patient near draughts abundance fresh air tent blankets bed One I mention explanation belonging operative procedure It remarked I word croup applying cases I avoided purposely appears word croup applicable symptom disease pathological condition Croup far I discover means hoarse cough difficulty respiration symptom caused variety pathological ditions I preferred state opinion disease case It resemble use word cough symptom 01 diseases talk pneumonia bronchitis c c cause cough talk diphtheria acute simple laryngitis c c rise croup That distinct disease word croup fairly limited I believe postmortem table according experience reading resolves recognised pathological conditions air tube It useful word clinical sense word cough
