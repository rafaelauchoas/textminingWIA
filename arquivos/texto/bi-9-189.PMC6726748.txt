behavioral inclination utility body relation dominant hemisphere brain The current investigation assessed handedness chewing preference evaluated food textures Methods Nineteen young healthy volunteers chewed hard walnut soft cake foods surface electromyography recording masseter muscles The chews food types determined compared dominant hand Results Results indicated lateralities

Laterality chewing named masticatory preference individuals prefer chew right What new More half individuals lateralities chewing preference handedness When laterality assessed chewing cycles hard

handchew preference food texture probably located cortex It mentioned P values correlation occurrences chewing preference handedness insignificant experiment chews hard food showed marginal significance Chewing frequently wear teeth masticatory muscles tempromandibular joint Therefore determining preferred chewing dentistry beneficent preparation dental prosthetics dentures regard dental examinations22 30 For determining preferred chewing basic dentistry examination history dentists initially question dominant hand observing chew suggested earlier31 inconsistent valid matter
