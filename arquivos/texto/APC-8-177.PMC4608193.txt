EDITORIAL Universal heart coverage children heart disease India Raman Krishna Kumar Department Pediatric Cardiology Amrita Institute Medical Sciences Research Center Kochi Kerala India INTRODUCTION On August 7 2004 hundreds children suffering heart problems parents arrived Ambedkar Bhavan Lower Tank Bund Hyderabad Friday following assurance social activist seek help Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy ensure children got free treatment A 12yearold boy congenital heart defect CHD attended rally died moments rally taken This sparked widespread public outrage state1 A week later Chief Minister state Y S Rajasekhara Reddy publically expressed desire cover families poverty line proposed universal health insurance scheme lowest possible premium He specifically mentioned scheme provide surgeries children suffering heart ailments2 It widely acknowledged bestknown state sponsored public insurance program India Aarogyasri Scheme triggered particular event The Aarogyasri Scheme spelt strong mandate cover health needs poorest Notwithstanding shortcomings Aarogyasri Scheme model universal health coverage states India nation whole3 Universal heart coverage UHC defined existence legal

dedicated pediatric cardiac programs slow develop India8 As 2015 estimated 50 centers India capability infant newborn openheart surgery minimum annual caseload 200 operations The majority forprofit institutions fewer 10 government sector While shortfall actual number centers excess 900 equally important consideration distribution pediatric heart programs Over 90 pediatric heart programs located western half country West KanpurChennai line Many large states pediatric heart program There programs entire northeastern region Figure 1 It important recognize pediatric heart programs need develop large health care ecosystem fraction children heart disease expect receive comprehensive care todays times8 The purpose editorial explore pediatric heart care included national effort universal health coverage I start summarizing situation pediatric heart care country list specific challenges comes attempting provide coverage single child heart disease India This followed attempt draft roadmap inclusion pediatric heart care universal health coverage agenda THE BURDEN OF PEDIATRIC HEART DISEASE The burden pediatric heart disease India likely largest nations world simply fact children born India Congenital heart disease Two recent surveys birth provided basis estimating burden congenital heart disease CHD India910 Using larger recently published study estimated approximately 100000 babies born year major critical CHD These CHDs include list condition need addressed early 1st year life Recognizing fact majority born CHD receive timely treatment overall burden children adults unoperated CHD likely considerable India Rheumatic heart disease The recent nationwide surveys Jaivigyan Mission Mode JVM Project provide estimates 11000 clinical RHD1112 Because JVM project include developed parts country burden likely underestimated Even burden RHD India likely 2 million substantial proportion affected individuals children adolescents12 Other pediatric heart disease idiopathic

network primary secondary level pediatric caregivers effective referral transportation systems15 Clustering programs metros allow efficiency foster unhealthy competition Unfortunately exactly happened Most programs western half India clustered large metropolitan cities They largely cater relatively affluent sections society resulting ridiculous situation competition programs patients face massive shortfall overall coverage While costs care reach Indian families centers destination increasing number children countries affordable comparison highincome nations These disturbing contradictions simple reflection fact health care India organized accordance societal needs Very existing pediatric heart centers India considered truly comprehensive prevailing western standards Almost programs working capacity face shortfall human material resources limitations infrastructure8 Most programs forced share resources busy adult cardiac programs economically viable The deficiencies nursing intensive care physicians dedicated pediatric heart surgeons capability perform infant newborn cardiac surgery16 There lack ability provide timely diagnosis referral general awareness magnitude problem primary health care professionals resulting late presentation untimely death While RHD affects older children managed centers perform infant newborn heart operations advanced care surgery catheter intervention RHD expensive Children affected RHD typically marginalized sections society little access heart programs reasonable quality ensure predictably good outcomes12 THE ROAD AHEAD TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVER FOR PEDIATRIC HEART DISEASE Infrastructures building capacity human resources The massive shortfall resources available pediatric heart care needs understood stakeholders especially policy planners As long shortfall prevails announcements universal coverage RBSK scheme considered aspirational statements It necessary develop new pediatric programs geographically distributed accordance regional needs It understood pediatric heart surface priority infant mortality readily preventable causes declines Thus regions relatively low infant mortality rate IMR 20 likely perceive need pediatric heart centers first17 It necessary prioritize regions development new pediatric heart programs In regions high IMR strong focus pediatric heart care misplaced public health priorities The important element building pediatric heart programs human resources New centers need manned trained pediatric cardiac surgeons pediatric cardiologists anesthesiologists intensivists nurses perfusion technologists It vital develop select centers academic centers excellence dedicated training programs research facilities These centers vital enable local capacity building Traditionally responsibility providing training shouldered government selected charitable institutions In government academic medical institutions India care children heart disease regularly perform infant newborn heart surgery pediatric cardiac surgery pediatric cardiology largely function subsidiary respective adult cardiac service This arrangement severely curtailed growth specialty come way establishment specialized training programs needed care children heart disease A handful institutions outside government sector initiated training programs pediatric cardiology Training opportunities pediatric cardiac surgeons extremely limited dedicated training programs pediatric cardiac intensive care The following action items building capacity pediatric heart care deserve consideration 1 There need bring key stakeholders include representatives Pediatric Cardiac Society India Medical Council India National Board Examinations Ministry Health including

microeconomics congenital heart surgery India Amrita Institute Medical Sciences Cochin Kerala Baseline followup data 644 consecutive children admitted CHD surgery collected prospectively parents questionnaires semistructured interview schedule Most families belonged upper middle 430 lower middle 357 socioeconomic class Only 39 families form health insurance The median expense admission

significantly predicted higher costs One families reported overwhelming high financial stress admission period surgery Approximately half families borrowed money followup period surgery It likely poorest adequately represented study18 These results clearly suggest universal coverage pediatric heart needs supported public insurance schemes Private institutions need partner government providing UHC manner similar Aarogyasri model The total costs pediatric heart care substantial clear government generate necessary resources It entirely clear annual fund requirement If government undertakes pay promised minister health RBSK document sustainable In regions deficiencies basic maternal child health services substantial resource allocation expensive infant heart surgery justified There key consideration It simply realistic sustainable UHC cover forms pediatric heart disease This especially true congenital defects It needs understood stakeholders CHD includes extremely diverse group conditions Some require treatment fixed single operation require operations lifelong issues correction The extreme diversity resource utilization makes hard come simplified recommendation For example 3stage surgery hypoplastic left heart considerable longterm uncertainty consume lot resources simple cath laboratory procedure large duct good Both lifesaving procedures major differences return investment The likelihood unanticipated costs especially high pediatric heart surgery Intensive care longer expected uncertainty need integrated model calculate reimbursement procedures It necessary recognize availability public insurance fixed reimbursement policy hospitals inappropriately shift focus simple relatively benign heart defects Hospitals prefer restrictive patent arterial ducts relatively small moderate atrial septal defects restrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defects VSDs Some defects left absence public insurance In case priority relatively expensive situation infant large VSD pneumonia stands gain early corrective surgery Given considerations UHC CHD prioritized The framework prioritizing treatment likely complex involve number considerations Two fundamental considerations dictate CHD care prioritized Firstly defect likely impact childs survival wellbeing Secondly likely longterm outcome initial correction defect Most agree major CHDs corrected single operation catheter procedure receive higher priority conditions requiring multiple operations Figure 2 Staged single ventricle palliations uncertain longterm outcome heterotaxy hypoplastic left heart syndrome receive lowest priority Figure 2 attempt classify congenital heart operations based expected longterm outcomes For catheter interventions procedures wide acceptance
