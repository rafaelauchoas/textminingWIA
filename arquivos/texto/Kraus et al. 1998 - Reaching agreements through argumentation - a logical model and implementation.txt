argumentution taken granted Cooperation planned cooperation communication form exchange messages dialogue Arguments change negotiating selfinterested cooperative There different arguments intentions Irrespective argument evaluate argument decide change intentions actions agents try pursue goals achieved utterances aim context agents change recipient agent consequently agents actions listener Within agent change intentions intentions imagine For example mobile robots Mars built maximize utility RI requests R2 dig certain mineral R refuses RI responds threat dig I break antenna RI faced task evaluating threat Several considerations taken account threat bounded RIS credibility intact forth R1 different approach R2 refuses dig respond reward dig today I help equipment promise tomorrow Here R2 needs evaluate promise future reward R2 antenna important bringing essential agreement Argumentation In environment agents situations exchanged messages Argumentation called agents ability

correct model recipient agent refining evaluation arguments later By observing scenarios argumentation persuadee arguments willingness reactions planning knowledge In paper develop formal logic forms
