Challenges Fueling Complexities TB Diagnosis TBHIV Comorbidity Tanzania IHV experience Abubakar Maghimbi MD Mtebe Majigo MD Vincent Mashinji MD George Loy MD Sekela Mwakyusa MD Institute Human Virology University Maryland School Medicine TZ Background Tanzania population 449 million classified 22 high burden countries tuberculosis TB The country houses 5972 health facilities majority urban areas rural areas limited access TB diagnostic services The TB notification rate cases 2011 153100000 people 59100000 smear positive Nevertheless 2013 National TB prevalence survey revealed prevalence bacteriological confirmed TB 354100000 rural areas affected The findings signify TB reported TB continues major driver mortality HIV patients reported facilities supported IHV highest mortality HIV project 20 died TB treatment 73 died symptoms TB Challenges IHVs program reports low rate TB HIV patients By June 2013 20 districts treated 35502 HIV patients 1 diagnosed TB half 4 districts TB intervention project The result likely insufficient diagnostic services In areas patients travel 100km access services More refined diagnostic techniques increase sensitivity like LED Microscopy molecular technology sputum culture insufficient poses particular challenges HIVAIDS patients TB detection activities primarily remained health facility based endeavors minimal community involvement These circumstances provide optimal environment increased TB case detection hinders TB control efforts Interventions IHV implements WHO funded TB program Tanzania support active intensified case
