mainly consideration spinal stability1 preservation neurological function controversy recurrence nerve sheath tumors7 For locally invasive benign tumors complete resection recommended risk recurrence complete removal tumor In contrast incomplete resection adopted scholars tumor grows lumbar spine89 consideration removal tumor sacrifice nerve roots corresponding segment They believe nerve roots invaded tumor exist adherent cases10 remove nerve root removing tumors avoid causing neurological deficits believe patients neurological deficits belong conditions nerve contusions Some scholars think tumors completely removed avoid damage nerves spinal cord2 small percentage patients require secondary surgery tumor growth longterm followup Even literature1112 recurrence rate low mean occur Therefore doctors fully inform patients families prepared WJCC httpswwwwjgnetcom 11454 December 26 2021 Volume 9 Issue 36 Zhou Y et al Giant schwannoma thoracic vertebra A case report Figure 6 Nine months postoperative review internal fixation place tumor recurrence AC aspects multiple surgeries facing type disease For example surgeries difficult challenging try remove entire tumor completely single surgery incomplete resection cases tend increase chances recurrence13 For cases giant schwannoma thoracic vertebra bone destruction tumor invasion T5 T6 seen imaging tumor destruction vertebral bodies extremely considerably affected stability spine In case possible remove completely tumor surgery single posterior approach Thus joint operation method treat disease radical removal tumor invaded vertebral tissue Vertebrae T5 T6 excised posterior fixation long segment pedicle screw performed titanium mesh filling artificial vertebral body implantation Since destruction spinal stability type surgery devastating requirement reconstruction significantly higher patients degeneration trauma To prevent recurrence disease avoid risk physical injury economic burden patients families tumor removed thoroughly possible radical resection long segment posterior fixation performed try restore stability spine14 Since blood supply tumor surface capsule relatively rich blood supply tumor mainly concentrated input output nerve bundle15 special attention given avoid destroying capsule surgery intractable bleeding occur We suggest giant schwannomas perform tumor angioembol ization surgery reduce avoid large intraoperative bleeding Postoperative patients rest 3 mo wear neck chest braces perform moderate ground activities avoid fatigue conditions CONCLUSION Giant invasive spinal schwannomas rare lesions local aggressiveness expansion directions lead bone destruction tissue adhesion Therefore surgical planning particularly important This case proves removal giant thoracic schwannomas feasible onestage surgery excision diseased tissue standard complete possible The surgical treatment schwannomas likely good outcome low rate recurrence good prognosis malignant changes
