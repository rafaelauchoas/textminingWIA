statement assertable given particular state world Interestingly case assertability inherently bipolar phenomenon manifests distinction propositions convention deem deﬁnitely assertable convention classify incorrect dishonest assert Parikh 27 observes Certain sentences assertible sense assert cases sentences nonassertible sense reproach But intermediate kind sentences allow use For example consider witness court law describing suspect short Depending actual height suspect statement deemed clearly true clearly false case witness accused perjury However intermediate height range doubt differing opinions concerning use description short deemed deﬁnitely inappropriate witness viewed committing perjury In words certain height values suspect acceptable assert statement suspect short statement viewed absolutely true Clearly natural connection bipolar aspect assertability idea truthgaps borderline cases outlined If statement θ absolutely true judgment course dependent state world linguistic convention deﬁnes relevant concepts θ deﬁnitely assertable On hand provided θ absolutely false θ deemed acceptable assert The bipolarity assertability special case Dubois Prade 7 refer symmetric bivariate unipolarity judgments according distinct evaluations unipolar scales distinct evaluations assertability sentence negation In current context strong weak evaluation criterion corresponds deﬁnite assertability acceptable assertability As examples type bipolarity natural duality evaluation criteria proposition deﬁnitely assertable acceptable assert negation The adequate representation epistemic uncertainty central importance effective model belief Typically think uncertainty arising insuﬃcient information state world However presence vagueness semantic uncertainty having partial knowledge language conventions For example consider proposition Ethel short Here agent certain knowledge Ethels height uncertain truth proposition uncertainty conventions governing deﬁnition concept short Such uncertainty naturally arise distributed manner language learnt population communicating agents Semantic uncertainty occurs conjunction lack knowledge concerning underlying

logic The ﬁrst threevalued logics additional truthvalue included underlying truthmodel order represent borderline cases A fully truthfunctional calculus deﬁned truthvalues T t b f t denotes absolutely true b denotes borderline f denotes absolutely false Different logics characterised different threevalued truthtables different connectives Well known examples threevalued logics include Lukasiewicz logic 26 Kleenes weak strong logics 16 For example Table 1 shows truthtables connectives negation conjunction disjunction Kleenes strong logic By referring middle truthvalue borderline consciously adopted somewhat nonstandard terminology Both Lukasiewicz Kleene use terminology suggestive epistemic interpretation b corresponding possibly true unknown1 This assume underlying binary truthmodel partial incomplete knowledge However view problematic highlighted Dubois 6 threevalued logics provide adequate model ignorance partial knowledge For example uncertainty concerning binary truthvalue proposition p contradiction p p known false false binary valuations However Kleenes strong logic Table 1 p middle truthvalue p p In contrast epistemic view interested application threevalued logic model truthgaps propositions involving vague concepts From perspective proposition known borderline For example given absolute certainty Ethels height certain proposition p Ethel tall borderline case The intermediate truthvalue p results inherent ﬂexibility concept tall result lack knowledge underlying binary truthmodel Indeed perspective underlying binary truthmodel truth valuations vague propositions inherently threevalued A second model truthgaps supervaluationism proposed Fine 10 Williamson 44 exposi tion2 In approach assumed vague concepts different admissible precise interpretations referred precisiﬁcations For example concept tall admit range admissible threshold values height deﬁning different precisiﬁcation concept The simplest formulation supervaluationism

particular interpretation J Lawry Y Tang Artiﬁcial Intelligence 191192 2012 2041 23 Borderline cases sentences supertrue superfalse Notice unlike valued logic supervaluationism preserves classical tautologies contradictions equivalences For example proposition p negation p borderline cases p p p p supertrue superfalse respectively Furthermore propositional logic sentences classically equivalent supertrue superfalse borderline The relationship supervaluationism models partial incomplete knowledge straight forward case threevalued logic In sense clearly underlying binary truthmodel supervaluations deﬁned terms sets classical valuations Indeed sets valuations proposed way representing incomplete knowledge agents beliefs An example model Boolean twovalued possibility theory 93 necessity possibility sentence decided basis respectively direct consequence consistent set sentences K representing agents incomplete beliefs world In context K characterised set valuations sentence K true sentence necessarily true true valuation possibly true true valuations However supervaluationism sets valuations completely different way capture vagueness partial knowledge To explain difference distinct uses sets valuations shall employ notions conjunctive disjunctive sets 425 A conjunctive set inclusive collection elements representing conjunctive property disjunctive set exclusive collection elements representing number possibilities actually realised For example set languages spoken Ethel conjunctive set element equally admissible set 1 6 representing possible outcomes throw die disjunctive set outcomes possible outcome actual score We argue sets valuations supervaluationism conjunctive Boolean possibility theory disjunctive More speciﬁcally supervaluationism set valuations identiﬁes conjunction interpretations admissible precisiﬁcations Boolean possi bility theory set valuations correspond possible epistemic states true state world Interestingly view supervaluationism Smith 36 refers plurivaluationism according language multiple valid interpretations In following sections introduce valuation pairs general model truthgaps

consider communications model different agents different degree conﬂicting goals objectives An agent required statement form prediction commitment future state world While potential rewards making

costs signiﬁcantly reduced Future contingency scenarios important AI applications involving natural language generation 31 overview automatic weather forecast generation 12 automatic medical diagnosis systems 29 To illustrate type problems involved consider example politician considering making pledge upcoming British General Election She like promise high reduction budget deﬁcit possible achieved cutting public expenditure resulting small increase possible unemployment She judges promise kind popular voters increase probability political party winning election One possibility decide crisp

signiﬁcant reduction debt minor increase unemployment able curry favour voters current general election reducing risk accused breaking promises subsequent election To quote van Deemter 39 precise promise easier break vague The notion valuation pairs truthgaps provide insight case The voters example interpret politician promising assertion absolutely true future date subsequent election reward accordingly However signiﬁcantly punish assertion turns absolutely false Hence future contingency scenarios truthgap associated vague assertion provides agent window opportunity maximise chance reward minimise risk loss Furthermore practice assertion decisions kind presence signiﬁcant epistemic uncertainty Consequently combining model truthgaps epistemic uncertainty bipolar belief pairs provide
