Angiofibroma uncommon intracardiac tumor Thus far 4 cases rare intracardiac tumor reported The present casereport describes intracardiac angiofibroma 57yearold healthy female The patient incidentally diagnosed left ventricle mass echocardiography We performed cardiac imaging surgical excision histological evaluation mass The angiofibroma demonstrated features different relatively common cardiac tumors fibroma myxoma angiosarcoma The cardiac MRI showed slightly high signal intensity T1 T2 central core lower signal intensity The resected tumor whitish rubbery mass Histologically tumor showed
