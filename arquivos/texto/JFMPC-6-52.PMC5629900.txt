prescribing controlled substances available 5 years proven reduce risk improve patient compliance2126 In spite guideline success CDC The National Pain Council reported recently March 2016 providers consistently implement practices patient agreements prescription monitoring programs urine screens decrease risk misuse1213 Providers assert guideline compliance interrupts normal clinical workflow consumes valuable time12 We conducted quality improvement project demonstrate possible successfully implement small primary care practice patient agreement monitoring policy fulfills governmental guidelines recommendations prescribing Schedule II medications chronic conditions pain ADHD Implementation recommended opioid prescribing practices daunting noncompliance recommendations addressed numerous studies Hariharan et al retrospectively examined patient agreement adherence cancellation22 The authors determined primary care physicians routinely monitor patient agreement adherence standardized protocol urine screening performed urine screens 45 eligible patients Khalid et al analyzed physician adherence opioid prescribing guidelines potential patient opioid misuse based physician status attending resident18 Less half patients group presented patient agreement twothirds received urine screen onethird granted multiple early refills Lasser et al reported baseline characteristics primary care study sites On average 453 patients offered patient agreement 397 received urine screens 35 received early refills16 After implementation strategies nurse care management use patient registry academic detailing electronic tools authors determined provider adherence prescribing guidelines improved Similar project studies concluded intervention components related safe prescribing guidelines controlled substances potential increase provider adherence reduce patient misuse controlled medications Unlike study authors focused specifically opioidrelated measures excluded stimulants important overlooked category Schedule II medications In study large proportion patients received prescription stimulants Federal state agencies grouped opioids stimulants Schedule II umbrella impose identical guidelines regulations potential illegal uses outcomes opioids versus stimulants different Opioids greater potential addiction overdose death Stimulants nonnarcotics greater potential diversion misuse Stimulant abuse ignored Schedule II literature diversion misuse growing problem especially collegeage population28 Our study adds literature examined number signed patient agreements measured adherence specific components agreement monitored narcotics stimulants time costeffective manner To best knowledge study measure improvements adherence bundled components signed Schedule II patient agreement implementation primary care practice Implementation success enhanced prescribers ability continue safely meet medication needs patients reducing prescriber risk All reported measures dramatically improved pre post time periods Adherence guidelines urine screen monitoring prescription monitoring program checks increased significantly The physicians commitment writing prescriptions outside 3month mandatory visit especially impressive prescriptions written postimplementation outside 3month window The implementation process compatible office workflow While directly measure cost believe associated implementation cost minimal The time cost factor introduce explain agreement patients negligible The nurse staff performed prescription monitoring checks slow periods day The monitoring program state funded free access registered users The patient Journal Family Medicine Primary Care 55 Volume 6 Issue 1 JanuaryMarch 2017 Downey et al Controlled substance treatment agreement incurred drug screening costs circumstances insurance refused payment In rare cases tests billed physicians fee substantially discounted rate No patient complaints regard laboratory costs received Some barriers implementation encountered During implementation laboratory performed urine screens introduced new software required staff training complicated creation custom laboratory panels necessary drugspecific testing Three patients expressed privacy concerns urine screens The concerns arise signing agreement time urine collection Patients reminded tests specific medication prescribed included results information No patients refused provide urine sample screening refused sign agreement Three patients agreement file nurse forgot offer opportunity review sign contract Limitations Several limitations apply project The project conducted single private practice providers specific local culture Both providers extremely motivated engaged project Results generalizable larger practices multiple providers implementation challenging Our experience translated small primary care practices seeking comply current guidelines prescribing Schedule II controlled substances Patients prescribed Schedule II medications overwhelmingly Caucasian 96 aged 60 44 applicable patients differing demographic characteristics Adherence monitored 7 months postimplementation Individual practices actively monitor policy adherence practice pattern embedded daily routine No data collected regard patients physicians perception policy While collect data patients repeatedly expressed clear understanding purpose agreement view contract positively The providers showed support agreement striving adhere agreement components We collect preexisting substance abuse risk factors opioid addiction misuse This data helpful describing population studied high risk opioid abuse Finally data collected patient outcomes know pain continued adequately managed Despite limitations project demonstrated ability introduce Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement small primary care practice excellent adherence required components contract Future studies replicate project practices different practice characteristics monitor adherence longer duration Conclusion The implementation Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement prescribing policy small primary care practice feasible significantly improved number patient agreements signed annual urine screens performed prescription monitoring program checks completed significantly decreased number Schedule II
