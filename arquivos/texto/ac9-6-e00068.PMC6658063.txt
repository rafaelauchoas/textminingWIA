worldwide HCC prognosis remains poor average survival rate 6 12 months Obstructive jaundice main clinical feature uncommon HCC HCC bile duct invasion rarer HCC vascular invasion We present case patients HCC diagnosed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography digital cholangioscopy HCC manifested obstructing lesion intrahepatic duct liver INTRODUCTION Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC prevalent cancers globally According World Health Organization HCC second common cause cancerrelated death worldwide Western countries In United States HCC incidence hospitalization mortality rates increasing considerable shift younger ages1 In 2010 annual incidence HCC 6 100000 United States2 HCC prognosis remains poor average survival rate 6 12 months3 The estimated worldwide annual death HCC 500000 highest rates Southeast Asia subSaharan Africa4 HCC silent clinical course present nonspeciﬁc symptoms features decompensated liver cirrhosis patients previously stable cirrhosis HCC metastasis occurs direct invasion hematogenous lymphatic routes Known sites metastases include lungs lymph nodes bone adrenal glands brain It uncommon HCC present obstructive jaundice main clinical feature However happens bile duct tumor thrombus likely cause Despite signiﬁcant improvement imaging modalities HCC obstructive jaundice bile duct thrombus incorrectly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma choledocholithiasis5 CASE REPORT A 40yearold African man medical history signiﬁcant hepatitis B exposure spontaneous clearance aortic valve sclerosis presented intermittent right upper quadrant pain
