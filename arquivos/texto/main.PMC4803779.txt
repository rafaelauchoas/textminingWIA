bioinformatics In 2001 Human Genome Project successfully completed ﬁrst human genome sequence Lander et al 2001 Venter et al 2001 With advent generation sequencing NGS platforms took 3 billion dollars 10 years complete little 1000 days The application NGS enabled interrogation human genome ways previously considered In recent years large bigdata projects utilized technology interrogate human genome ﬁnite provide valuable insights molecular mechanisms derlying diseases The 1000 genome project Genomes Project C et al 2010 2012 revealed diverse genetic variation different population groups The ENCODE project Consortium EP 2012 identi ﬁed characterized functional elements genome Similarly The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA httpcancergenomenih gov yielded valuable clues molecular biology variety
