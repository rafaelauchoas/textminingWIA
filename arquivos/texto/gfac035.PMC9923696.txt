Although prevalence cognitive impairments patients receiving dialysis previously reported 30 31 effects dialysis KTR regard cognitive functioning shown mixed results 8 10 30 32 Previous studies improvements cognitive functioning patients stopped receiving dialysis received transplantation suggesting preexisting cognitive impair ments reversible transplantation 1012 However results significant relation time transplantation group met criteria MCI Therefore findings imply cognitive impairments average 11 years transplantation considered stable highly unlikely recovered compared early stages posttransplantation The second aim study examine extent cognitive deficits related societal participation QoL Concerning participation results showed significant correlations lower scores neurocognitive tasks measuring memory mental speed attention executive functions reductions different aspects societal partic ipation This implies cognitively impaired KTR likely encounter difficulties fulfilling social vocational roles undertaking activities experience lower satisfaction participation life This study demonstrate relationship Previous research mainly focused examining extent cognitive functioning affected kidney transplantation 5 33 investigating possible consequences Apparently successfully receiving kidney transplant imply patients able resume previous level social functioning return premorbid role community Our findings suggest absence cognitive impairment indicating brain health decisive factor societal participation QoL KTR As QoL significant
