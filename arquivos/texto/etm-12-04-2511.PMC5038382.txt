addition pathogenic effects virus immune function disturbance plays impor tant role The immune response removes viruses causes immune injury hepatic cells cause virus mutation 9 The balance T lymphocyte subsets plays important role removal HBV 10 CD4 T lymphocytes identify exogenous antigenic peptides presented MHCII molecules mainly differentiate Th cells activation 11 CD8 T lymphocytes identify 2514 TIAN et al EFFECT OF ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL ON T CELL IMMUNE FUNCTION endogenous antigenic peptides presented MHCI molecules mainly differentiate CTL cells activa tion 11 After body infected HBV virus replicates host cells produces viral proteins 12 MHCI molecules cells combine proteins selectively form complexes These complexes identified specific antigens T lymphocytes activate CD8 T lymphocytes cause injury hepatic cells 13 At time CD4 T lymphocytes mediate activation B lymphocyte MHCII molecules surfaces promote B lympho cytes produce antiHBs helps clear HBV 14 This major reason HBV causes injury hepatic cells major mechanism involved host removal virus cells Cell levels CD4 CD8 T lymphocyte subsets peripheral blood ratio CD4 CD8 reflect cellular immunity state body Changes T lymphocyte subsets peripheral blood patients chronic hepatitis B reflect immunopathological changes patient cellular immunity 15 Moreover recent research reported T follicular helper TFH cells main Tcell subset instruct B helper cells produce antibody 16 These cells located lymph follicles colocalized interacted B cells They help B cells participate humoral immune response continuously

hydro lyzed dissociated adefovir esterase quickly oral intake It enters portal veins systemic circula tion It bisphosphonated active metabolite adefovir dipivoxil bisphosphonate cellular kinases Adefovir dipivoxil bisphosphonate competes natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate dATP inhibit activity HBV DNA polymerase integrates viral DNA strand stop synthesis inhibition virus replication 17 In addition adefovir able induce endogenous INF increase natural killer cell activity stimulate bodys immune response Therefore strong antiHBV function safe effective medicine decompensated liver cirrhosis patients 18 The present study innovative explores immune function T lymphocytes B liver cirrhosis patients compensated decompensated period treated adefovir dipivoxil The results showed differences virus negative conversion ratio groups achieve statistical significance compensated group decreased level ALT increased level albumin obviously higher decompensated period differences statistically significant After treatment level CD4 CD4CD8 ratio groups higher treatment level CD8 lower statistical significance noted differences groups CD4CXCR5 TFH cell IL2 IFNγ levels
