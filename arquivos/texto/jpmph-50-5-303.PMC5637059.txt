Design Participants This crosssectional study conducted 2015 Sanan daj capital city Kurdistan Province western Iran The study population included people 1540 years age living Sanandaj sample size 2000 persons Using cluster sampling method 10 persons desired age range selected cluster enrolled study Cluster heads se lected basis geocodes Sanandaj required data obtained Post Office The required data collected completing questionnaire examinations visiting households The data collected 4 trained terviewers dental students trained examine complete questionnaire Before field survey 4 trained examiners calibrated conducting oral examinations 25 persons research community order reduce interexaminer inconsistency The mean terexaminer consistency recording dental caries 92 They visited subjects home completed question naire direct observation examination number 4 mirror Medisporex catheter During examination respondents researchers sat near window order ensure maximum natural light Outcome Measures In study DMF index outcome measure determine number DMF In order analyze data determined DMF index converted binary index corresponding categories favorable unfavorable oral health status To determine DMF index dichotomize favorable unfavorable status took following steps Consensus reached ex pert panel including 2 dentists 2 epidemiologists health economist We decided weight missing teeth M financial problems associated teeth recovery filled teeth F sign financial accessibility First number M individu al multiplied 2 received greater coefficient Then specified number decayed teeth D mul tiplied 1 Next number F counted multiplied 05 received lower weight Based calculations score obtained person Based calculations score obtained person Dental caries lifetime disease highestpriority risk group 11 14 years age 20 Moreover World Health Organization considers DMF index 65 high children low 3544 years old 21 There fore assigned greater weight younger people equivalent decay Thus scores obtained people aged 25 years old multiplied 15 In people aged 25 years scores multiplied 1 We specified cutoff point define favorable unfa vorable status The cutoff point set quartile 75 People score quartile considered poor oral health status score 75 considered fa vorable oral health status Socioeconomic Status Indicators To determine SES method proposed ODonnell et al

metrics We assessed oral health status based DMF index sample urban population aged 1540 years results indicated presence poor DMF dex studied population The extent socioeconomic inequality high impressive alarming Lower socio economic groups poor oral health status Hence recommended adopt macrolevel policies reduce equality In order ensure justice oral health indicators necessary include
