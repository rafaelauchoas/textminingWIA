representing distinct direction 2 Modeling issues The nature multiagent learning depends strategies payoff functions game context game takes place This context includes players observe anothers actions period players played similar game past information help understand incentives predict opponents motivations One example role context difference environment ﬁxed pair agents plays period environments large population roughly similar agents When agents play period try inﬂuence future play natural benchmark solution concept equilibrium repeated game However repeated game equilibrium applicable environments large population agents To consider ﬁrst case games anonymous random matching Each period players ran domly matched play oneshot simultaneousmove game end round player observes play match The way player acts current round inﬂuence way current opponent plays tomorrow population sufﬁciently large compared discount factor player unlikely matched current opponent met current opponent long time An important implication learning theory myopic play approximately optimal population ﬁnite sufﬁciently large2 As second example consider model aggregate statistics Again period players randomly matched play oneshot game At end round population aggregates announced If population large player little inﬂuence population aggregates consequently little inﬂuence future play players reason depart myopic play Some experiments use design Each environments conceptual advantage suppose players trying learn optimal strategy inﬂuence future course overall In environments simple
