difficulty diagnosis preoperatively different bladder tumors types During paper tend represent case report terribly rare mesenchymal growth urinary bladder unusual location myxoma tumors occur A 48yearold feminine hospitalized obscure abdominal pain The patient underwent partial cystectomy histopathology reported presence myxoma urinary bladder Most tumors arising urinary bladder epithelial origin nonepithelial tumors account 5 urinary bladder tumors1 Myxoma soft tissue tumor characterized presence dense extracellular myxoid matrix It usually occurring variable locations aggressive type affect skeletal cardiac muscles2 Most tumors arise silently urinary bladder grow large size produce obstructive symptoms misdiagnosed malignant tumors Complete Excision tumor necessary rule malig nant features These tumors low incidence local recurrence usually pre sent single mass common females3 Case presentation A 48yearold female previously healthy previous surgical operations family history chronic diseases like hypertension diabetes mellitus father mother The patient presented general surgery clinic complaining vague abdominal pain symptoms frequency urination urgency history hema turia By exam localized lower abdominal tenderness significant findings Then patient underwent abdomen CT scan pelvic MRI Fig 1 diagnosed possess pelvic mass attached bladder revealed images Later patient referred urology clinic rule bladder origin cystoscopy performed revealed presence bulge right post lateral aspect urinary bladder intraluminal masses normalappearing mucosa patient underwent partial cystectomy excision mass patient discharged 2 days operation pathological features mass benign intramuscular myxoma cystic degeneration mass size 7 545 cm gross examination mass solid evidence hemorrhage necrosis sectioning contains yellow gelatinous material On histological examination evidence malignant features like atypia doesnt contain blood vessels crucial feature angiomyxoma Fig 2

Alserhan et al Fig 1 Abdominal CT pelvic MRI patient Fig 2 Histopathologic images tumor 50 benign cardiac tumors represented myxoma 75 cases cardiac myxoma occurs left atrium followed right atrium 18 right left ventricles 3 valves 1 Multiple myxoma represents 5 cases half bilateral origin hand recurrence rate skeletal myxoma exceptional cardiac myxoma rare observed 3 patient inadequate resection malignant change recurrences different site multifocal disease occurs frequently familial setting4 rarely occur genitalia like paratesticular region2 genitourinary tract unusual location tumor case reported literature missed diagnosed sacrosciatic hernia treatment successful herniorraphy contrary case diagnosis good time correct treatment3 Many cases reported kidney nephrectomy ported suspicion malignancy follow patients sign malignancy metastasis recurrence5 Conclusion Although myxoma commonly occurs skeletal cardiac muscle genitourinary tract unusual location tumor case reported literature cases reported kidney Its important distinguish benign myxoma tumor malignant lesions myxoid features Funding This research receive specific grant funding agencies public commercial notforprofit
