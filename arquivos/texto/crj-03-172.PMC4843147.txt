CASE REPORT ENDOSCOPY Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Complete Resection Rectal Remnant Mucosa Patient With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Naoki Ishii MD1 Hitoshi Akiyama MT1 Koyu Suzuki MD2 Yoshiyuki Fujita MD1 1Center Gastroenterology St Lukes International Hospital Tokyo Japan 2Department Pathology St Lukes International Hospital Tokyo Japan Abstract A 47yearold woman underwent prophylactic subtotal colectomy ileorectal anastomosis IRA familial adenomatous polyposis FAP 18 years ago She underwent 5 transanal endoscopic microsurgeries rectal remnant polyps referred treatment rectal remnant polyp recurrence Endoscopic submucosal dissection ESD performed remove multiple polypoid lesions circumferentially extended rectal remnant lesions spreading anastomotic site The rectal remnant mucosa resected 2 pieces complication Specimens showed highgrade adenoma malignancy Followup colo noscopy showed recurrence Introduction Subtotal colectomy ileorectal anastomosis IRA occasionally performed patients familial adeno matous polyposis FAP total proctocolectomy ileal pouchanal anastomosis IPAA produces better functional outcomes decreases infertility rate surgery12 However neoplasms occur rectal remnant IRA require additional treatments including secondary proctectomy3 Endoscopic submucosal dissection ESD recently performed treat superficial neoplasms digestive
