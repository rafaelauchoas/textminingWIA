intriguing question In paper focused linear setting natural candidate treats cost function edge associated delay Characterizing value ignorance concaveconvex cost functions direct extension work leave open question In setting players choose worst case scenario incomplete information setting One think behavior conservative players This suggests consider study corresponding Bayesian setting exists common prior distribution number active players players wish minimize expected costs A central related topic studied extensively decade price anarchy ratio social cost worst equilibrium optimal social cost 1811 Intuitively larger number social cost lost selﬁsh behavior The price anarchy studied complete information setting As results suggest way reduce price anarchy allow selﬁsh behavior sure number active participants remains unknown In paper quantify exact upper bound players gain knowing number participants We leave intriguing open problem Other directions proceed Assume players adopt qualitative decision criteria minmax regret Assume players different upper bounds number active players Study different types incomplete information assume edge cost functions common knowledge
