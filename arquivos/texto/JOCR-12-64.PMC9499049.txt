disorder caused autosomal recessive mutation Bglucocerebrosidase It multisystem disease patients present hematological abnormalities joint pain osteonecrosis developmental delay We present case 38yearold male painless solitary softtissue swelling left proximal tibia eventually diagnosed case Gauchers disease This case unique literature subcutaneous Gaucher mass associated significant past history evaluated standard approach bone tumor Case Presentation A 38yearold man presented outpatient department solitary painless softtissue swelling left proximal tibia noticed 6 months gradually progressed present size 9x5 cm period 6 months General physical examination revealed moderate splenomegaly Radiographs showed osteolytic lesion left proximal tibia cortical erosion Radiographs skeletal survey revealed similar osteolytic lesions Hematological investigations revealed thrombocytopenia A serum protein electrophoresis normal urine negative myeloma proteins Blood workup endocrine abnormalities normal limits MRI lesion suggests bone infarct Biopsy lesion showed giant binucleate storage cell filled glucocerebrosides suggestive Gauchers disease The diagnosis confirmed elevated plasma levels glucocerebrosidases Conclusion Gauchers disease rare metabolic disease bone mimic primary bone tumor metastasis A stepwise meticulous approach biopsy elevated plasma levels glucocerebrosidase helps establish diagnosis Once high index suspicion Gauchers disease adult multiple osteolytic lesions significant past medical surgical history Keywords Gauchers disease lysosomal

Rahman SH et al wwwjocrcoin predilection contrast increased incidence type I disease patients Ashkenazi Jewish descent 8 The medullary expansion related replacement bone marrow Gaucher cells manifesting enlargement bone shaft cortical thinning In rare instances expansion medullary cavity lead cortical destruction result extraosseous extension Gaucher cell deposits mimicking malignancy 9 In instances meticulous stepwise examination helps establishment diagnosis decreases incidence errors especially significant history suggestive Gauchers disease An approach solitary musculoskeletal swelling followed A biopsy clinical radiological diagnosis established biopsy confirm diagnosis establishing diagnosis shortcut 10 Observation supportive therapy mainstay absence pathological fracture disabling deformity As patient highly prone pathological fractures fracture management requires pre operative optimization enzyme therapy 11 Availability additional blood clotting factors platelets increased bleeding risk anesthesiologist maintain adequate oxygenation avoid precipitating bone crisis 12 There increased risk infection patients 13 Conclusion Gauchers disease rare metabolic disease
