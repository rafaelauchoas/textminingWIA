uneventful retrieval endodontic file 4 year old child A case report J Int Oral Health 20157Suppl 27476 Abstract The majority foreign body ingestions occur pediatric population peak incidence ages 6 months 6 years Safety dental treatment children overemphasized Uncooperative mentally physically handicapped children prone ingestion aspiration dental instruments populations In event recommended dental practitioners examine instrument use safeguard slippage breakage Treatment endodontic device requires use proper isolation rubber dam Key Words Accidental gastrointestinal tract rubber dam swallowing ingestion endoscopy foreign body Introduction Endodontic treatment great advantage overextraction We save teeth endodontic procedures extraction successful conservative mode treatment However mishaps accidental ingestion endodontic instrument occur treatment carried application rubber dam especially child patient Such mishaps rare potentially harmful patients causes anxiety clinician When accidental ingestion endodontic instrument occurs endodontist basic knowledge diagnostic procedure complications methods retrieving swallowed instrument ability reassure patient1 For endodontic instruments prevalence aspiration 00009100000 root canal treatments prevalence ingestion 008100000 root canal treatments2 The reason relatively low reported incidence endodontic equipment involved use rubber dam Aspiration foreign bodies dental treatment rare accidents happen considered major complication terms treatment needed avert event impact patients health The present case report describes rare case swallowing hand pro taper file pulpectomy 4 years old patient provides knowledge possible complications arise accidental swallowing instruments treatment modalities depending location instrument gastrointestinal tract respiratory tract Case Report A 4yearold male patient reported department pediatric preventive dentistry Annasaheb Chudaman Patil Memorial Dental College

immediately Prevention mishaps clinical practice All endodontic procedure strictly carried rubber dam isolation Rotary files preferred hand files endodontic treatment pediatric patient If hand files floss tied handle files length 18 inches easy retrieval instrument Dentist work dry environment wet conditions minimize chances slippage instrument Conclusion The accidental ingestion aspiration dental instrument potential lifethreatening complication In cases prevention better cure applicable Rubber dam isolation strictly applied dentist aware handling situation having knowledge diagnosis
