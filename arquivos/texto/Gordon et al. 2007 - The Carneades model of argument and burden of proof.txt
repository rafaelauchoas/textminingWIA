Argumentation schemes stereotypical patterns reasoning everyday conversational argumentation contexts like legal scientiﬁc argumentation They represent patterns nondeductive reasoning long studied argumentation theory Historically descendants socalled topics Aristotle thought useful inventing arguments evaluating In recent times schemes identiﬁed studied 113 Despite body work little argumentation theory formalize logical structure schemes By contrast artiﬁcial intelligence increasingly interested argumentation schemes potential making signiﬁcant improvements reasoning capabilities artiﬁcial agents 33743 In argumentation theory device evaluating schemes 20 speciﬁc set critical questions matching scheme The questions represent attacks challenges criticisms answered adequately argument ﬁtting scheme default The critical questions evidently need formalized scheme order capture logic scheme defeasible argument The biggest problem carry 2 Persuasion dialogues like deliberation course action The difference persuasion deliberation starting point goal dialogue subject matter A persuasion dialogue begins making claim goal persuading opponent accept claim Such claims course action best topic Deliberation dialogues hand begin problem goal ﬁnding solution problem Typically ﬁrst phase deliberation goal identifying stakeholders interests Only later brainstorming proposals actions collected When proposal defended deliberation dialogue temporarily shift persuasion dialogue 3 We address article argumentation schemes develop evolve design good

respondent asks critical questions burden proof shifts proponents defeating undercutting argument temporarily critical question answered successfully However suggested differences critical questions strongly weakly produce shift The notion shift burden proof problematic topic special kind case argument forward critical question matching scheme argument asked Does merely asking question argument default burden questioner provide evidence Providing dialogue mechanism handle representation burden proof shift exchange goes currently available Such observations led theories allocation burden proof critical questions asked 50 According theory respondent asks critical question burden proof automatically shifts proponents provide answer fails argument defaults defeated On theory proponent provides appropriate answer plausibility original argument restored This called shifting burden theory SB theory According theory asking critical question original argument default The question asked needs backed evidence shift burden proponent This called backup evidence theory BE theory In AI recently observed argumentation schemes related defeasible inference rules non monotonic logic Bex et al

connection premises conclusion reason given circumstances They express exceptions defeasible reasons Verheij 43 proposes similar account suggesting useful handle different kinds questions differently He begins showing critical questions different kinds roles 1 They question premise scheme holds 2 They point exceptional situations scheme 3 They set conditions proper use scheme 4 They point arguments attack scheme 4 Dialogues require multiple agents A single agent viewed arguing switching forth pro viewpoints The proponent opponent dialogue roles agents Any number agents occupy roles TF Gordon et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 875896 879 Verheij applies ideas Deﬂog logic 42 Critical questions type 2 undercut argument type 3 refute speciﬁc implicit assumptions argument rests type

premise true Such accounts terms ordinary premises exceptions defeasible inference rule provide natural expla nation critical questions shift burden answering proponent argument questions backed evidence However leave issue unaddressed viz dialogical status ordinary premises argumentation scheme Verheijs claim critical questions premises scheme redundant makes sense logical setting static information state issue premise given derivable given In dialogical setting possibly changing information state different Suppose example argument instantiating scheme Expert Opin ion forward said response The question current dialogical context conclusion argument acceptable This boils question si lence implies consent major minor premise Or legal example suppose plaintiff legal dispute claims defendant contract arguing offer accepted defendant citing legal rule offer acceptance constitute contract Although argument logically perfectly acceptable according Dutch civil law sufﬁcient claims offer acceptance backed evidence Suppose plaintiff provides evidence example form witness testimonies If defendant continues reply plantiffs argument acceptable Dutch law civil procedure states factual claims questioned party accepted court The upshot dialogical context different kinds premises distinguished supported grounds assumed questioned hold absence evidence contrary In article ﬁrst kind ordinary premises second kind assumptions kind exceptions Note assumptions negation exceptions5 We claim static relational AI models argumentation handle distinctions kinds premises distinctions sense procedural context Carneades contrast designed use procedural contexts The ﬁnal feature argumentation motivating design Carneades concerns allocation burden proof especially legal domain The general intuitions related distinction types premises discussed When party provides argument instantiating applicable scheme burden party prove ordinary premises challenged assumptions burden shifts party defeat argument rebutting pointing exceptional circumstances Legal systems ﬁnegrained distinctions different kinds burdens proof want Carneades account distinctions In civil law suits plaintiff generally burden proof This simple notion burden proof refer different things 52 p 270 called risk nonpersuasion burden persuasion burden production The risk nonpersuasion operates case come hands jury duty producing evidence implies liability ruling judge disposing issue leaving question open jurys deliberations Wigmore wrote risk nonpersuasion shifts duty producing evidence satisfy judge shifting characteristic 52 pp 285286 McCormick Evidence 40 p 425 deﬁnes burden producing evidence terms The burden producing evidence issue means liability adverse ruling generally ﬁnding directed

evidence required establish ultimate question fact allocation risk nonpersuasion degree The burden persuasion terms 26 p 89 deﬁnes degree factﬁnder persuaded order ultimate claim proved 5 Thus use

burden persuasion plaintiff burden persuasion main claim observed Prakken Sartor 35 burden persuasion statements distributed parties In case exceptions burden production rests defendant burden satisﬁed plaintiff burden persuading court exception hold This case instance exceptions criminal law Carneades claim able handle different ways distributing burdens production persuasion We discussing critical questions affect burden proof meant burden production particular In formal accounts distributions burden production simply expressed formulating exceptions However shown Prakken 30 distributions burden persuasion expressed current mainstream AI formalisms argumentation In particular express distinction cases exception proven decision maker convinced exception true cases exception merely plausible decision maker reason doubt true Current nonmonotonic logics model kind situation Accordingly Prakken Sartor 34 based Dungs grounded semantics adjusted 30 cope The approach taken Carneades problem determining burden proof distributed follows The burden production distributed dividing premises different types evidence ordinary premises challenged assumptions produced proponent argument premises evidence exceptions produced respondent In addition initially low proof standard needs assigned statement premise After burden production met burden persuasion distributed raising proof standard assigned statement Changing proof standard cause burden shift party Summarizing Carneades allows burdens production persuasion allocated separately proponent respondent modiﬁed course dialogue The initial allocation burden production regulated premise types argumentation scheme applied The burden persuasion allocated assigning appropriate proof standard As dialogue progresses subject argumentation protocol burdens reallocated changing assignment premise types proof standards speech acts designed purpose 3 Argument graphs We begin deﬁning structure argument

dialogues participants try resolve difference opinion arguing tenability claim trying persuade participants adopt point view Dialogue systems persuasion regulate utterances participants conditions effects utterances propositional commitments dialogue terminates outcome dialogue Dialogue systems persuasion deﬁned mainly areas argumentation theory AI Law multiagent systems See Prakken 32 recent overview As outcome dialogues dialogue systems focus dialogue participant changed internal subjective beliefs course dialogue observable agents Systems kind especially research multiagent systems 27 Other systems focus intersubjective consensus dialogue participants looking publicly committed TF Gordon et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 875896 893 rejected certain statements Basically consensus achieved end dialogue parties committed committed main claim This original approach argumentation theory 46 Finally dialogue systems participants publicly declared standpoints standards imposed outside account statement declared acceptable certain dialogue state consensus reached This class systems Carneades meant support In AI work standards come nonmonotonic logic applied current explicit consensus dialogue state This approach taken Pleading Game 14 conditional entailment 12 instance Loui 24 variant Simari Louis 39 Brewka 5 prioritized default logic In Prakken 31 idea reﬁned First purely dialogical notion acceptability deﬁned terms attacking surrendering reply relations dialogue utterances On basis relations deﬁned initial dialogue Then proven class inference based argumentation systems satisfying grounded semantics initial main claim logically implied current consensus assuming participants logically optimal moves dialogue Carneades takes Prakkens approach extreme replacing use relational consequence notion purely procedural notions proof burdens proof standards Also Carneades replaces Prakkens reply relations dialogue utterances dialectical status statements fully abstracting speech acts dialogues 73 Other work modeling burden proof Carneades modeling proof standards inspired Freeman Farleys DART 10 implemented model dialectical argumentation based semiformal speciﬁcation DART models forms defeasible reasoning rules including standard logic principles modus ponens modus tollens nonstandard ones abductive contrario reasoning The status arguments deﬁned terms argument game parameterized proof level main claim DART allow different levels proof premises main claim shifts burden proof party dialogical status statements account Also distinction burden production burden persuasion explicitly addressed As discussed Section 2 Prakken 30 adapts Prakken Sartors 34 argumentation based grounded semantics let allow shifts burden proof The modiﬁed assumes input ordered set rules allocation proof burdens literals plaintiff defendant The argument game modiﬁed allow players plaintiff defendant different dialectical roles proponent opponent different propositions Although Prakken 30 explicitly distinguish burdens production persuasion Prakken Sartor 35 argue work fact models distribution burden persuasion They argue different proof levels modeled adopting different deﬁnitions binary defeat relation arguments assumed Dungstyle approach Our account Section 6 proof burdens represented Carneades meant respect Prakken Sartors observations retaining special features Carneades Finally Prakken et al 33 modiﬁed persuasion dialogue game 31 allow debates burden proof Allocations proof burdens expressed special speech act moved reply challenge claim Allocations challenged gives rise metadialogues burden proof The resulting dialogue provides possible dialogical context Carneades burden allocations agreed dialogue translated assignment premise types proof standards 8 Conclusion Carneades formal mathematical model argument structure evaluation applies proof standards determine acceptability statements issuebyissue basis The main original contribution Carneades method allocating burden proof proponent respondent premise separately premise types proof standards dialectical status statements Useful modeling legal dialogues burden production burden persuasion handled separately different responsible party applicable proof standard 35 Following 30 approach allows burdens proof distributed parties 894 TF Gordon et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 2007 875896 applicable proof standard changed dialogue progresses stage stage Finally Carneades allows critical questions argumentation schemes modeled additional premises assumptions exceptions Carneades semantic model argumentation calculus However semantic model formulated terms computable functions lambda calculus formal As semantic model question soundness completeness Carneades arise Rather relevant question concerns validity semantic model Are semantics sufﬁcient providing kind argumentation support required intended application scenarios This question answered purely formal means requires experiments realistic test cases Functional programming languages easily implement model software Indeed Carneades fully implemented way Scheme programming language 22 The implementation computes acceptability statements given argument graph context inputs It generate argument diagrams The diagrams Section 6 article generated program Further work required modeling legal proof standards preponderance evidence reasonable doubt Although validation efforts far mainly legal domain Carneades intended general model argumentation restricted application domain Outside legal context plan evaluate suitability Carneades practical reasoning deliberation dialogues When completed Carneades support range argumentation use cases including

induction structure argument graphs Recall G ﬁnite acyclic statement occurs We ﬁrst consider acceptability statement node s parents A state ment acceptable iff satisﬁes proof standard Since G contain argument pro s proof standards s trivially acceptable We examine holds function premise p containing s If p cid6s s accepted p clearly holds s rejected p clearly hold s stated questioned p hold s acceptable If p s s stated accepted p holds s rejected p hold s questioned p hold s acceptable Finally p s s accepted p clearly hold s rejected p clearly holds s stated questioned p holds s acceptable Consider statement node s G parent node Again s acceptable iff satisﬁes proof standard All proof standards depend arguments pro s G These arguments unambiguously identiﬁed induction hypothesis theorem holds parent statements s premises Then clearly proof standards s unambiguously acceptable acceptable We ﬁnally examine holds function premise s Since function depends acceptability dialectical status s clearly premises s unambiguously hold hold cid2 Theorem 2 For argument context C proof standards BA DV argument graph G statement s exists s s acceptable TF Gordon et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171
