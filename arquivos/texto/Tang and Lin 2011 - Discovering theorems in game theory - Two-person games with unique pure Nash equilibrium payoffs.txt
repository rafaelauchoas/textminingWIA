2011 20102020 Thus class games satisfy condition 10 best response player 2 strategy strategy player maximum payoff The following example games usual player 1 row player player 2 column player ﬁrst number cell payoff row player second column player 3 6 4 5 5 1 2 3 1 4 6 2 It unique equilibrium 3 6 As mentioned condition 11 symmetric condition 10 roles players swapped So conditions 1213 Condition

2 direction matter strategy player 2 chooses From rowwise perspective players cooperative sense condition 10 However column wise angle condition implies stronger weak ordering player 1s strategy set player 2s strategy increasing player 1s strategy order players payoffs weakly increase Therefore player 1 ﬁrst choose favorite dominant strategy followed player 2s best response strategy best response player 1s best cooperate direction Condition 13 symmetrical condition 12 The following proposition summarizes players behaviors games corresponding conditions 1215 players obtain maximal payoffs Proposition 3 Given game satisﬁes conditions 1215 player 1s player 2s payoff b maximal strategy b b PNE players receive maximum payoffs b Proof Suppose game satisﬁes 12 b maximum payoff proﬁle player

remaining ones capture games gets wants receives maximum payoff 5 We unilaterally order equivalence distinguish order equivalence 16 requires row column orders games players 2020 P Tang F Lin Artiﬁcial Intelligence 175 2011 20102020 equilibrium state real competition players Thus conclusion draw experiment classes games expressed conjunction binary clauses class weakly unilaterally competitive games general class competitive fair games unique PNE payoffs For set conditions consider strict twoperson games different proﬁles different payoffs player Among results returned program exactly conjuncts Kats Thisses weakly unilaterally competitive condition turn special cases games dominant strategies correspond games dominant strategies Motivated results consider certain equivalent classes games strict game unique PNE iff bestresponse equivalent strictly competitive game There directions future work An obvious interesting theorems discovered Theorem 1 classes games PNE games PNEs Pareto optimal More importantly like methodology applied classes game PNE In fact recently classes potential games supermodular games best response equivalent 18 Our program shows classes games
