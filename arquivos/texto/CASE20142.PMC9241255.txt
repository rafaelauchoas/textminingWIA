Grand Medical Center Hofu Yamaguchi Japan BACKGROUND Idiopathic dissecting cerebral aneurysms IDCAs male dominant extremely rare children Many IDCAs children located posterior cerebral artery supraclinoid internal cervical artery No cases IDCA distal anterior cerebral artery ACA reported OBSERVATIONS A previously healthy 7monthold boy experienced afebrile seizures presented authors hospital 1 week seizure He feeling neurological deficits The authors diagnosed ruptured aneurysm right distal ACA based imaging results He underwent emergency craniotomy prevent rerupture aneurysm Using intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography authors confirmed peripheral blood flow performed aneurysmectomy Pathological examination aneurysm revealed thickened intima fragmentation internal elastic lamina hematoma aneurysmal wall The authors ultimately diagnosed IDCA cause indicated including history trauma The boy recovered surgery subsequently discharged complications LESSONS
