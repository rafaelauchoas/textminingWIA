A 73 year old man ATC stage IVB operated undergoing near total thyroidectomy pathological remnant tissue showed quick partial response treatment drug The patient single metastasis brain 9 months died bronchopneumonia undergoing neurosurgical intervention complete removal lesion A 74 year old woman ATC stage IV operated undergoing near total thyroidectomy neoadjuvant treatment drug continued surgical treatment She partial remission local disease distant metastasis lasted 14 months She died 4 months later cancer progression Lenvatinib 14 mg appears effective fast tolerated BACKGROUND Anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC rare aggressive cancers humans The standard treatment surgical intervention possible plus chemotherapy accelerated hyper fractionated external beam radiotherapy EBR

poor The published papers shown median PFS OS ranging respectively 40 425 74 106 months5 6 The best results appear phase II study5 6 However study partial response seen 24 cases 4 patients 17 able complete study response developed severe effects treatment initial dose 24 mg In study patients enrolled criterion inclusion expected survive 8 weeks dose lenvatinib suppose clinical condition bad The stage patients IVA IVC reported cases able finish study showed best results Our cases offer interesting points speculation In case PFS 8 months recurrence disease brain There data crossing lenva tinib bloodbrain barrier regards MTK inhibitors suppose reduced transfer brain reduced concentration activity level1013 On hand locoregional recurrences sites body present Rather lenvatinib appeared exert good locoregional control inasmuch CTPET showed remarkable reduction FDG uptake neck The overall survival 102 months longer patient passed away bronchopneumonia likely immunosuppressive treatment neuro surgical intervention removed completely metastasis The second case appears surprising considering stage general clinical condition We PFS 14 months OS 18 months partial remission came near complete remission Both patients tolerated starting dose 14 mg considering fact effects related dose serum levels1416 An initial speculation complex mecha nism regulation MTK cascades exist specific effective dose hook effect occurs efficacy decrease Although data vitro effects ATC cells lenvatinib dose depen dent17 18 study point fact reports exist like hook effect increasing dose drug If analyse cases reported literature cases comparable advanced stage PFS 90 279 months3 series patients treated 14 mg progressive reduction drug unfortunately paper specified dose cases treated We speculate cases enjoyed good response dose lenvatinib high tolerated patients continue important effects effects related oral dose1416 However response long lasting fast showing powerful activity 14 mg lenvatinib Regarding hypothesis possibility intermediate dose exert special activity ATC studies vitro help doseactivity profile drug As stated studies exist showing dose dependent activity17 18 However higher concentrations studied mind studies vitro ATC cells represent reality vivo lenvatinib exerts fundamental action vessels Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Regarding molecular analysis data appear special predictive mutation better response In conclusion consecutive cases treated lenva tinib enjoyed good response 14 mg Further studies vitro clinical trials encouraged test lenvatinib ATC lower doses standard 24 mg dose From practical point view suggest trying Learning points Diagnosis anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC usually histological However special cases cytology examination expert pathologist sufficient case 2 Lenvatinib low medium dosage 14 mg cases demonstrated highly effective quick controlling disease Two possible explanations speculated simply lower dose allow better treatment patients absence important effects critical patients especially powerful activity intermediate dosage exerted complex balance multi tyrosine kinase cascade ATC Research vitro clinical
