negotiation new researchers ﬁelds MultiAgent Systems Game Theory However research makes assumptions necessarily apply genuine negotiations humans assuming complete information 519 rationality human negotiator 5713 In sense assume parties rational behavior describing decisions agents rational utility maximizing agents deviate prescribed behavior For example Faratin et al 5 assume agents motivated maximizing joint utility outcome agents utility maximizers seek Paretooptimal agreements In similar manner 6713 assert agents strategy follow equilibriums strategy best response opponents strategy In words agent incentive deviate strategy None researchers looked negotiation process involving incomplete information negotiations humans While approaches appropriate context applied settings Dealing bounded rationality opponent researchers suggested new notions equilibria trembling hand equilibrium described Rasmusen 21 p 139 probability models For example Capra et al 3 use called standard logit model In model probabilities assigned decisions Those probabilities proportional exponential functions expected payoffs They use model order enable players update beliefs players This model equivalent assuming expected payoffs subjected deviations extreme value distribution That logit model assumes decisions 826 R Lin et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 2008 823851 perfect noise It tries deal situations These noisy decisions interpreted unobserved random changes preferences errors responding expected payoffs Similar Capra et al agent assigns probability believed type opponent However try avoid need adding special mechanism assumes actions opponent characterized noise In addition recent paper Kraus et al 11 automated agent negotiates efﬁciently humans Although deal negotiation humans settings complete information That agents know exactly world state parameters changing affects agent First identiﬁed perfect equilibrium strategies model Then observed human players necessarily follow equilibrium strategies Thus added heuristics argumentation tailored speciﬁc settings enable effective negotiation perfect equilibrium agent We hand propose general model agent negotiate efﬁciently multiattribute negotiations bounded rational agents incomplete information Other researchers suggested shifting quantitative decision theory qualitative decision theory 24 In model necessarily assume opponent follow equilibrium strategy try utility maximizer Also model better suited cases utility preferences unknown expressed ordinal scales preference relations 4 This approach appropriate settings maximin criteria generally context enables agent follow pessimistic approach probability offer accepted Another way deal bounded rationality suggested Luce 15 introduced choice axiom The choice axiom

Luces survey choice axiom 16 As believe model estimation acceptance rate opponents offer Several methods proposed dealing incomplete information preferences opponent For example Bayes theorem core

following subsections 41 The decision making valuation component As Brafman Tennenholtz 1 state extensions qualitative decision theory pursued We contend extension negotiation uncertainty bounded

experiments While provide theoretical foundations approach demonstrate effectiveness experiments people environment incomplete information described Section 5 411 Generating offers The motivation mechanism generating offers automated agent like propose offer yields highest utility value However conﬂicting interests high probability offer rejected opponent To overcome agent evaluates possible offers based utility probability rival accept An initial version offer generating mechanism presented 14 Based preliminary experimental results decided improve mechanism Thus instead directly utility

ordering function orders offer cid5o ordinal scale 1 O according utility value compared offers O In order facilitate computations divide offers ordering number O obtain range 0 1 Note certain offer ranked differently utility value agent offer believed utility value opponent In addition Luce numbers estimate probability agent accepting offer following Luces choice axiom models assign probability offer 15 Based Property 31 higher utility offer higher Luce number As choice axioms usually assign probabilistic beliefs tendency agent propose offer believe Luce numbers provide good estimation acceptance offers Since opponent tries estimate offer accepted agent Luce numbers account Then agent tries estimate opponents point view opponent accept offer This estimating sum Luce numbers agent presumed type opponent This sum estimation acceptance offer multiplied ranking value offer opponent The sum agents calculation method estimating social 828 R Lin et al Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 2008

values agents estimation offer agents estimation opponents point view pessimistic assumption probability offer accepted based agent favors offer After calculating minimum value offers agent selects offer maximum value minima order try maximize utility Thus qualitative offer generation mechanism selects intuitively best offer offers agent believes accepted In rest section process formally First
