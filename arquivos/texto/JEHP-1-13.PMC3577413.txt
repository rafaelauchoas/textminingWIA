gotten mammogram previous 3 years19 Low adherence recommended screening behaviors similarly demonstrated Iranian women27 When compared studies Iranian women likely maintenance action stages Asian American Indian Filipino25 Cambodian22 Chinese23 Chinese Filipino28 women This likely reflects greater acculturation regular mammography testing Iranian women We stage distribution varied age marital

older women likely action stage formed lowest numbers maintenance stage The odds maintenance stage likely middle age followed youngest women OR496 196 respectively These findings help creation interventions tailored encourage older women progress maintenance stage The normative belief Iranians older women spend time family issues So helpful family members husbands informed risk developing breast cancer importance regular mammogram screening detect early diagnosis Our results similar reported Cambodian Korean Chinese Filipino American2228 Swiss women29 inconsistent studies Chinese23 Korean immigrants21 differ stages marital status Considering high percent married women action stage results suggest spouses useful source social support The number married women action stage dropped

However family history create fear apprehension impede getting mammogram barrier facilitator findings support idea There need explore cultural beliefs despite positive perceived outcomes breast cancer diagnosed early stage having history barrier women Unlike findings health insurance predict stage adoption mammography222328 These results related difference insurance coverage Iran compared countries There different types insurance Iran provide similar services integrated category Further insurance coverage pay high cost visit physician issue influence regular physician visits subsequently result receiving physicians recommendation regular mammography In addition insurance pays small mammography costs salient difference insured uninsured women regard The results proved hypothesis health beliefs related stage adoption mammography The HBM suggests greater perceived threat results preventive behaviors Women advanced stages change reported higher perceived susceptibility For women relapse stage retained beliefs mammography act accordingly SCM theory posits cycle precontemplation maintenance stages It clear recycles preadoption stages beliefs undergo salient changes decreasing perceived threats increasing barriers factors influencing health behaviors Contrary results previous studies conducted rural Korea30 Korean immigrants USA21 reported perceived susceptibility predicted stage mammography recent mammogram findings similar Kathleen greater likelihood action relapse stage perceived susceptibility3 It noted perceived threat developing breast cancer overall concept risk appraisal goes perceived threat31 This reason different perceived severity women different stages There need explore risk appraisal according normative beliefs characteristic culture sociodemographic status access effective screening treatment services related breast cancer Iranian women HBM SCM postulate people action healthy behavior believe efficacy action barriers outweighed perceived positive outcomes1532 Contrary hypotheses results significant differences relapse action stages given perceived benefits differed preadoption adoption stages reported researchers17283335 The women maintenance stage lower benefits relapse action stages According SCM beliefs differ stage36 supported results women relapse stage reported highest perceived benefits getting mammogram women stages There possibility despite acting recommended health behavior acknowledge express benefits behavior The odds greater adoption preadoption 6 Journal Education Health Promotion Vol 1 Taymoori et al Mammography stage adoption stages adding perceived benefits reported studies232833 Women relapse stage lowest barriers compared action maintenance stages The prior experiences getting mammogram influenced current future intentions attitudes related breast cancer screening21 It women relapse stage experienced barriers like pain embarrassment fear These feelings normalized explaining women relapse stage lower perceived barriers adoption stages Except relapse stage important differences precontemplators adoption stages related perceived barriers getting mammogram Similar findings323242833 results revealed stages progress early advanced perceived barriers decreased The findings current study indicate women relapse stage reported highest perceived benefits higher perceived susceptibility severity lowest barriers It unique finding needs research detect factors impact having regular mammogram For example interpersonal influences including social support exposure models interpersonal norms likely important correlates particularly Iranian cultural context It realized specific changes item level perceived beliefs predict progress stages24 For example woman preadoption stages declares getting mammogram painful means belief influenced vicarious learning prior experience Exploring itemlevel beliefs help plan conduct effective interventions tailored stage mammography adoption CONCLUSION This study provides test associations stages mammography adoption based SCM combined selected aspects HPM Iranian women Results indicate differences stages change related beliefs current future intentions participants relapse stage Thus Iranian women relapse stage mammography significantly differ beliefs intention getting mammogram compared women action maintenance stages This finding requires exploration Given lack populationbased mammography clinical breast exam screening programs rate relapse low adherence regular screening behavior breast cancer women sample Iranian women need conduct research theoretically based interventions designed decrease relapse especially younger Iranian women If intervention programs achieve success number adoption stages prevent relapse worth Further important understand older women likely maintain behavior It important distinction perceived related beliefs mammography according age better understood Therefore intervention programs aimed increasing mammogram behavior tailored stage change age socioeconomic factors ACKNOWLEDGMENT We like thank Deputy Research Technology Kurdistan University Medical Sciences providing financial support
