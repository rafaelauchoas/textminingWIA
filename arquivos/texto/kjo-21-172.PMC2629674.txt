mimicking infectious keratitis flap margin limbus appeared postoperative day laser situ keratomileusis LASIK Methods A 36yearold woman underwent uneventful bilateral simultaneous LASIK developed multiple round infiltrate flap margin reaching limbus 11 oclock 6 oclock area eyes Results The flap lifted irrigation performed antibiotics infiltration appear The infiltrate concentrated periphery extended limbus Direct smear culture bacteria fungus negative Topical prednisolone acetate 1 eye drops added infiltrative condition resolved Conclusions LASIK induced peripheral infiltrative keratitis infectious origin ruled reported Korean Journal Ophthalmology 213172174 2007 Key Words DLK LASIK topical corticosteroid Laser situ keratomileusis LASIK shown effective treatment myopia hyperopia

Korean Ophthalmologic Society November 2006 172 Case Report A 36 year old woman went routine bilateral simultaneous LASIK March 23 2006 refractive error 400 D sphere 100 D cylinder axis 180 eyes NAVEX SYSTEM Nidek Advanced Visual Excimer NIDEK USA local eye clinic The operation progressed unremarkably signs bleeding flap edge surgery 05 Moxifloxacin eye drops 01 fluorometholone eye drops prescribed 4 times day The day operation severe photophobia bilateral redness whitish changes cornea complained watering patient As infiltration grew worse transferred hospitals department ophthalmology Visual acuity came 2025 eyes correction Both Intraocular pressure 11 mmHg noncontact tonometry Through slitlamp examination lids appeared normal indications meibomitis blepharitis Mild congestion conjunctiva Numerous round infiltrate seen flap margin Fig 1 diffused 11 oclock 6 oclock direction The infiltrate concentrated periphery faded centrally center flap left unaffected There distinguishable epithelial defects Also anterior chamber showed cells flare SW Moon et al BILATERAL PERIPHERAL INFILTRATIVE KERATITIS AFTER LASIK A B Fig 1 White multiple corneal infiltrates periphery lamellar flap margin noted day LASIK eyes A right eye B left eye A B Fig 2 Peripheral flap infiltration progressed limbus second day flap lifting antibiotics irrigation A right eye B left eye Because shape infiltration diffusely round rule infection During flap lifting antibiotics irrigation bacterial fungal culture obtained 05 moxifloxacin eye drops fortified vancomycin 50 mgml eye drops given eye 4 times day The infiltration improve 2nd day operation infiltrate developed involve flap edge 2 oclock 11 oclock direction involved limbus eyes Direct smear culture bacteria fungus human negative Blood immunodeficiency disease hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C antigen rheumatoid factor Creactive protein turned negative But infiltrate advance centrally topical antibiotics margin appearing clear Fig 2 We started administrating 1 topical prednisolone acetate eye drops 3 hours tests performed On 6th day operation symptoms showed improvement The infiltrate peripheral area decreased interface significantly diminished remarkably Fig 3 Refraction 025 200 10 right eye 125 175150 left eye visual acuity improved 2020 The IOP eyes fogginess 10 mmHg D iscussion infiltrates Corneal infiltrations LASIK relatively uncommon complications Because corneal represent nonspecific accumulation inflammatory cells possible causes considered Probably important complication infectious keratitis An infection LASIK rapidly progressive potentially vision threatening If infection ruled etiologies entertained etiologies Generally peripheral corneal infiltrates associated including blepharitisrelated staphylococcus hypersensitivity infiltrates Terriens marginal degeneration Moorens ulcer peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated autoimmune collagen vascular disease45 Singhal et al6 reported case likeliness case Young man developed band infiltrate flap margin limbus extending 2 oclock 9 oclock eyes The infiltrate concentrated periphery faded centrally progressed diffusely 173 Kor J Ophthalmol Vol21 No3 2007 A B Fig 3 After adding topical prednisolone acetate topical antibiotics decreased infiltration lamellar flap corneal limbus 6th day flap lifting antibiotics irrigation A right eye B left eye interface leading typical diffuse lamellar keratitis The infiltrate responded topical prednisolone acetate 1 eye drops Ambrosio et al7 Lahner et al5 reported respectively 2 cases sterile peripheral infiltration LASIK showed good response topical steroid therapy The patient concerned present case showed clinical serologic signs connective tissue disorder There evidence meibomitis blepharitis history Staphylococcal marginal keratitis Although surgery routine displayed acute symptoms day operation The infiltrate appeared multiple round shapes following flap margin epithelial defects These findings rule possibility infectious keratitis The patient 05 moxifloxacin eye drops asked consult The patient respond antibiotic immediately performed flap lifting antibiotics irrigation infiltration soon appeared progressed limbus outside flap We added topical steroids treatment starting second day operation patient showed response Several points suggest sterile infiltrate absence conjunctival injection ciliary flush absence epithelial defects surrounding edema absence anterior chamber reaction response steroids The infiltrate showed response intensive topical corticosteroid therapy cleared completely mild negligible regression eyes followup As case study achieved good results case topical steroid therapy From fact symptoms improved additional steroid therapy immune reaction inflammatory reaction acceptable cause infection ruled completely widerange antibiotics continuously Although exact mechanism complication entity recognition remains unclear 174 differentiation infectious keratitis essential management patients Appropriate early management usually results rapid disappearance infiltrates affecting final outcome Nevertheless important maintain high degree suspicion infectious keratitis management different potential outcome worse keratitis infectious etiology One perform culture treat cases empirically infectious 24 36 hours If cultures come negative start topical systemic steroids8 In conclusion look confusion infectious keratitis sterile keratitis case addressed LASIKinduced bilateral peripheral infiltrative keratitis
