based study drawn probability based internet panel 100 000 Israelis Participants Adults aged 18 years representative adult Israeli population The participants measured time points time 1 T1 pre second lockdown N1029 response rate7617 time 2 T2 post second lockdown N764 response rate7424 Main outcome measures Trajectories anxiety adjustment disorder based clinical cut score probable diagnoses T1 T2 somatic symptoms T2 The trajectories stable low probable diagnosis stable high stable probable diagnosis exacerbation probable diagnosis T1 probable diagnosis T2 recovery probable diagnosis T1 probable diagnosis T2 Results Three anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms stable high OR6451 exacerbation OR5379 recovery OR2025 compared stable low trajectory The adjustment disorder trajectories predicted somatic symptoms stable high OR4726 exacerbation OR6419 recovery OR4666 compared stable low trajectory Conclusions Our data elevated somatic symptoms mental health trajectories poor exacerbated recovered following second lockdown The presentation somatic symptoms mask psychological vulnerabilities appear recovered stressor This indicates lockdown double edged sword carefully administered given populations vulnerabilities INTRODUCTION From mental health perspective COVID19 pandemic viewed highly stressful event likely lead anxiety stress related disorders1 Particularly inter esting specific stressors associated Strengths limitations study To knowledge study address association mental health trajectories somatic symptoms second lockdown The survey robust

information online format30 However benefits come price tag selection bias Selection bias reduced probability panels countries high internet pene tration high mobile connectivity Using online survey

To sum COVID19 pandemic online surveys proved value collecting medical mental health data While problem selection bias exists benefits potential solutions reduce bias justifying use online surveys Limitations The findings study considered light limitations The foremost selec tion bias However probability based internet panel weighted dynamically adjusted meet Israeli Bureau Statistics terms age sex country high internet penetration mobile connections way reduce selection bias Second random stratified sampling preferable comparison quota sampling use robust quota sampling enables high response rate based probability based internet panel Israeli internet user population This highly valuable longitudinal designs Contrary use random stratified sampling tends yield lower response rates A previous study based probability based internet panel random stratification sampling led 3100 response rate16 versus 7617 response rate current study We note probability sampling low response rate suffers potential bias non probability sampling enjoys clear advantage quota sampling31 Study design considerations related probability panels real time assessments potentially reduce bias increase rigour online surveys Moreover quota sampling reflects general popu lation deployed time constraints exist lockdowns COVID19 pandemic Using strati fied random samples second lockdown lead miss time
