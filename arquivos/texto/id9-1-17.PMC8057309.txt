PLA General Hospital Beijing 100039 China 3 National Clinical Research Center Infectious Diseases Beijing 100039 China Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 major global public health pandemic China ﬁrst country epidemic situation quickly identiﬁed report pathogen released novel coronavirus gene sequence globally Thus China played essential role global ﬁght COVID19 Since outbreak epidemic Chinese government citizens pursued robust prevention control measures including wearing masks hand hygiene social distancing Largescale nucleic acid testing fully implemented resulted early detection reporting quarantine treatment Chinas epidemic situation generally brought control fatality rate effectively controlled14 Recently sporadic cases COVID19 China Of locally transmitted cases reported January 20 2021 68 reported Heilongjiang 33 Jilin 20 Hebei Beijing Shanxi Shandong National Health Commission reported5 For COVID19 medical treatment National Health Commission State Administration Traditional Chinese Medicine organized national experts infection respira tory intensive medicine pediatrics traditional Chinese medicine revise seventh edition Chinas diagnosis treatment plan The appointed national experts summarized prior clinical experience referred diagnosis treatment guidelines WHO countries produce eighth edition diagnosis treatment COVID196 Currently updated interpre tation follows I Epidemiological characteristics Asymptomatic infected individuals patients recognized important source infection Current research shown asymptomatic similarly Corresponding authors

treatment infectivity insidious In regard largescale active nucleic acid screening essential means eliminate potential transmission asymptom atic effective measure clinical practice Moreover following novel coronavirus infection infectivity incubation period similar onset illness statement infectivity occurs incubation period highly infectious ﬁve days onset illness added During incubation period transmission risk control key quickly control epidemic Therefore monitoring mobility highrisk population actively nucleic acid detection effective ways eliminate risk latent infection Imported frozen food outer packaging tested positive SARSCoV2 nucleic acid added transmission route included contact viruscontami nated items cause infection reminder epidemiological information paid attention clinical diagnosis Furthermore regular nucleic acid screening employees detect infected persons early help control transmission spread II Pathological characteristics The new guidelines update pathological characteristics COVID19 Anatomical features microscopic ﬁndings main affected organs lungs spleen hilar lymph nodes bone marrow heart blood vessels liver gallbladder kidneys brain tissue esophagus stomach intestinal mucosa testes described provides basis understanding clinical manifestations therapeutic interventions COVID19 For example characteristics extensive thrombosis provide basis clinical anti coagulation therapy decrease lymphocytes spleen lymph nodes consistent appearance peripheral blood provides basis clinical immuno logical intervention III Clinical characteristics 1 Clinical manifestations A new guideline adds patients decrease loss smell taste ﬁrst symptom Since decrease smell 17 Wang et al Infectious Diseases Immunity 202111 wwwidicmaorg chief taste common upper respiratory diseases complaint neglected carefully questioned Simultaneously small number patients central nervous involvement avascular necrosis extremities manifestations prompting clinicians pay attention monitoring intervention conscious ness change coagulation mechanisms A multisystem inﬂammatory syndrome children MISC reported countries worldwide clinical manifestations MISC generalized new guideline Thus clinicians aware new addition 2 Laboratory examination The updated guidelines added SARSCoV2speciﬁc IgM IgG antibodies low positive rate 1 week onset It suggested patients clinically suspected COVID19 convalescence negative nucleic acid result diagnosed antibody test offset falsenegative nucleic acid result IV Diagnostic criteria Given possibility false negative nucleic acid detection strengthen screening cases effectively control epidemic situation clear epidemiological history meet clinical manifestations positive novel coronavirus speciﬁc IgM antibody added suspected cases However attention paid falsepositive results IgM antibody test V Clinical classiﬁcation The diagnostic criteria severe cases adults children appropriately modiﬁed For example ordinary patients experience fever respiratory symptoms appearance pneumonia image VI Criteria highrisk severe critical cases The people identiﬁed highrisk severe critical cases follows 1 elderly people age 65 2 Patients cardiovascular cerebrovascular diseases including hypertension chronic lung diseases chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease moderate severe asthma diabetes tumors primary chronic liver kidney diseases diseases 3 Immunodeﬁciency AIDS patients people treated chronic use corticosteroids immunosuppressive drugs 4 Obesity BMI 30 5 Women trimester pregnancy perinatal period 6 Heavy smokers Thus identifying highrisk groups provides basis early clinical intervention For highrisk patients active disease observation timely oxygen therapy needed reduce risk disease progression It crucial discern signs severe critical cases transfer patients ICU time minimize fatality rate VII Severecritical early warning indicators adults children Through analysis summary large number cases studies shown indicators predict occurrence severecritical cases lymphocyte count inﬂammation indicators It worth noting indicators differ children adults provides evidence early clinical In addition indicators lactate dehydrogenase level troponin warning indicators In clinical practice necessary dynamically monitor patient discover changes disease timely intervention quickly transfer patients ICU treatment intervention VIII Discovery reporting cases In clinical practice suspected cases negative nucleic acid detection falsenegative results nucleic acid detection SARSCoV2 infection ruled patients Therefore patients excluded COVID19 diagnosis nucleic acid test results suspected cases negative consecutive novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests sampling time 24 hours apart ii speciﬁc IgM IgG antibodies remain negative seven days onset This information provides criteria exclusion suspected cases avoiding problem indeﬁnite detention IX Treatment 1 Antiviral therapy Currently recognized speciﬁc antiviral drugs Some antiviral drugs safety data reserved clinical trial use treatment pneumonia patients COVID 19 However necessity randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled studies emphasized Lopinavir ritonavir ribavirin hydroxychloroquine azithro mycin combination clearly recommended 2 Glucocorticoid therapy A low dose hormone short course treatment recommended patients progressive deterioration oxygenation index rapid imaging progression excessive activation inﬂammatory reaction 3 Treatment severe critical patients 1 The timely assessment improvement respiratory distress andor hypoxemia performed If signs improvement additional respiratory support measures taken The treatment prone position ventilation emphasized patients receiving oxygen therapy If complications prone position ventilation awake prone position simultaneously recommended The treatment time prone position 12 hours 2 The contents related airway management added include initiation timing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO indications ECMO mode selection recommended initial setting ECMO 3 Indications preventive anticoagulant therapy added event thromboembolic event anticoagulant therapy administered appropriate guidelines 18 Wang et al Infectious Diseases Immunity 202111 wwwidicmaorg 4 Principles treatment MISC added usage intravenous gamma globulin IVIG glucocorti coids aspirin 4 Early rehabilitation Because pulmonary ﬁbrosis occur COVID19 patients severe pneumonia patients generally emotional states anxiety tension recommended pay attention early rehabilitation intervention patients actively carry rehabilitation training intervention respiratory function physical function psychological dysfunction patients pneumonia COVID19 restore physical ﬁtness physique immunity mental health possible 5 Treatment Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM TCM plays important role treatment pneumonia COVID19 patients The eighthedition guidelines reﬁned TCM treatment principle based syndrome differentiation highlighted drugs schemes clinical treatment X Nursing The nursing criticallyill patients vital link improve prognosis Therefore nursing added eighth edition guidelines stressed importance closely monitoring vital signs state consciousness emphasizing oxygen saturation severecritical patients COVID19 Nursing necessary prevent pressure injury bedridden patients strengthen prevention manage ment pressure injury prone ventilation patients Moreover reducing nosocomial infection key decreasing critically ill patients mortality rate prevention control hospital infection XI Prevention The eighthedition guidelines suggested good personal environmental hygiene improve health literacy adequate indoor ventilation perform personal protection
