coeliac ganglion late adult old rats 10 weeks post jection alternative explanations likely Furthermore rats followed 20 weeks insufficient time developing clinical pic ture including neurodegeneration substantia nigra important CNS nuclei Further studies longterm fol lowup elaborate motor symptom testing required vestigate neurodegeneration brain subsequent motor deficits Additionally investigated time points study Extra intermediate time points beneficial map braintogut guttobrain propagation meticulously Finally opted use 10 different experimental groups maximize control experimental variables This use aged animals resulted small sample sizes Because binary nature immunohistochemical data lack pathology extensive pathology able obtain statistically significant differences groups Conclusion Nearly published reports Parkinsons disease wildtype models young animals reported minimal propaga tion asyn pathology Our results highlight ageing wise healthy animals substantially promotes development asyn pathology crucial complete propagation heart skin like observed human Parkinsons disease Given age greatest risk factor human Parkinsons disease likely older experimental animals yield relevant reliable findings findings young animals probably accurate reflection human Parkinsons disease Although asyn pathology widespread CNS PNS neuronal degeneration restricted
