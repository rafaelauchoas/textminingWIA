ensembles aim overcome errors individual classiﬁers combining different classiﬁcation instances obtain better result classiﬁer amended ﬁnal result ensemble However ensemble represents bottomup mapping classiﬁcation invariably fails certain level distortion data The interpretation understanding complex usually unfolds set abstraction layers layer temporal granularity representation reduced A classiﬁcation strategy provides interpretation result connecting set classiﬁers abstraction structure monotonicity deduction entails propagation errors ﬁrst abstraction layers upwards narrowing capability making proper interpretation new abstraction layers successively added Following abductive process instead observation conjectured abstraction layer best explanatory hypothesis data layer

As consequence abduction guess underlying processes corrupted data temporary absence data On hand classiﬁer based assumption underlying processes mechanisms mutually exclusive Superpositions processes excluded represented new process corresponding new category different usually unrelated previous ones Therefore artiﬁcial casuistrybased heuristics adopted increasing complexity interpretation reducing adaptability variability observations In contrast abduction reach conclusion availability partial evidence reﬁning result incremental addition new information This makes possible discern
