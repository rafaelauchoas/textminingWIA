extrem ities example Prof Raymond Malcolm Smith wellknown expert Harvard Medical School pointed key points handling Moreover example external ﬁxation shown The open fractures characteristics easy contamina tion frequent highenergy injury heavy tissue damage hard manage Prof Smith proposed principles surgery open fracture debridement lavage fracture stabilization soft tissue closure He believed early treatment important greatly reduce risk infection Comprehensive evaluation wound accurate thorough debridement lavage prevention postoperative complications infection indispensable treatment Although believes postoperative ﬁxation avoided better healing clinical experimental evidences shown postoperative ﬁxation plays positive role wound healing In review Prof Smith team introduced different ﬁxation methods different wound patterns speed healing process Whether treat combined triangular ligament injury ankle fractures controversial Professor Lei Liu West China Hospi tal reported open reduction internal ﬁxation transarticular external ﬁxation effective triangular lig ament repair rotation type IV equivalent ankle fractures Mean wound management convenient The treatment open fractures controversial We believe review Professor Smith summarizes recent advanced clinical techniques suggests appropriate surgical methods based authors years clinical experience proposed principles open fracture care provide valuable clinical advice majority clinicians Sepsis Issue 6 Sepsis common complication severe trauma burn injury shock major operation cause septic shock mul

However standard procedure ﬂuid resuscitation Prof PengLin Ma pro posed ﬁve protocols 1 Evaluate ﬂuid electrolyte status critically ill patients 2 Make normal saline NS infusion management plan 3 Measure rate volume NS mark 4 Rs 4 Record sources ﬂuid electrolyte intake 5 Write information patients family members The mechanism sepsis unknown Although updating Surviving Sepsis Campaign
