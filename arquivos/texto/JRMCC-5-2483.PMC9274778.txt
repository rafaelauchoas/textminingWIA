particularize reduction pain obtained knee braces improvement self reported pain symptoms 54 respondents knee brace Thirty percent respondents reported pain symptoms changed significantly sig

The mobility level patients mobility range grea ter 50 m high average 85 respon dents indicating high level mobility knee brace When comparing new users 88 repeat users 84 significant difference These results support findings Van Dijk et al Pisters et al showed limitations activities fairly stable 3 years followup 24 25 However selfreported limitation mobility knee brace reported higher repeat

methods depends disease condition mood physical activities ultima tely score provided patients Although met hods accepted clinicians possible use quantify morphological biomechanical changes soft tissue regions Therefore cautious making assumptions pre dictive value long shortterm effects based overall physical activity subject Many patients compensate knee instability increasing muscle activation cocontraction knee joint This provides stable feeling progressive effect knee OA increased pressure knee joint Wearing stabilizing rigid knee brace ensures reduction muscle cocontraction pain 27 With reported pain reduction 54 possible users wearing knee braces study cocon traction indicate reduced progression knee OA Further research needed confirm finding The use pain medications assessed study use analgesics influenced results Although expected patients use pain medication knee braces research include information investigate reduction pain In addition 9 patients experience improvements knee brace experienced deterioration While factors correct knee brace fitting overcompensation muscles additional injuries play role research required understand outcomes CONCLUSION This largescale PROM study effectiveness use semirigid knee braces patients knee OA shows use brace contributes general daily functioning reduces pain increases possibility JRMCC 2022 Vol 5 JRMCC p 7 7
