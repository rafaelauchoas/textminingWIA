model agents relative importance agents ability inﬂuence group decision directly proportional weight For example quota high winning coalition involves agents agent veto decision agents equal power Thus measure power instead agents weights typically employs socalled power indices Perhaps prominent ones ShapleyShubik index 41 Banzhaf index 116 Intuitively indices measure probability given agent
