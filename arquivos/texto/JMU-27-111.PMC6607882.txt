Hung1 KeVin Chang12 Dear Editor A 40yearold female modern dancer presented pain tenderness lateral aspect left hip 6 months The pain initially noticed performance aggravated making difficult perform certain dancing postures During physical examination specific tender point palpated left lateral iliac crest IC Figure 1a The ultrasound US examination revealed focal swelling hypoechoic proximal gluteus medius GMed attachment IC Figure 1b c Proximal GMed tendinopathy impressed USguided percutaneous needle tenotomy PNT injection hypertonic dextrose prolotherapy performed lesion times 1month
