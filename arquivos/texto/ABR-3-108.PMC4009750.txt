Background Basal cell carcinoma BCC common cutaneous neoplasm human beings Ultraviolet radiation important predisposing factors BCC Although recent investigations shown high serum level phospholipids actinic keratosis BCC subject debated needs approval This study aimed evaluate association serum lipid level development cutaneous BCC Materials Methods In casecontrol study lipid profile including triglyceride TG Cholesterol CHOL highdensity lipoprotein HDL lowdensity lipoprotein LDL measured 30 patients BCC 30 healthy controls Data analyzed descriptive statistical tests including t tests Chi

serum phospholipid levels significantly higher AK group They concluded increase metabolically active serum phospholipids fraction reflected elevated neoplastic tissue phospholipids Another study performed patients malignancies revealed total lipids cholesterol HDL cholesterol levels inversely associated incidence cancer triglyceride levels significantly elevated patients cancer11 Chawda et al inverse relationship lipid levels occurrence oral cancer concluding lower plasma lipid concentrations useful indicator detecting initial changes observed neoplastic processes9 Microscopic changes

antioxidant defense mechanisms13 Lipid contents daily diet including lipidsoluble vitamins studied BCC pathology It shown plasma antioxidants decreased precancerous lesions AK BCC probably long exposure UV irradiation important factors etiology AK BCC αtocopherol RBC glutathione altered BCC13 Heinen et al surprisingly showed dietary intake antioxidants like vitamin C vitamin E associated increased BCC risk14 But Van Dam et al reported intake longchain3 fatty acids retinol vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E materially related BCC risk15 Also Hunter et al16 showed significant association risk BCC energyadjusted intake dietary fat carotenoids vitamin A activity retinol vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E supplements One limitation study patients BCC included cases We consider preneoplastic lesions AK Special forms BCC nevoid BCC syndrome presents multiple lesions early ages information different lipid profile changes We follow sample changes recurrence period Further studies large
