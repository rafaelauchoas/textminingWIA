Abstract

Dempster’s rule plays a central role in the theory of belief functions. However, it assumes the combined bodies of evidence to
be distinct, an assumption which is not always veriﬁed in practice. In this paper, a new operator, the cautious rule of combination,
is introduced. This operator is commutative, associative and idempotent. This latter property makes it suitable to combine belief
functions induced by reliable, but possibly overlapping bodies of evidence. A dual operator, the bold disjunctive rule, is also
introduced. This operator is also commutative, associative and idempotent, and can be used to combine belief functions issues
from possibly overlapping and unreliable sources. Finally, the cautious and bold rules are shown to be particular members of
inﬁnite families of conjunctive and disjunctive combination rules based on triangular norms and conorms.

1. Introduction

Dempster’s rule of combination [3,28] is known to play a pivotal role in the theory of belief functions, together
with its unnormalized version introduced by Smets in the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) [30], hereafter referred to
as the TBM conjunctive rule. Justiﬁcations for the origins and uniqueness of these rules have been provided by several
authors [8,21,22,30]. However, although they appear well founded theoretically, the need for greater ﬂexibility through
a larger choice of combination rules has been recognized by many researchers involved in real-world applications.
Two limitations of Dempster’s rule and its unnormalized version seem to be their lack of robustness with respect
to conﬂicting evidence (a criticism which mainly applies to Dempster’s rule), and the requirement that the items of
evidence combined be distinct.

The issue of conﬂict management has been addressed by several authors, who proposed alternative rules which,
unfortunately, are generally not associative (see, e.g., [11,25,40], and reviews in [27] and [37]). The disjunctive rule
of combination [9,31] (hereafter referred to as the TBM disjunctive rule) is both associative and more robust than
Dempster’s rule in the presence of conﬂicting evidence, and its use is appropriate when the conﬂict is due to poor

reliability of some of the sources. It may also be argued that problems with Dempster’s rule (and, to a lesser extent,
with the TBM conjunctive rule) are often due to incorrect or incomplete modelisation of the problem at hand, and that
these rules often yield reasonable results when they are properly applied [17]. In [37], an expert system approach is
advocated in case of large conﬂict, to determine its origin and revise the underlying hypotheses accordingly.

The other, and perhaps more fundamental, limitation of Dempster’s rule lies in the assumption that the items of evi-
dence combined be distinct or, in other words, that the information sources be independent. As remarked by Dempster
[3], the real-world meaning of this notion is difﬁcult to describe. The general idea is that, in the combination process,
no elementary item of evidence should be counted twice. Thus, nonoverlapping random samples from a population
are clearly distinct items of evidence, whereas “opinions of different people based on overlapping experiences could
not be regarded as independent sources” [3]. When the nature of the interaction between items of evidence can be
described mathematically, then it is possible to extend Dempster’s rule or the TBM conjunctive rule so as to include
this knowledge (see, e.g., [8,29]). However, it is often the case that, although two items of evidence (such as, e.g.,
opinions expressed by two experts sharing some experiences, or observations of correlated random quantities) can
clearly not be regarded as distinct, the interaction between them is ill known and, in many cases, almost impossible to
describe.

In such a common situation, it would be very helpful to have a combination rule that would not rely on the distinct-
ness assumption. An early attempt to provide such a rule is reported in [26], but it was limited to the combination of
simple belief functions (i.e., belief functions having at most two focal sets, including the frame of discernment). This
method was extended to separable belief functions (i.e., belief functions that can be decomposed as the conjunctive
sum of simple belief functions) in [15]. However, not all belief functions are separable, and the justiﬁcation for this
approach was unclear.

A natural requirement for a rule allowing the combination of overlapping bodies of evidence is idempotence. The
arithmetic mean does possess this property, but it is not associative, another requirement often regarded as essential.
Following an approach initiated by Dubois and Prade in [8], Cattaneo [1] studied a family of rules generalizing the
TBM conjunctive rule, based on the deﬁnition of a joint belief function on a product space, whose marginals are the
belief functions to be combined. Inside this family, he proposed a rule minimizing the conﬂict, which happens to be
idempotent. However, he showed that, within this particular family of rules, associativity is incompatible both with
idempotency, and with conﬂict minimization.

In contrast, associative and idempotent operators exist in possibility theory, based on the minimum triangular norm
and its dual, the maximum triangular conorm. Dubois and Yager [14] showed that aggregation operators for possibility
distributions (or, equivalently, fuzzy set connectives) can be deduced from assumptions on multi-valued mappings
underlying the possibility distributions viewed as consonant belief functions. This approach, however, has not made
it possible to extend possibilistic aggregation operators to arbitrary belief functions while maintaining such properties
as associativity and idempotency. New operators satisfying these properties are proposed in this paper, following a
completely different approach based on some ideas suggested to the author by the late Philippe Smets [35].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The underlying fundamental concepts, including the canonical de-
composition and the relative information content of belief functions, are ﬁrst recalled in Section 2. The cautious
conjunctive rule and its dual, the bold disjunctive rule are then introduced in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The cau-
tious and bold rules are shown in Section 5 to be particular members of inﬁnite families of conjunctive and disjunctive
combination rules based on triangular norms and conorms. Finally, the efﬁciency of the cautious rule to combine
information from dependent features in a classiﬁer fusion problem is demonstrated experimentally in Section 6, and
Section 7 concludes the paper.

2. Fundamental concepts

In this section, the main building blocks of new combination rules deﬁned later are introduced. The basic con-
cepts and terminology related to belief functions are ﬁrst summarized in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 then focuses on the
canonical conjunctive decomposition of nondogmatic belief functions, which allows their representation in the form
of conjunctive weight functions taking values in (0, +∞). This section is essential, as the cautious conjunctive rule
introduced in this paper will be expressed as a function of conjunctive weights. Finally, Section 2.3 recalls known
deﬁnitions and results related to the ordering of belief functions according to their information content; a new partial

236

ordering relation based on conjunctive weights is also introduced. This ordering relation will play an important role
in the derivation of the new combination rules.

2.1. Basic deﬁnitions and notations

In this paper, the TBM [33,38] is accepted as a model of uncertainty. An agent’s state of belief expressed on a ﬁnite
frame of discernment Ω = {ω1, . . . , ωK } is represented by a basic belief assignment (BBA) m, deﬁned as a mapping
from 2Ω to [0, 1] verifying
A⊆Ω m(A) = 1. Subsets A of Ω such that m(A) > 0 are called focal sets of m. A BBA
m is said to be

(cid:2)

• normal if ∅ is not a focal set (this condition is not imposed in the TBM);
• subnormal is ∅ is a focal set;
• dogmatic if Ω is not a focal set;
• vacuous if Ω is the only focal set;
• simple if it has at most two focal sets and, if it has two, Ω is one of those;
• categorical if it has only one focal set;
• Bayesian if its focal sets are singletons.

A subnormal BBA m can be transformed into a normal BBA m∗ by the normalization operation deﬁned as follows:

A simple BBA (SBBA) m such that m(A) = 1 − w for some A (cid:6)= Ω and m(Ω) = w can be noted Aw (the
advantage of this notation will become apparent later). The vacuous BBA can thus be noted A1 for any A ⊂ Ω, and a
categorical BBA can be noted A0 for some A (cid:6)= Ω. A BBA m can equivalently be represented by its associated belief,
implicability, plausibility and commonality functions deﬁned, respectively, as:

(cid:3)

∗
m

(A) =

k · m(A)
if A (cid:6)= ∅,
0
otherwise,
for all A ⊆ Ω, with k = (1 − m(∅))−1.

(cid:4)

bel(A) =

m(B),

∅(cid:6)=B⊆A

(cid:4)

m(B) = bel(A) + m(∅),

b(A) =

B⊆A

(cid:4)

pl(A) =

m(B),

B∩A(cid:6)=∅

and

q(A) =

(cid:4)

B⊇A

m(B),

for all A ⊆ Ω. BBA m can be recovered from any of these functions. For instance:

m(A) =

and

m(A) =

(−1)

|B|−|A|

q(B),

∀A ⊆ Ω,

(−1)

|A|−|B|

b(B),

∀A ⊆ Ω,

(cid:4)

B⊇A

(cid:4)

B⊆A

where |A| denotes the cardinality of A.

The negation (or complement) m of a BBA m is deﬁned as the BBA verifying m(A) = m(A) for all A ⊆ Ω, where
A denotes the complement of A [9]. It may easily be shown that the implicability function b associated to m and the
commonality function q associated to m are linked by the following relation:

b(A) = q(A),

∀A ⊆ Ω.

A BBA m is said to be consonant if its focal sets are nested. This is known to be equivalent to the following

condition [28]:

pl(A ∪ B) = pl(A) ∨ pl(B),

∀A, B ⊆ Ω,

where ∨ denote the maximum operator. The above equation deﬁnes a possibility measure [41]. Consequently, a
consonant BBA uniquely deﬁnes a possibility measure. The corresponding possibility distribution is then given by

π(ω) = pl

∀ω ∈ Ω.

Given a BBA m and a coefﬁcient α ∈ [0, 1], the discounting of m with discount rate α yields the new BBA αm

deﬁned by:

αm = (1 − α)m + αmΩ ,

where mΩ denotes the vacuous BBA [28, p. 252]. The discounting operation is used to model a situation where a
source S provides a BBA m, and the reliability of S is measured by 1 − α. If S is fully reliable (1 − α = 1), then m
is left unchanged. If S is not reliable at all, m is transformed into the vacuous BBA. In intermediate situations, m is
replaced by a convex combination of m and the vacuous BBA.

The TBM conjunctive rule and Dempster’s rule are noted ∩(cid:14) and ⊕, respectively. They are deﬁned as follows. Let

m1 and m2 be two BBAs, and let m1 ∩(cid:14)2 and m1⊕2 be the result of their combination by ∩(cid:14) and ⊕. We have:

m1 ∩(cid:14)2(A) =

m1(B)m2(C),

∀A ⊆ Ω,

(cid:4)

B∩C=A

(cid:7)

and, assuming that m1 ∩(cid:14)2(∅) (cid:6)= 1:

m1⊕2(A) =

0

m1 ∩(cid:14)2(A)
1−m1 ∩(cid:14)2(∅)

if A = ∅,
otherwise.

(9)

(10)

Dempster’s rule is just equivalent to the TBM conjunctive rule followed by normalization using (1). Both rules are
commutative, associative, and admit a unique neutral element: the vacuous BBA. They both assume the combined
items of evidence to be distinct. Let Aw1 and Aw2 be two SBBAs with the same focal element A (cid:6)= Ω. The result
of their ∩(cid:14)-combination is the SBBA Aw1w2 . The ⊕ operator yields the same result as long as A (cid:6)= ∅. The TBM
conjunctive rule has a simple expression in terms of commonality functions: with obvious notations, we have:

q1 ∩(cid:14)2 = q1 · q2.

(11)

In the TBM, conditioning by B ⊆ Ω is equivalent to conjunctive combination with a categorical BBA mB focused
on B. The result is noted m[B], with m[B] = m ∩(cid:14) mB . This conditional BBA quantiﬁes our belief on Ω, in a context
where B holds.

Let us now assume that m1 ∩(cid:14)2 has been obtained by combining two BBAs m1 and m2, and then we learn that
m2 is in fact not supported by evidence and should be “removed” from m1 ∩(cid:14)2. This “decombination” operation was
introduced in [32]. It is well deﬁned if m2 is nondogmatic. Denoting (cid:6)∩(cid:14) this operator, we can write:

m1 ∩(cid:14)2 (cid:6)∩(cid:14) m2 = m1.

Decombination can easily be computed for any two BBAs m1 and m2 using the corresponding commonality functions
as:

q1 (cid:6)∩(cid:14)2(A) = q1(A)
q2(A)

,

∀A ⊆ Ω.

(12)

Note that q2(A) > 0 for all A as long as m2 is nondogmatic. One should also be aware that the quotient of two
commonality functions is not always a commonality function. Consequently, m1 (cid:6)∩(cid:14) m2 is not necessarily a BBA.

A disjunctive rule of combination ∪(cid:14) also exists [9,31]: it is deﬁned as

m1 ∪(cid:14)2(A) =

m1(B)m2(C),

∀A ⊆ Ω.

(13)

(cid:4)

B∪C=A

238

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

This rule, called the TBM disjunctive rule, is also commutative and associative. It has a simple expression in terms of
implicability functions, which is the counterpart of (11):

b1 ∪(cid:14)2 = b1 · b2.

As for the TBM conjunctive rule, an inverse operation may also be deﬁned for the TBM disjunctive rule:

b1 (cid:6)∪(cid:14)2(A) = b1(A)
b2(A)

,

∀A ⊆ Ω.

(14)

(15)

This operation is well-deﬁned as long as m2 is subnormal (in which case we have b2(A) > 0 for all A). However, it
does not necessarily produce a belief function. Its interpretation is similar to that of (cid:6)∩(cid:14): it removes, or “decombines,”
evidence which has been combined disjunctively with prior knowledge.

The dual nature of ∩(cid:14) and ∪(cid:14) becomes apparent when one notices that these two operators are linked by De

Morgan’s laws [9]:

m1 ∪(cid:14) m2 = m1 ∩(cid:14) m2,
m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 = m1 ∪(cid:14) m2,

for all m1 and m2.

(16)

(17)

As remarked by Smets [31], the TBM conjunctive rule is based on the assumption that the belief functions to be
combined are induced by reliable sources of information, whereas the TBM disjunctive rule only assume that at least
one source of information is reliable, but we do not know which one. Both rules assume the sources of information to
be independent (i.e., they are assumed to provide distinct, nonoverlapping pieces of evidence).

In the TBM, combination rules belong to the credal level where evidence aggregation takes place, whereas deci-
sions are made at the pignistic level [38], where each BBA m is mapped to a pignistic probability function Betpm
deﬁned by

(cid:4)

Betpm(ω) =

m∗(A)
|A|

{A: ω∈A}
where m∗ denotes the normalized version of m.

,

∀ω ∈ Ω,

(18)

2.2. Canonical conjunctive decomposition of a belief function

Shafer [28, Chapter 4] deﬁned a separable BBA as the result of the ⊕ combination of SBBAs. For every separable

BBA in the sense of Shafer, one has:

(cid:8)

m =

Aw(A),

(19)

∅(cid:6)=A⊂Ω

with w(A) ∈ [0, 1] for all A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅. This representation is unique if m is nondogmatic. Shafer named this
representation the canonical decomposition of m.

The concept of separability can be extended to subnormal BBAs in two ways:

• We will say that a BBA m is u-separable (where “u” stands for “unnormalized”) if we have

m = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw(A),

with w(A) ∈ [0, 1] for all A ⊂ Ω.

(cid:8)

∗ =

m

Aw(A),

• We will say that a BBA m is n-separable (where “n” stands for “normalized”) if we have

(20)

(21)

∅(cid:6)=A⊂Ω

where w(A) ∈ [0, 1] for all A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅, and m∗ is the normalized form of m.

Again, the decompositions (20) and (21) are unique as long as m is nondogmatic. Clearly, (20) implies (21), but the
converse is not true, as will be shown below. Consequently, u-separability is a stronger notion than n-separability.

2.2.1. Extension to nondogmatic BBAs

The canonical decomposition of a separable BBA was extended to any nondogmatic BBA by Smets [32]. The key
to such a generalization is the notion of generalized simple BBA (GSBBA), deﬁned as a function μ from 2Ω to R
verifying

μ(A) = 1 − w,
μ(Ω) = w,
μ(B) = 0 ∀B ∈ 2Ω \ {A, Ω},

(24)
for some A (cid:6)= Ω and some w ∈ [0, +∞). Any GSBBA μ can thus be noted Aw for some A (cid:6)= Ω and w ∈ [0, +∞).
When w (cid:2) 1, μ is a SBBA. When w > 1, μ is not a BBA, since it is no longer a mapping from 2Ω to [0, 1]. Such a
function can be referred to as an inverse simple BBA (ISBBA), using a terminology similar to that used in [32]. The
TBM conjunctive rule can be trivially extended to combine SBBAs and ISBBAs alike. In particular, the relationship
Aw1 ∩(cid:14) Aw2 = Aw1w2 still holds for w1, w2 ∈ [0, +∞).

In [32], Smets proposed an interpretation of an ISBBA as representing a state of belief in which one has some
reasons not to believe in A. By combining Aw for some w > 1 with the SBBA A1/w using the TBM conjunctive rule,
one obtains the vacuous bba A1. Hence, the ISBBA Aw corresponds to a situation where the agent has a “debt of
belief” in A, and some evidence has to be accumulated before it starts to believe in A.

Using the concept of GSBBA, and extending Shafer’s approach, Smets showed that any nondogmatic BBA can be

uniquely represented as the conjunctive combination of GSBBAs:

m = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw(A),

(25)

with w(A) ∈ (0, +∞) for all A ⊂ Ω. Eq. (25) is clearly an extension of (19). It deﬁnes the canonical conjunctive
decomposition of m (we will see in Section 4.1 that a canonical disjunctive decomposition also exists). The weights
w(A) for every A ⊂ Ω can be obtained from the commonalities using the following formula:

(cid:9)

w(A) =

q(B)(−1)|B|−|A|+1

if |A| ∈ 2N,

otherwise,

where 2N denotes the set of even natural numbers. Eq. (26) can be equivalently written

One notices the similarity with (6). Hence, any procedure for transforming q to m (such as the Fast Möbius Transform
[20] or matrix multiplication [34]) can be used to compute ln w from − ln q.

The function w : 2Ω \ {Ω} → (0, +∞) (hereafter referred to as the conjunctive weight function) is thus yet another
equivalent representation of any nondogmatic BBA (together with bel, pl, q, etc.). This concept of conjunctive weight

function can be extended to a dogmatic BBA m by discounting it with some discount rate (cid:6) and letting (cid:6) tend towards
0 [32]. However, this extension requires some mathematical subtleties. Furthermore, it may be argued that most (if
not all) states of belief, being based on imperfect and not entirely conclusive evidence, should be represented by
nondogmatic belief functions, even if the mass m(Ω) is very small. For instance, consider a coin tossing experiment.
It is natural to deﬁne a BBA on Ω = {Heads, Tails} as m({Heads}) = 0.5 and m({Tails}) = 0.5. However, this assumes
the coin to be perfectly balanced, a condition never exactly veriﬁed in practice. So, a more appropriate BBA may be
m({Heads}) = 0.5(1 − (cid:6)), m({Tails}) = 0.5(1 − (cid:6)) and m(Ω) = (cid:6) for some small (cid:6) > 0.

Example 1. Let Ω = {a, b, c} be a frame of discernment, and m the BBA shown in Table 1. The weights can be
computed from the commonalities using (26) as follows:

We can see that m can be represented as the conjunctive combination of two SBBAs {a, b}2/5 and {b, c}2/7, and an

2.2.2. Special cases

In the following two propositions, we provide analytical formulas for the conjunctive weight functions associated

to two important classes of BBAs.

Proposition 1. Let A1, . . . , An be n subsets of Ω such that Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and let m be a BBA
(cid:2)
n
k=1 m(Ak) (cid:2) 1, so that ∅ may also be a focal
on Ω with focal sets A1, . . . , An, and Ω. We assume that m(Ω) +
set. The conjunctive weight function associated to m is:

⎧

w(A) =

A = Ak,

otherwise.

Proof. We have:
(cid:7)

q(A) =

m(Ak) + m(Ω), A ⊆ Ak,
A = ∅,
1,
m(Ω),
otherwise.

Consequently, m may be expressed as a function of q as follows:

m(Ak) = q(Ak) − q(Ω),
m(Ω) = q(Ω),

m(∅) = q(∅) − q(Ω) −

k = 1, . . . , n,

As explained above, ln w may be obtained from − ln q using any procedure that transforms q to m. Consequently,
we may, in the above equations, replace m by ln w and q by − ln q (except in (30), because w(Ω) is not deﬁned). We
obtain from (29):

ln w(Ak) = − ln q(Ak) + ln q(Ω) = ln

which implies

w(Ak) =

m(Ω)
m(Ak) + m(Ω)

The BBAs studied in Proposition 1 may be termed “quasi-Bayesian”, as they can be obtained by discounting
Bayesian BBAs deﬁned on a coarsening of Ω. This class of BBAs is closed under the TBM conjunctive rule. Quasi-
Bayesian BBAs are deﬁned by a small number of masses, and are frequently encountered in applications.

Another important case concerns consonant BBAs, whose focal sets are nested. The following proposition provides

formulas to compute the weight function associated to a consonant BBA.

Proposition 2. Let m be a consonant BBA, with associated possibility distribution π(ωk) = q({ωk}), k = 1, . . . , K.
We note πk = π(ωk) and we assume that the elements of Ω have been arranged in decreasing order of plausibility,
i.e., we have

1 (cid:3) π1 (cid:3) π2 (cid:3) · · · (cid:3) πK > 0.

Let Ak = {ω1, . . . , ωk}, k = 1, . . . , K. The focal sets of m are in {A1, . . . , AK , ∅} (m is subnormal if π1 < 1, and it is
nondogmatic since we have assumed πK > 0). The conjunctive weight function associated to m is:

w(A) =

2.2.3. Normalization and combination

It may be remarked that normalizing a subnormal BBA m using (1) amounts to combining it with the ISBBA ∅k:

∗ = m ∩(cid:14) ∅k.

m

Consequently, the weight function w∗ associated to m∗ is identical to w, except for the weight assigned to ∅. If
m = ∩(cid:14)

A⊂Ω Aw(A), we have
(cid:19)

∗ = ∅k ∩(cid:14) ∅w(∅) ∩(cid:14)

with w∗(∅) = k · w(∅) and w∗(A) = w(A) for all A ∈ 2Ω \ {∅, Ω}. We can write, equivalently:

∗ =

(cid:8)

∅(cid:6)=A⊂Ω

Aw(A).

(33)

As a direct consequence of the above remark, it is easy to formulate criteria for u-separability and n-separability:

• A BBA m is u-separable iff w(A) (cid:2) 1, for all A ⊂ Ω;
• A BBA m is n-separable iff w(A) (cid:2) 1, for all A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅.

For instance, quasi-Bayesian BBAs studied in Proposition 1 are n-separable, but they are not u-separable in general
(we may have w(∅) > 1). In contrast, consonant BBAs are u-separable, since they satisfy the condition w(A) (cid:2) 1 for
all A ⊂ Ω.

The w representation appears particularly interesting when it comes to combining BBAs using the TBM conjunc-

tive rule or Dempster’s rule. Indeed, let m1 and m2 be two BBAs with weight functions w1 and w2. We have:

m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 =

(cid:20)

(cid:19)

Aw1(A)

∩(cid:14)

(cid:19)

Aw2(A)

∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

(cid:20)

= ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw1(A)w2(A).

We can thus write, with obvious notations:

w1 ∩(cid:14)2 = w1 · w2,

(34)

(35)

which is reminiscent of (11). The inverse TBM conjunctive rule (cid:6)∩(cid:14) also has a simple expression in the w-space,
similar to (33): we have w1 (cid:6)∩(cid:14)2 = w1/w2. Hence,

m1 (cid:6)∩(cid:14) m2 =

(cid:20)

Aw1(A)/w2(A).

Finally, using (33), it is easy to see that
(cid:8)

m1 ⊕ m2 =

Aw1(A)w2(A).

∅(cid:6)=A⊂Ω

2.2.4. Latent belief structure

Let m be a nondogmatic belief function, and w its associated conjunctive weight function. For each weight w(A)

let us deﬁne the following two quantities:

wc(A) = 1 ∧ w(A),

and

wd (A) = 1 ∧ 1

w(A)

,

where ∧ denotes the minimum operator. It is clear that we have

w(A) = wc(A)
wd (A)

.

Consequently, we can write

Awc(A)/wd (A)

m = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω
(cid:19)
∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω
= mc (cid:6)∩(cid:14) md .

Any nondogmatic BBA m can thus be decomposed into two u-separable BBAs mc and md called, respectively, its
conﬁdence and difﬁdence components. The pair (mc, md ) forms what Smets called a latent belief structure (LBS) [32].
He proposed to interpret mc as representing positive evidence, i.e., good reasons to believe in various propositions
A ⊆ Ω, and md as representing negative evidence, i.e., good reasons not to believe in the same propositions. The BBA
m is obtained by removing the negative evidence md from the positive evidence mc. Note that we have the following
1, md
property with respect to the TBM conjunctive rule: if (mc

2.3. Informational comparison of belief functions

In the TBM, the Least Commitment Principle (LCP) plays a role similar to the principle of maximum entropy in
Bayesian Probability Theory. As explained in [31], the LCP indicates that, given two belief functions compatible with
a set of constraints, the most appropriate is the least informative. To make this principle operational, it is necessary
to deﬁne ways of comparing belief functions according to their information content. Three such partial orderings,
generalizing set inclusion, were proposed in the 1980s by Yager [39] and Dubois and Prade [9]; they are deﬁned as
follows:

• pl-ordering: m1 (cid:18)pl m2 iff pl1(A) (cid:2) pl2(A), for all A ⊆ Ω;
• q-ordering: m1 (cid:18)q m2 iff q1(A) (cid:2) q2(A), for all A ⊆ Ω;
• s-ordering: m1 (cid:18)s m2 iff there exists a square matrix S with general term S(A, B), A, B ∈ 2Ω verifying

(cid:4)

S(A, B) = 1,

∀A ⊆ Ω,

B⊆Ω
S(A, B) > 0 ⇒ A ⊆ B, A, B ⊆ Ω,

such that

m1(A) =

(cid:4)

B⊆Ω

S(A, B)m2(B),

∀A ⊆ Ω.

(45)

The term S(A, B) may be seen as the proportion of the mass m2(B) which is transferred (“ﬂows down”) to A.
Matrix S is named a specialization matrix [22,34], and m1 is said to be a specialization of m2.

244

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

As shown in [9], these three deﬁnitions are not equivalent: m1 (cid:18)s m2 implies m1 (cid:18)pl m2 and m1 (cid:18)q m2, but the
converse is not true. Additionally, pl-ordering and q-ordering are not comparable. However, in the set of consonant
BBAs, these three partial orders are equivalent. The interpretation of these ordering relations is discussed in [9] from
a set-theoretical perspective, and in [12] from the point of view of the TBM. Whenever we have m1 (cid:18)x m2, with
x ∈ {pl, q, s}, we will say that m1 is x-more committed than m2.

Another concept which leads to an alternative deﬁnition of informational ordering is that of Dempsterian special-
ization [22]. m1 is said to be a Dempsterian specialization of m2, which we note m1 (cid:18)d m2, iff there exists a BBA m
such that m1 = m ∩(cid:14) m2. As shown in [22], this is a stronger condition than specialization, i.e., we have m1 (cid:18)d m2 ⇒
m1 (cid:18)s m2, but the converse is false. If m1 = m ∩(cid:14) m2, then there is a specialization matrix Sm deﬁned as a function of
m, called a Dempsterian specialization matrix, allowing the computation of m1 from m2 using relation (45).

Finally, we can think of one more deﬁnition of informational ordering based on the weight function recalled in
Section 2.2: given two nondogmatic BBAs m1 and m2, we can say that m1 is w-more committed than m2, which
we note m1 (cid:18)w m2, iff w1(A) (cid:2) w2(A), for all A ⊂ Ω. Because of (35), this is equivalent to the existence of a u-
separable BBA m, with weight function w = w1/w2, such that m1 = m ∩(cid:14) m2. Consequently, w-ordering is strictly
stronger than d-ordering. The meaning of (cid:18)d and (cid:18)w is clear: if m1 (cid:18)d m2 or m1 (cid:18)w m2, it means that m1 is the
result of the combination of m2 with some BBA m; consequently, m1 has a higher information content than m2. In
the case of (cid:18)w, the requirement that m be u-separable may seem artiﬁcial. However, it may be argued that most belief
functions encountered in practice result from the pooling of simple evidence, and are therefore u-separable. As shown
in Section 2.2.2, this is also the case for consonant belief functions, a class of belief functions often encountered in
applications because of its simplicity. Furthermore, we will see that w-ordering happens to be a simpler and more
convenient notion, for some purposes, than other orderings. A slightly weaker notion based on n-separability will be
deﬁned later in Section 3.3. We defer the introduction of this additional notion for clarity of presentation.

In summary, we thus have, for any two nondogmatic BBAs m1 and m2:

(cid:3)

m1 (cid:18)w m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:18)d m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:18)s m2 ⇒

m1 (cid:18)pl m2,
m1 (cid:18)q m2,

(46)

where all implications are strict.

orderings (cid:18)x with x ∈ {pl, q, s, d}, i.e., we have

The vacuous BBA mΩ (with weight function wΩ (A) = 1, for all A ⊂ Ω) is the unique greatest element for partial

m (cid:18)x mΩ ,

∀m, ∀x ∈ {pl, q, s, d}.

In contrast, mΩ is only a maximal element for (cid:18)w, i.e., we have the following weaker property

mΩ (cid:18)w m ⇒ m = mΩ .

The BBAs that are w-less speciﬁc than mΩ are the u-separable ones. Non-u-separable BBAs are not comparable with
mΩ according to relation (cid:18)w.

As emphasized by Dubois and Prade in [9], relations (cid:18)x with x ∈ {pl, q, s} generalize set inclusion: if mA and
mB are two categorical BBAs such that mA(A) = 1 and mB (B) = 1, then mA (cid:18)x mB , with x ∈ {pl, q, s}, if and only
if A ⊆ B. The same is true for relation (cid:18)d . For relation (cid:18)w, this property does not hold, since categorical BBAs,
being dogmatic, cannot be compared according to (cid:18)w. However, we can still have a similar property if we consider a
categorical BBA as the limit of a sequence of nondogmatic BBAs. More precisely, let ((cid:6)n), n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞, be a real
sequence such that (cid:6)n ∈ [0, 1] for all n, and limn→∞ (cid:6)n = 0. For any A ⊆ Ω, let mn
A the BBA with following weight
function:

wn

(cid:6)n
1

A(C) =

if C ⊇ A,
otherwise,
for all C ⊂ Ω. It is clear that mn
for all C (cid:6)= A. This means that the categorical BBA mA may seen as the limit of the sequence (mn
being uniquely deﬁned, given ((cid:6)n). Using this representation, we can state the following proposition.

A(A) (cid:3) 1 − (cid:6)n. Consequently, we have limn→∞ mn

A(A) = 1 and limn→∞ mn

A(C) = 0,

Proposition 3. Let A and B be two subsets of Ω, mA and mB the categorical BBAs focused on A and B, and (mn

and (mn

A ⊆ B ⇔ mn

Proof. Assume that A ⊆ B. Let C be an arbitrary subset of Ω:

• if C ⊇ B, then C ⊇ A, and we have wn
• if C (cid:6)⊇ B, then wn

B (C) = 1 (cid:3) wn

A(C).

A(C) = wn

B (C) = (cid:6)n;

Conversely, assume that wn
and A ⊆ B. (cid:2)

A(C) (cid:2) wn

B (C) for all C ⊂ Ω. Then wn

A(B) (cid:2) wn

B (B) = (cid:6)n. Consequently, wn

A(B) = (cid:6)n,

Equipped with these deﬁnitions of the relative information content of belief functions, it is possible to give an
operational meaning of the LCP. Let M be a set of BBA compatible with a set of constraints. The LCP dictates to
choose a greatest element in M, if one such element exists, according to one of the partial ordering (cid:18)x , for some
x ∈ {pl, q, s, d, w}. These partial orderings seem equally well justiﬁed and reasonable and, in the absence of any
decisive argument to discard any of them, considerations of simplicity, existence of a solution and tractability of
calculations can be invoked to choose a particular ordering for a given problem. For instance, q-ordering is adopted in
[12] to derive the expression of the q-least committed BBA with given pignistic probability function. In the following
section, the same principle is used to derive a rule of combination, using partial ordering (cid:18)w.

3. The cautious conjunctive rule

3.1. Derivation from the LCP

Just as relations (cid:18)x may be seen as generalizing set inclusion, it is possible to conceive conjunctive combination
rules generalizing set intersection, by reasoning as follows. Assume that we have two sources of information, one of
which indicates that the true value of the variable of interest ω lies in A ⊆ Ω, while the other one indicates that it lies
in B ⊆ Ω, with A (cid:6)= B. If we consider both sources as reliable, then we can deduce that ω lies in some set C such that
C ⊆ A, and C ⊆ B. The largest of these subsets is the intersection A ∩ B of A and B.

Let us now assume that the two sources provide BBAs m1 and m2, and the sources are both considered to be
reliable. The agent’s state of belief, after receiving these two pieces of information, should then be represented by
a BBA m12 more informative than m1, and more informative than m2. Let us denote by Sx(m) the set of BBAs
m(cid:21) such that m(cid:21) (cid:18)x m, for some x ∈ {pl, q, s, d, w}. We thus have m12 ∈ Sx(m1) and m12 ∈ Sx(m2) or, equivalently,
m12 ∈ Sx(m1) ∩ Sx(m2). According to the LCP, one should select the x-least committed element in Sx(m1) ∩ Sx(m2).
This deﬁnes a conjunctive combination rule, provided that an x-least committed element (i.e., a greatest element with
respect with partial order (cid:18)x ) exists and is unique.

In [12], this approach was used to justify the minimum rule for combining possibility distributions, from the point
of view of the TBM. Let m1 and m2 be two consonant BBAs, and let q1 and q2 be their respective commonality
functions. Then, the consonant BBA m12 with commonality function q12(A) = q1(A) ∧ q2(A) for all A ⊆ Ω is
claimed in [12] to be the s-least committed element in the set Ss(m1) ∩ Ss(m2). This approach, however, cannot be
blindly transposed to nonconsonant BBAs, since the minimum of two commonality functions is not, in general, a
commonality function.

However, applying this approach with the (cid:18)w ordering does yield an interesting solution, as shown by the following

lemma and proposition.

Lemma 1. Let m by a nondogmatic BBA with conjunctive weight function w, and let w(cid:21) be a mapping from 2Ω \ Ω
to (0, +∞) such that w(cid:21)(A) (cid:2) w(A) for all A ⊂ Ω. Then w(cid:21) is the conjunctive weight function of some BBA m(cid:21).

Proof. We have

(cid:21)

w

(A) = w(A) · w(cid:21)(A)

w(A)

,

∀A ⊂ Ω.

Since w(cid:21)(A)/w(A) (cid:2) 1 for all A ⊂ Ω, w(cid:21)/w is the weight function of a u-separable BBA. Consequently, w(cid:21) is the
weight function of a BBA m(cid:21) obtained by combining m with a u-separable BBA using the TBM conjunctive rule. (cid:2)

246

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

Proposition 4. Let m1 and m2 be two nondogmatic BBAs. The w-least committed element in Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) exists
and is unique. It is deﬁned by the following weight function:

w1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = w1(A) ∧ w2(A),

∀A ⊂ Ω.

(47)

Proof. For i = 1 and i = 2, we have m ∈ Sw(mi) iff w(A) (cid:2) wi(A) for all A ⊂ Ω. Hence, m ∈ Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) iff
w(A) (cid:2) w1(A) ∧ w2(A) for all A ⊂ Ω. Let us consider function w1 ∧(cid:14)2 deﬁned by w1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = w1(A) ∧ w2(A), for
all A ⊂ Ω. This is the conjunctive weight function of a valid BBA, as a consequence of Lemma 1. Consequently, it
corresponds to the unique w-least committed element in Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2). (cid:2)

Eq. (47) deﬁnes a new rule which can be formally deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 1 (Cautious conjunctive rule). Let m1 and m2 be two nondogmatic BBAs. Their combination using the
cautious conjunctive rule (or cautious rule for short) is noted m1 ∧(cid:14)2 = m1 ∧(cid:14) m2. It is deﬁned as the BBA with the
following weight function:

w1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = w1(A) ∧ w2(A),

∀A ⊂ Ω.

We thus have

m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw1(A)∧w2(A).

(48)

Note that this rule happens to generalize a method proposed by Kennes [19] for combining u-separable BBAs
induced by nondistinct items of evidence, based on an application of category theory to evidential reasoning. Using
the canonical decomposition of nondogmatic belief functions and the concept of w-ordering, the new rule described
in this paper proves to be well justiﬁed for combining the wider class of nondogmatic belief functions.

As another remark, it must also be emphasized that the cautious rule provides a BBA m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 which is the w-least
committed in the set Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) of BBAs that are w-more committed than both m1 and m2. When either m1
or m2 is not u-separable, then m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 does not belong to that set (because, e.g., w1(A)w2(A) > w1(A) whenever
w2(A) > 1). Consequently, we do not have m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 (cid:18)w m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 in general, except when both m1 and m2 are
separable.

In practice, the cautious combination of two nondogmatic BBAs m1 and m2 can thus be computed as follows:

• Compute the commonality functions q1 and q2 using (5);
• Compute the weight functions w1 and w2 using (26);
• Compute m1 ∧(cid:14)2 = m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 as the ∩(cid:14) combination of GSBBAs Aw1(A)∧w2(A), for all A ⊂ Ω such that w1 ∧

w2(A) (cid:6)= 1.

Example 2. Table 2 shows the weight functions of two BBAs m1 and m2 on Ω = {a, b, c}, a well as the combined
weight function w1 ∧(cid:14)2 and BBA m1 ∧(cid:14) m2. In this case, m1 ∧(cid:14)2 is obtained as the TBM conjunctive combination of
three SBBAs: {b}0.7, {a, b}2/5 and {b, c}2/7. By combining the ﬁrst two we get a mass 0.3 on {b}, 3/5 × 0.7 = 0.42
on {a, b} and 2/5 × 0.7 = 0.28 on Ω. Combination with {b, c}2/7 then yields

column of Table 2 for comparison.

3.2. Properties

Proposition 5. The cautious conjunctive rule has the following properties:

Commutativity: for all m1 and m2, m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 = m2 ∧(cid:14) m1;
Associativity: for all m1, m2 and m3, m1 ∧(cid:14) (m2 ∧(cid:14) m3) = (m1 ∧(cid:14) m2) ∧(cid:14) m3;
Idempotence: for all m, m ∧(cid:14) m = m;
Distributivity of ∩(cid:14) with respect to ∧(cid:14): for all m1, m2 and m3,

m1 ∩(cid:14) (m2 ∧(cid:14) m3) = (m1 ∩(cid:14) m2) ∧(cid:14) (m1 ∩(cid:14) m3).

Proof. Commutativity, associativity and idempotence result directly from corresponding properties of the minimum
operator. Distributivity of ∩(cid:14) with respect to ∧(cid:14) is a consequence of distribution of the product with respect to the
minimum:

w1(w2 ∧ w3) = (w1w2) ∧ (w1w3),

∀w1, w2, w3.

(cid:2)

The last property (distributivity) is actually quite important, as it explains why the cautious rule can be considered
to be more relevant than the TBM conjunctive rule ∩(cid:14) when combining nondistinct items of evidence: if two sources
provide BBAs m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 and m1 ∩(cid:14) m3 having some evidence m1 in common, the shared evidence is not counted
twice.

The following proposition is linked to the notion of LBS introduced in Section 2.2.4. It will be useful to explain

some additional properties of the cautious rule.

Proposition 6. Let m1 and m2 be two nondogmatic BBAs with conjunctive weight functions w1 and w2. Let (mc
and (mc

We thus see that, using the cautious rule, the conﬁdence parts are combined conjunctively, whereas the difﬁdence
parts are combined disjunctively by taking the maximum of the two weight functions wd
2 . Note that such a
disjunctive combination is well deﬁned only for u-separable BBAs (see Section 4 for further discussion on this issue
and the deﬁnition of a disjunctive counterpart of the cautious rule). Combining the difﬁdence components disjunctively
does seem to make sense, as shown by the following informal argument. According to Smets [32], md (A) should be
interpreted as the strength of evidence that one should not believe A. If I receive two pieces of evidence, one of
which tells me not to believe A while the other tells me not to believe B, then I am inclined not to believe A ∪ B,
hence the disjunctive nature of the combination. Consequently, there seems to be some form of duality between the
conﬁdence and difﬁdence components of a LBS, which translates into different mechanisms for combining each of
the two components.

1 and wd

As is well known, the vacuous BBA is the neutral element for the TBM conjunctive rule, whereas it is an absorbing
element for the TBM disjunctive rule. As a consequence of the dual conjunctive/disjunctive nature of the cautious
rule, cautious combination of a BBA m with the vacuous BBA has the effect of absorbing the difﬁdence component,
while leaving the conﬁdence component unchanged. This is formalized in the following proposition.

Proposition 7. For any nondogmatic BBA m with corresponding LBS (mc, md ):

m ∧(cid:14) mΩ = mc.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Proposition 6. Let wc and wd denote, respectively, the weight functions of mc
and md . The weights associated to the conﬁdence component of m ∧(cid:14) mΩ are wc(A) ∧ 1 = wc(A) for all A ⊂ Ω,
whereas those associated to the difﬁdence component are wd (A) ∨ 1 = 1 for all A ⊂ Ω. (cid:2)

The following proposition follows directly from the previous one.

Proposition 8. For any nondogmatic BBA m, mΩ ∧(cid:14) m = m iff m is u-separable.

Proof. m is u-separable iff it is equal to its conﬁdence component, i.e. m = mc, hence the result. (cid:2)

Proposition 8 implies that, when combining a BBA m with the vacuous BBA using the cautious rule, one does
not in general recover m but only a u-separable approximation in the form of its conﬁdence component. This is a
consequence of Proposition 6, which shows that, for non-u-separable BBAs, the cautious rule is not purely conjunctive
as it combines the difﬁdence components in a disjunctive manner. Furthermore, it is easy to see that the cautious
conjunctive rule has no neutral element, since the only BBA m0 such that m ∧(cid:14) m0 = m for any u-separable BBA m
is the vacuous BBA, and this property is not satisﬁed for non-u-separable BBAs.

Note that, in practice, the cautious rule will often behave in a purely conjunctive fashion because most belief
functions encountered in applications are u-separable. This is the case, in particular, for belief functions elicited from
experts, which are often obtained by discounting logical propositions. This is also the case for consonant BBAs, as
shown in Section 2.2.2, and for belief functions inferred using the General Bayesian Theorem [2,31] (see Section 6) or
the evidential case-based reasoning approach [4,5], two widely used mechanisms for reasoning with belief functions
in diagnosis and classiﬁcation applications [6].

To conclude this description of the main properties of the cautious rule, it is important to mention some implications

of selecting the (cid:18)w ordering in its deﬁnition. As a consequence of (46), we have, for any bbas m1 and m2;

Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) ⊆ Sd (m1) ∩ Sd (m2) ⊆ Ss(m1) ∩ Ss(m2) ⊆ Spl(m1) ∩ Spl(m2)

and

Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) ⊆ Sd (m1) ∩ Sd (m2) ⊆ Ss(m1) ∩ Ss(m2) ⊆ Sq (m1) ∩ Sq (m2),

with the subset relations being usually strict. Choosing the combined bba in Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2), as done by the cautious
rule, then comes down to choosing the smallest set of possible combined bbas in the above relations. In that set, the
cautious rule selects the w-least committed element, which exists and is unique, as stated by Proposition 4. In that
sense, it may be termed “cautious” as it is derived from the LCP. However, it must be kept in mind that the choice

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

249

of Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2) imposes severe restrictions on the combination. As a consequence, bbas x-less committed than
m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 (with x ∈ {w, d, s, pl, q}) may exist outside Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2). In particular, when m1 or m2 is not u-
separable, m1 ∩(cid:14) m2 does not belong to Sw(m1) ∩ Sw(m2), and it is possible to have m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 (cid:18)w m1 ∩(cid:14) m2, as shown
by the following example.1

(cid:7)

m1(A) =

Example 3. Let us consider the following bbas on Ω = {a, b, c, d, e}:
0.4 if A = {a, b} or A = {b, c},
0.2 if A = Ω,
otherwise,
0
0.4 if A = {b, d} or A = {b, e},

if A = {a, b} or A = {b, c},
if A = {b},
otherwise,
if A = {b, d} or A = {b, e},
if A = {b},
otherwise.

It can easily be checked that w1(A) ∧ w2(A) (cid:2) w1(A)w2(A) for all A ⊂ Ω and, consequently, m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 (cid:18)w m1 ∩(cid:14) m2.

As illustrated by the previous example, the cautious rule is not more “cautious” than the TBM conjunctive rule
when applied to non-u-separable bbas, even in the sense of the (cid:18)w ordering. As will be shown in Section 5, these
two rules actually belong to two different families of rules with distinct algebraic properties, and as such they cannot
easily be compared.

The strong constraint imposed to the cautious rule seems to be the price to pay for its ease of calculation and good
properties (associativity, idempotence, distributivity of ∩(cid:14) with respect to ∧(cid:14)) as outlined above. It would, of course, be
possible to consider a larger set Sx(m1) ∩ Sx(m2), with x ∈ {d, s, pl, q} as the search space for the combination of two
bbas m1 and m2. However, the existence and unicity of a x-least committed element would then no longer be veriﬁed
in general, making it impossible to apply the LCP. One could also consider selecting a combined bba maximizing
an uncertainty measure (see, e.g., [24]). Finding both a search space and an uncertainty measure ensuring interesting
properties of the combination seems to be a very difﬁcult problem which is left for further research.

3.3. The normalized cautious rule

A normalized version of the cautious rule introduced in the previous section may be deﬁned by replacing the

conjunctive rule ∩(cid:14) by Dempster’s rule ⊕ in (48). Denoting this rule by ∧(cid:14)∗, we have:
Aw1(A)∧w2(A).

m1 ∧(cid:14)∗2 = m1 ∧(cid:14)∗

m2 =

(cid:8)

(49)

We thus have

∅(cid:6)=A⊂Ω

m1 ∧(cid:14)∗2(A) = k · m1 ∧(cid:14)2(A),

∀A ⊆ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅,

with k = (1 − m1 ∧(cid:14)2(∅))−1, and m1 ∧(cid:14)∗2(∅) = 0. Note that we can never have m1 ∧(cid:14)2(∅) = 1, because the cautious
combination of two nondogmatic BBAs can never be dogmatic. As shown in Section 2.2, the weight functions of
m1 ∧(cid:14)∗ m2 and m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 differ only by the weight assigned to the empty set: with obvious notations, we have

w1 ∧(cid:14)∗2(A) = w1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = w1(A) ∧ w2(A),

∀A ∈ 2Ω \ {∅, Ω},

1 This example was suggested to the author by Frédéric Pichon.

and w1 ∧(cid:14)∗2(∅) = k · w1 ∧(cid:14)2(∅). Clearly, this rule has the same properties as its unnormalized counterpart: it is commu-
tative, associative and idempotent. When combining several BBAs m1, . . . , mn using the normalized cautious rule, we
may either compute their unnormalized cautious combination and normalize the end result, or normalize intermediate
results in the computation. The same property is known to hold for Dempster’s rule [28].

The normalized cautious rule ∧(cid:14)∗ can be justiﬁed using the LCP with a suitable ordering relation. Let (cid:18)∗

w denote
w m2 iff w1(A) (cid:2) w2(A), for all A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅.

the following partial order between nondogmatic BBAS: m1 (cid:18)∗
Obviously, we have

m1 (cid:18)w m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:18)∗

w m2,

for all m1 and m2, and the implication is strict. When the condition m1 (cid:18)∗
w m2 holds, we will say that m1 is w∗-more
committed than m2. Using the same line of reasoning as in Section 3.1, it is easy to show that m1 ∧(cid:14)∗ m2 is the w∗-least
committed BBA among all normal BBAs which are w∗-more committed than m1 and m2.

The following proposition is a counterpart to Proposition 8:

Proposition 9. For any nondogmatic normal BBA m, mΩ ∧(cid:14)∗ m = m iff m is n-separable.

Proof. Let m be a nondogmatic normal BBA and w is weight function. Then w(A) ∧ 1 = w(A) for A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅
implies that w(A) (cid:2) 1 for A ⊂ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅, i.e., m is n-separable. The converse is obvious. (cid:2)

Example 4. Table 3 shows intermediate steps for the computation of the normalized cautious combination of two
BBAs m1 and m2. Their weight functions are ﬁrst computed and combined using the minimum operator. The corre-
sponding BBA is then computed, and normalized. It can be checked that the weight function w1 ∧(cid:14)∗2 is equal to w1 ∧(cid:14)2,
except for w1 ∧(cid:14)∗2(∅) = 1/(1 − m1 ∧(cid:14)2(∅)) = 2.57.

Note that we have, in Example 4, m1 ∧(cid:14)2(∅) = 0.61, whereas it can be checked that m1 ∩(cid:14)2(∅) = 0.27. This illustrates

the fact that the cautious rule is not related to conﬂict minimization, contrary to, e.g., the rule proposed in [1].

4. The bold disjunctive rule

Just as the cautious rule extends set intersection, as shown in Section 3.1, one may wonder whether the same
principle could be used to derive a disjunctive operator generalizing set union. Just as the union of two sets A and B is
the smallest set containing both A and B, we could attempt to deﬁne the disjunction of two BBAs m1 and m2 issued
from two sources as the most x-committed BBA, among the set of BBAs less x-committed than m1 and m2. This
approach seems appropriate when it is only known that at least one of the two sources is reliable, but we do not know
which one. The combined BBA should then be less informative than each of the BBAs provided by the individual
sources.

Formally, let us denote as Gx(m) the set of BBAs m(cid:21) such that m (cid:18)x m(cid:21). If the set Gx(m1) ∩ Gx(m2) possesses a
most x-committed element, then this element could, by deﬁnition, be equated to the disjunction of m1 and m2. Since
this BBA would be the most committed one, among those which are less informative than m1 and m2, such a rule
could be named a bold disjunctive rule.

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

251

If we adopt w-ordering as the deﬁnition of inclusion, then Gw(m1) is the set of BBAs m such that w(A) (cid:3) w1(A)
for all A ⊂ Ω. Similarly, Gw(m2) contains the BBAs m such that w(A) (cid:3) w2(A) for all A ⊂ Ω. The intersection
Gw(m1) ∩ Gw(m2) thus contains the set of BBAs for which w(A) (cid:3) w1(A) ∨ w2(A) for all A ⊂ Ω, where ∨ denotes
the maximum operator. The most w-committed element in that set, if it exists, has the weight function w1 ∨ w2. This
approach is valid in the case where m1 and m2 are both separable BBA: in that case, we still have w1(A) ∨ w2(A) (cid:2) 1
for all A ⊂ Ω, and w1 ∨ w2 deﬁnes a separable belief function [19]. However, this rule cannot be used to combine
arbitrary nondogmatic BBAs, because w1 ∨ w2 does not always correspond to a belief function, as shown by the
following counterexample.

Example 5. Consider the two BBAs m1 and m2 of Example 2, and let w = w1 ∨ w2 be the weight function obtained
by taking the maximum of the weight functions of m1 and m2. We have w({b}) = 7/4 ∨ 0.7 = 7/4, w({b, c}) =
2/7∨3/7 = 3/7, and w(A) = 1 for all other A ⊂ Ω. The corresponding mass function is thus the TBM combination of
ISBBA {b}7/4 and SBBA {b, c}3/7. We get m({b}) = −3/4, m({b, c}) = 7/4 × 4/7 = 1, and m(Ω) = 7/4 × 3/7 = 3/4,
which does not correspond to a belief function.

In the rest of this section, we will show that the above approach does allow to deﬁne a disjunctive counterpart of the
cautious rule, provided it is based on a proper informational ordering of belief functions. To deﬁne such an ordering,
we will need to introduce a canonical disjunctive representation of belief functions, dual to the “conjunctive” one
introduced in [32] and recalled in Section 2.2. This representation is presented in the following section.

4.1. Canonical disjunctive decomposition of a subnormal BBA

Let m be a subnormal BBA. Its complement m is nondogmatic and can be decomposed as

m = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw(A).

Consequently, m can be written

m = ∩(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw(A) = ∪(cid:14)
A⊂Ω

Aw(A).

We recall that Aw(A) denotes the GSBBA assigning a mass w(A) > 0 to Ω and a mass 1−w(A) to A. Consequently, its
complement Aw(A) is a generalized BBA with two focal sets: A with a mass 1 − w(A), and ∅ with a mass w(A). Such
a mapping can be called a negative GSBBA, as it is the negation of a GSBBA, and noted Av(A), with v(A) = w(A).
We can thus write
m = ∪(cid:14)
A⊂Ω
= ∪(cid:14)
A(cid:6)=∅

Av(A)

Av(A).

(51)

(50)

We have proved the following proposition:

Proposition 10 (Canonical disjunctive decomposition). Any subnormal BBA m can be uniquely decomposed as the
∪(cid:14)-combination of negative generalized BBAs Av(A) assigning a mass v(A) > 0 to ∅, and a mass 1 − v(A) to A, for
all A ⊆ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅:
m = ∪(cid:14)
A(cid:6)=∅

Av(A).

(52)

Function v : 2Ω \ {∅} → (0, +∞) will be referred to as the disjunctive weight function. It is related to the conjunctive
weight function w associated to the negation m of m by the equation

v(A) = w(A),

∀A (cid:6)= ∅.

(53)

A comparison between Eqs. (8) and (53) shows that the relation between v and w parallels that between b and q.
As a consequence, v can be obtained from b using a formula similar to (28), as expressed in the following proposition.

Proposition 11. Let v and b the disjunctive weight and implicability functions associated to a subnormal BBA m.
They are related by the following equation:
(cid:4)

ln v(A) = −

(−1)

|A|−|B|

ln b(B).

(54)

B⊆A

Proof. Using (53) and (28), we have

ln v(A) = ln w(A)
= −

(cid:4)

(−1)

|B|−|A|

ln q(B).

B⊇A

Now, (8) implies that q(B) = b(B). Observing that B ⊇ A ⇔ B ⊆ A, and |B| − |A| = |A| − |B|, we get the desired
result. (cid:2)

Note that relation (54) between ln v and − ln b has the same form as relation (7) between m and b. Consequently,

any procedure for transforming b to m can be used to compute ln v from − ln b.

Example 6. Table 4 illustrates the computation of disjunctive weights using (53).

Just as the TBM conjunctive rule can be easily computed using conjunctive weights using (35), the TBM disjunctive

rule has a simple expression in terms of the disjunctive weights, as shown by the following proposition.

Proposition 12. Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs with disjunctive weight functions v1 and v2. The disjunctive
weight function v1 ∪(cid:14)2 associated to m1 ∪(cid:14) m2 is given by v1 ∪(cid:14)2 = v1v2.

Proof. It is easy to check that we have Av ∪(cid:14) Av(cid:21) = Avv(cid:21) . Consequently, we have:

m1 ∪(cid:14) m2 =

Av1(A)

∪(cid:14)

(cid:19)

∪(cid:14)
A(cid:6)=∅

= ∪(cid:14)

(cid:19)

(cid:20)

Av2(A)

∪(cid:14)
A(cid:6)=∅
(cid:2)

Av1(A)v2(A).

(55)

(56)

It follows directly that the inverse (cid:6)∪(cid:14) of the TBM disjunctive rule also has a simple expression in the v-space, as

v1 (cid:6)∪(cid:14)2 = v1/v2.

Finally, the concept of latent belief structure recalled in Section 2.2.4 also has a disjunctive counterpart. For each

disjunctive weight v(A) let us deﬁne the following two quantities:

and

vc(A) = 1 ∧ v(A),

vd (A) = 1 ∧ 1
v(A)

.

4.2. Informational ordering based on disjunctive weights

The concept of disjunctive weight function deﬁned above makes it possible to deﬁne a new partial ordering relation

between belief functions, which is the counterpart of (cid:18)w introduced in Section 2.3.

Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs with disjunctive weight functions v1 and v2. Assume that v1(A) (cid:3) v2(A),
for all A (cid:6)= ∅. Let v = v2/v1, and m the corresponding BBA (it corresponds to a belief function, since v(A) (cid:2) 1 for
all A (cid:6)= ∅). We thus have m2 = m1 ∪(cid:14) m, which implies that m1 is a specialization of m2. In that sense, m1 is more
informative than m2. Consequently, the following new informational ordering can be introduced:

m1 (cid:18)v m2 ⇔ v1(A) (cid:3) v2(A),

∀A (cid:6)= ∅.

If m1 (cid:18)v m2, we will say that m1 is v-more committed than m2.

Just as (cid:18)v is a counterpart of (cid:18)w as a result of the duality between the conjunctive and disjunctive decompositions,
we may observe that it is also possible to deﬁne a dual to the d-ordering (Dempsterian specialization) recalled in
Section 2.3. Assume that m2 = m1 ∪(cid:14) m for some arbitrary bba m. Then m1 is a particular kind of specialization of
m2, which we can write as: m1 (cid:18)dd m2. This new ordering is obviously stronger than (cid:18)s , but weaker than (cid:18)v. The
two new ordering relations (cid:18)v and (cid:18)dd allow us to complete the picture drawn in Section 2.3 as follows:
(cid:3)

(cid:21)

m1 (cid:18)w m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:18)d m2
m1 (cid:18)v m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:18)dd m2

⇒ m1 (cid:18)s m2 ⇒

m1 (cid:18)pl m2,
m1 (cid:18)q m2,

where again all implications are strict.

4.3. Derivation of the bold disjunctive rule

Using the general approach outlined at the beginning of this section, we can deﬁne a disjunctive rule based on the

(cid:18)v ordering, as shown by the following proposition.

Proposition 13. Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs. The v-most committed element in Gv(m1) ∩ Gv(m2) exists
and is unique. It is deﬁned by the following disjunctive weight function:

v1 ∨(cid:14)2(A) = v1(A) ∧ v2(A),

∀A ∈ 2Ω \ ∅.

(63)

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 4. For any m ∈ Gv(m1) ∩ Gv(m2), we have v(A) (cid:2) v1(A) and
v(A) (cid:2) v2(A), hence v(A) (cid:2) v1(A) ∧ v2(A) for all nonempty subset A of Ω. The v-most committed element in
Gv(m1) ∩ Gv(m2) is obtained by taking the minimum of v1(A) and v2(A) for all A. One can verify that it corresponds
to a belief function, as a consequence of a counterpart of Lemma 1 for disjunctive weights. (cid:2)

Eq. (63) introduces a new rule which can be formally deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 2 (Bold disjunctive rule). Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs. Their combination using the bold
disjunctive rule is noted m1 ∨(cid:14)2 = m1 ∨(cid:14) m2. It is deﬁned as the BBA with the following disjunctive weight function:

v1 ∨(cid:14)2(A) = v1(A) ∧ v2(A), A ∈ 2Ω \ ∅.

We thus have

m1 ∨(cid:14) m2 = ∪(cid:14)
A(cid:6)=∅

Av1(A)∧v2(A).

(64)

Example 7. Table 5 shows two subnormal BBAs, together with their v-representation and their bold disjunction. The
resulting BBA m1 ∨(cid:14)2 may be computed from v1 ∨(cid:14)2 by combining the three BBAs {b}1/6, {a, b}1/4 and {b, c}1/7 using
the disjunctive rule ∪(cid:14). The result of the combination using the TBM disjunctive rule is shown in the last column for
comparison.

The fact that the bold disjunctive rule is only applicable to subnormal BBAs may appear as a severe restriction, as
most belief functions encountered in practice are normal (and subnormality often arises when combining conﬂicting
items of evidence using the TBM conjunctive rule). However, practically, it is always possible to “denormalize” a
BBA by transferring a very small proportion of the unit mass of belief to the empty set. In the TBM, the mass m(∅)
may be interpreted as being committed to the hypothesis than none of the elementary hypotheses in the frame of
discernment is true. Assigning even an inﬁnitesimal mass to this hypothesis may be justiﬁed in most cases, as a way
to acknowledge the fact that the adopted model might not be complete, unlikely as it may be.

4.4. Properties of the bold disjunctive rule

The bold disjunctive rule has properties which parallel those of the cautious conjunctive rule, due to the dual nature

of these two rules. These properties are listed below.

Proposition 14. The bold disjunctive rule has the following properties:

Commutativity: for all m1 and m2, m1 ∨(cid:14) m2 = m2 ∨(cid:14) m1;
Associativity: for all m1, m2 and m3, m1 ∨(cid:14) (m2 ∨(cid:14) m3) = (m1 ∨(cid:14) m2) ∨(cid:14) m3;
Idempotence: for all m, m ∨(cid:14) m = m;
Distributivity of ∪(cid:14) with respect to ∨(cid:14): for all m1, m2 and m3,

m1 ∪(cid:14) (m2 ∨(cid:14) m3) = (m1 ∪(cid:14) m2) ∨(cid:14) (m1 ∪(cid:14) m3).

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 18. (cid:2)

The following proposition is the counterpart of Proposition 6, and can be derived in the same manner. It shows that

the bold disjunctive rule treats differently the two components of disjunctive LBSs.

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

Proposition 15. Let m1 and m2 be two subnorm BBAs with disjunctive weight functions v1 and v2. Let (mc
and (mc
denote the corresponding disjunctive weights. Then the disjunctive LBS (mc
is deﬁned by

dis,2) denote the disjunctive LBSs associated to m1 and m2, respectively, and let (vc

Finally, the following proposition shows that the ∨(cid:14) and ∧(cid:14) operations are dual to each other with respect to

complementation, i.e., they are linked by De Morgan laws analogous to (16) and (17).

Proposition 16 (De Morgan’s laws). Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs. We have:

m1 ∨(cid:14) m2 = m1 ∧(cid:14) m2,

for all subnormal BBAs m1 and m2, and

m1 ∧(cid:14) m2 = m1 ∨(cid:14) m2

for all nondogmatic BBAs m1 and m2.

Proof. Let m1 and m2 be two subnormal BBAs. We have

m1 ∨(cid:14) m2 =

5. General combination rules based on triangular norms and conorms

As we have seen, the cautious and TBM conjunctive rules are based on pointwise combination of conjunctive
weights (using, respectively, the minimum and the product), whereas the bold and TBM disjunctive rule are based
on similar combination of disjunctive weights. One may wonder whether such operations on weights could be gen-
eralized to deﬁne other combination rules with interesting properties. To simplify the discussion, only operations on
conjunctive weights will be considered here; extension to disjunctive weights is obvious.

Let m1 and m2 be two nondogmatic BBAs with conjunctive weight functions w1 and w2. We have seen that each
weight w(A) may be decomposed into two components in [0, 1]: a conﬁdence component wc(A) = 1 ∧ w(A) and a
difﬁdence component wd (A) = 1 ∧ (w(A))−1, with w(A) = wc(A)/wd (A).

Both the TBM conjunctive rule and the cautious rule can be described in terms of operations on conjunctive and

disjunctive weights:

• The TBM conjunctive rule combines the conﬁdence and difﬁdence components of the weights using the product:

1 ∩(cid:14)2(A) = wc
wc
1 ∩(cid:14)2(A) = wd
wd

1(A) · wc
1 (A) · wd

2(A),
2 (A);

(67)

(68)

• The cautious rule combines the conﬁdence components using the minimum, and the difﬁdence components using

the maximum:

256

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = wc
wc
1 ∧(cid:14)2(A) = wd
wd

1(A) ∧ wc
1 (A) ∨ wd

2(A),
2 (A).

(69)

(70)

Can these operations be generalized? To answer this question, we may observe that, in the interval [0, 1], the
product and the minimum are triangular norms (t-norms for short), whereas the maximum is a triangular conorm
(or t-conorm) [23]. We recall that a t-norm is a commutative and associative binary operator (cid:22) on the unit interval
satisfying the monotonicity property
y (cid:2) z ⇒ x(cid:22)y (cid:2) x(cid:22)z,

∀x, y, z ∈ [0, 1],

and the boundary condition x(cid:22)1 = x, ∀x ∈ [0, 1]. A t-conorm ⊥ has the same three basic properties (commutativity,
associativity, monotonicity) and differs only by the boundary condition x⊥0 = x. Because of their different boundary
conditions, t-norms and t-conorms are usually interpreted, respectively, as generalized conjunction and disjunction
operators in fuzzy logic.

A ﬁrst consequence of this observation is that the TBM conjunctive rule and the cautious rule combine the dif-
ﬁdence weights using operations with different algebraic properties and, in that respect, they should be regarded as
belonging to different families of combination rules. However, it does seem possible to deﬁne new combination rules
with interesting properties by generalizing the cautious rule and the TBM conjunctive rule separately. This is done in
the rest of this section, with emphasis on the generalization of the cautious rule, which is the main topic of this paper.

5.1. Generalized cautious rules

The following proposition shows that new rules for combining nondogmatic belief functions can be deﬁned by re-
placing the minimum and the maximum in (69) and (70) by, respectively, a positive t-norm and a t-conorm. (A t-norm
(cid:22) is said to be positive iff x > 0 and y > 0 implies x(cid:22)y > 0.)

where (cid:22) is a positive t-norm, and ⊥ a t-cornorm. Then:

• Function w1∗2 is the conjunctive weight function of a nondogmatic BBA m1∗2;
• We have m1∗2 (cid:18)w m1 ∧(cid:14) m2.

Proof. It is known [23] that the minimum is the largest t-norm, while the maximum is the weakest t-conorm. Con-
2 (A), hence w1∗2(A) (cid:2)
sequently, we have wc
2(A) and wd
w1(A) ∧ w2(A) for all A. Using Lemma 1, this proves that w1∗2 corresponds to a belief function. It is obviously
w-more committed than m1 ∧(cid:14) m2. Additionally, positivity of (cid:22) ensures w1∗2(A) > 0 and, consequently, that m1∗2 is
nondogmatic. (cid:2)

Note that each combined weight w1∗2(A) can be expressed directly as a function of w1(A) and w2(A) as w1∗2(A) =

w1(A) ∗(cid:22),⊥ w2(A), where ∗(cid:22),⊥ is the following operator in (0, +∞):

257

where ∗(cid:22),⊥ is deﬁned by (72). Note that the cautious rule corresponds to (cid:4)∧,∨.

The (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ operator has some interesting properties. We start with the following lemma.

Lemma 2. For any positive t-norm (cid:22) and any t-conorm ⊥, the operator ∗(cid:22),⊥ deﬁned by (72) is commutative, asso-
ciative, and satisﬁes the monotonicity property

y (cid:2) z ⇒ x ∗ y (cid:2) x ∗ z,

∀x, y, z > 0.

Proof. Commutativity results directly from the commutativity of (cid:22), ∧ and ⊥. For associativity, we may consider
different cases:

• If x (cid:2) 1, y (cid:2) 1 and z (cid:2) 1, then

(x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y) ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = (x(cid:22)y)(cid:22)z = x(cid:22)(y(cid:22)z) = x ∗(cid:22),⊥ (y ∗(cid:22),⊥ z);

• If x > 1, y > 1 and z > 1, then
(cid:17)(cid:24)(cid:17)

• If x (cid:2) 1, y (cid:2) 1 and z > 1, then

(x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y) ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = (x(cid:22)y) ∧ z = x(cid:22)y,

and

x ∗(cid:22),⊥ (y ∗(cid:22),⊥ z) = x(cid:22)(y ∧ z) = x(cid:22)y;

• If x > 1, y > 1 and z (cid:2) 1, then

(x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y) ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = (x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y) ∧ z = z,

and

x ∗(cid:22),⊥ (y ∗(cid:22),⊥ z) = x ∧ (y ∧ z) = z.

The other cases can be deduced from the above last two cases using the commutativity property. Finally, monotonicity
can be proved in a similar manner, by considering the different cases:

Case 1: y (cid:2) z (cid:2) 1. Then:

Case 2: y (cid:2) 1 < z. Then:

• if x (cid:2) 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = x(cid:22)y and x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = x(cid:22)z, and x(cid:22)y (cid:2) x(cid:22)z by the monotonicity of (cid:22);
• if x > 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = y and x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = z, and the result follows directly.

• if x (cid:2) 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = x(cid:22)y and x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = x ∧ z. Now, x(cid:22)y (cid:2) x ∧ y (cid:2) x ∧ z, since (cid:22) is dominated by ∧;
• if x > 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = y and x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = ((1/x)⊥(1/z))−1. Now, we have 1/x < 1/y and 1/z < 1/y, hence

(1/x)⊥(1/z) < 1/y and ((1/x)⊥(1/z))−1 > y.

Case 3: 1 < y (cid:2) z. Then:

• if x (cid:2) 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = x, x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = x and the result follows directly;
• if x > 1, then x ∗(cid:22),⊥ y = ((1/x)⊥(1/y))−1 and x ∗(cid:22),⊥ z = ((1/x)⊥(1/z))−1. Now, since 1/y (cid:3) 1/z, we have
(1/x)⊥(1/y) (cid:3) (1/x)⊥(1/z) by the monotonicity of ⊥, hence ((1/x)⊥(1/y))−1 (cid:2) ((1/x)⊥(1/z))−1. (cid:2)

Proposition 18. The (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ rule has the following properties:

Commutativity: for all m1 and m2, m1 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m2 = m2 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m1;

258

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

Associativity: for all m1, m2 and m3,

m1 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ (m2 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m3) = (m1 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m2) (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m3;

Monotonicity with respect to (cid:18)w: for all m1, m2 and m3,

m1 (cid:18)w m2 ⇒ m1 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m3 (cid:18)w m2 (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ m3.

Proof. These properties follow directly from corresponding properties of ∗(cid:22),⊥ expressed in Lemma 2. (cid:2)

5.2. Discussion

We thus have deﬁned a family of commutative and associative combination operators, which also have the property
of monotonicity with respect to (cid:18)w. The latter property means that, if a BBA m1 is less informative than a BBA m2
according to the (cid:18)w ordering, then this order is unchanged after combination with a third BBA. The cautious rule is
the only idempotent rule in this family, since the minimum and the maximum are, respectively, the only idempotent
t-norm and t-conorm.

We may remark that, normalized combination rules can be deﬁned in the same way, by combining the weights of
non empty subsets A of Ω, and normalizing the result. These normalized combination rules are also commutative,
associative, and monotonic with respect to (cid:18)∗
w.

The same approach can also be used to generalize the TBM conjunctive rule, by replacing the product in (67)
and (68) by two t-norms (cid:22)1 and (cid:22)2, respectively. However, some cautious should be exercised here, because the
resulting combined weight function is not guaranteed to correspond to a belief function for any choice of (cid:22)1 and (cid:22)2.
For instance, choosing (cid:22)1 = (cid:22)2 = ∧ does not yield a belief function in general. A sufﬁcient condition for obtaining
a belief function is to choose (cid:22)1 and (cid:22)2 such that (cid:22)1 (cid:2) Π (cid:2) (cid:22)2, where Π denotes the product t-norm. Deeper
investigation of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper.

One may object that these new combination rules, in spite of their interesting properties outlined in Proposition 18,
are only weakly justiﬁed. However, we may remark that the same situation prevails in Possibility theory [10], where
there are as many conjunctive and disjunctive operators as t-norms and t-conorms. Although this multiplicity of
operators may be seen as a weakness of the axiomatic foundations of Possibility theory, it also proves beneﬁcial
from a practical point of view as it provides considerable ﬂexibility to adjust the behavior of a system to user-deﬁned
requirements [13] or to learning examples. In contrast, Dempster–Shafer theory has sometimes been criticized for its
lack of ﬂexibility in the choice of combination operator [8], a criticism which, in light of the new results presented in
this paper, appears to be unjustiﬁed.

5.3. Combination rule optimization

As shown in the previous section, a commutative and associative operator based on conjunctive (or disjunctive)
weights can be associated to each pair of a t-norm and a t-conorm. By choosing parameterized families of t-norms
and t-conorms [23], it is thus possible to deﬁned parameterized families of belief function combination rules. This
introduces the possibility to learn a combination rule from examples, as shown in the following simple illustrative
example.

Example 8. Assume that the BBAs m1 and m2 shown in Table 6 have been provided by two sensors, and expert
knowledge regarding the true value of the variable of interest is represented by BBA me also shown in Table 6. For
this simple illustrative example, me was artiﬁcially constructed by combining m1 and m2 using the (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ operator
based on the Frank t-norm and dual t-conorm with parameter s = 0.5, and adding a small amount of random noise.
We recall that the Frank family of t-norms [23] is deﬁned by

⎧
⎨

x(cid:22)sy =

⎩

x ∧ y
xy
(cid:5)
1 + (sx −1)(sy −1)
logs

s−1

(cid:6)

if s = 0,
if s = 1,
otherwise,

for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], where s is a positive parameter. The dual t-conorm ⊥s is deﬁned by x⊥sy = 1 − (1 − x)(cid:22)s(1 − y).

We wish to ﬁnd a combination rule of the form (cid:4)(cid:22)s ,⊥s , where (cid:22)s and ⊥s are, respectively, the Frank t-norm and
t-conorm with parameter s, such that the combination of m1 and m2 yields a BBA as close as possible to me. Note that,
in real applications such as classiﬁer fusion problems, a large number of such learning instances would typically be
available. Parameter s was varied between 0 and 1, and for each s value the discrepancy between m12 = m1 (cid:4)(cid:22)s ,⊥s m2
and me was measured by Jousselme’s distance [18] deﬁned:

(cid:26)

d(m12, me) =

1
2

(m12 − me)t D(m12 − me),

where m12 and me are 2|Ω|-dimensional vectors of basic belief masses corresponding to m12 and me, and D is the
square matrix of size 2|Ω| deﬁned by
(cid:3)

D(A, B) =

1
|A∩B|
|A∪B|

if A = B = ∅,
otherwise.

Distance d is plotted as a function of s in Fig. 1. The best ﬁt between the combined BBA m12 and the target BBA

me is obtained for s ≈ 0.33, which is an estimate of the true value s = 0.5.

6. Application to classiﬁer fusion

Although the cautious rule and its relatives have nice mathematical properties, their usefulness in applications of
belief functions might be questioned. In this section, we present numerical experiments showing the efﬁciency of the
cautious rule and a t-norm based generalization to combine classiﬁers built from dependent features.

6.1. Problem statement and formalization

Let us consider a classiﬁcation problem with K classes and d continuous features X1, . . . , Xd . Assume that each
feature Xi has a known conditional probability distribution fk(xi) in each class ωk (k = 1, . . . , K). The class prior
probabilities are unknown. Additionally, nothing is known concerning the correlations between features.

260

T. Denœux / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 172 (2008) 234–264

This problem can be tackled in the TBM using the General Bayesian Theorem (GBT) [2,6,31]. Assume that the
known probability density fk(xi) of feature Xi in ωk is interpreted as the pignistic probability of some unknown
conditional belief function on R. For simplicity, fk(xi) will be assumed to be unimodal and symmetric. As shown in
[36], the q-least committed belief function on R associated with a unimodal symmetric pignistic probability density
fk with mode νk is consonant (and, consequently, equivalent to a plausibility measure). The corresponding possibility
distribution (called “contour function” by Shafer [28, p. 221]) is:

plk(xi) =

(cid:7)

The quantity plk(xi) is the plausibility that feature Xi takes value xi , given that the object belongs to class ωk.

Assume that the value xi of feature Xi has been observed for a certain object. What is our belief state concerning
the class of this object? In the TBM, the answer is provided by the GBT. The induced BBA on the set of classes
Ω = {ω1, . . . , ωK }, conditional on Xi = xi , is u-separable [6]. It is given by:

mΩ [xi] =

K
∩(cid:14)
k=1

{ωk}plk(xi ).

(74)

If the features Xi are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class, then the evidence of the d feature
values can be considered as distinct and, as such, can be combined by the TBM conjunctive rule:

mΩ [x1, . . . , xd ] =

=

d
∩(cid:14)
i=1
K
∩(cid:14)
k=1

mΩ [xi]

(cid:14)

{ωk}

d

i=1 plk(xi ).

If conditional independence is not assumed, then the cautious rule may be more appropriate. We then have:

mΩ [x1, . . . , xd ] =

=

d
∧(cid:14)
i=1
K
∩(cid:14)
k=1

mΩ [xi]

(cid:28)

{ωk}

d

i=1 plk(xi ).

(78)

Note that the possibility distributions plk(xi) are combined using the product t-norm in (76), whereas they are com-
bined using the minimum t-norm in (78). Using a generalized cautious rule (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ such as introduced in Section 5.1
amounts to combining the plk(xi) using t-norm (cid:22). If (cid:22) is chosen in the Frank family, then the cautious rule is recov-
ered for s = 0, whereas the TBM conjunctive rule is recovered for s = 1. Choosing s between 0 and 1 results in a
combination rule somewhere between these two extremes.

6.2. Experimental results

Numerical simulations were performed for a particular instance of the above problem, with K = 2 classes and
d = 10 features. The conditional distribution of feature vector (X1, . . . , Xd ) in class ωk was assumed to be multivariate
normal with mean μ1 = (0, . . . , 0) in class ω1 and μ2 = (1, . . . , 1) in class ω2, and with common variance matrix

with ρ ∈ [0, 1]. Conditionally on each class, the last feature X10 was thus assumed to be independent from all other
features, whereas the correlation coefﬁcient between any two features Xi and Xj , i, j ∈ {1, . . . , 9}, was equal to ρ.

For any observed feature vector x = (x1, . . . , x10), a decision was computed as follows:

• The plausibilities plk(xi) were computed using (73), for each i and each k;
• The BBAs mΩ [xi] on Ω given feature Xi were computed using (74);
• The combined BBA mΩ [x1, . . . , x10] was computed using the conjunctive rule using (76), the cautious rule using

(78), or the generalized cautious rule (cid:4)(cid:22),⊥ with (cid:22) equal to the Frank t-norm with s = 0.01;

• The pignistic transformation (18) was applied to mΩ [x1, . . . , x10], and the pignistic probability of class ω1 was

compared to some threshold.

The above procedure was repeated for n = 5000 test vectors in each class, for ρ = 0, ρ = 0.5 and ρ = 0.9. The false
positive rate (proportion of test vectors from class ω1 wrongly classiﬁed as ω2) and the true positive rate (proportion
of test vectors from class ω2 correctly classiﬁed as ω2) were estimated for each combination rule and each value of
ρ. The corresponding ROC curves (plot of the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate) are shown in
Fig. 2. In this representation, a higher curve corresponds to higher performance (higher true positive rate for any false
positive rate).

As expected, the TBM conjunctive rule achieves higher performance in the case of independent features. However,
it is outperformed by the cautious rule when features are no longer independent. The generalized cautious rule with the
Frank t-norm for s = 0.01 has intermediate performances in all three situations. This is an experimental veriﬁcation
of the validity of the cautious rule in the case of nondistinct evidence.

7. Conclusion

Two new commutative, associative and idempotent operators for belief functions have been introduced. The cau-
tious conjunctive rule ∧(cid:14) has been derived from the Least Commitment Principle with a suitable informational
ordering: the ∧(cid:14)-combination of two nondogmatic BBAs m1 and m2 has been deﬁned as the least committed BBA
according to the (cid:18)w ordering, among those which are more committed than m1 and m2, according to the same order-
ing. Symmetrically, the combination of two subnormal BBAs m1 and m2 using the bold disjunctive rule ∨(cid:14) has been
deﬁned as the most committed BBA according to (cid:18)v, an ordering dual to (cid:18)w, among BBAs that are less committed
than m1 and m2.

Contrary to the TBM conjunctive and disjunctive rules ∩(cid:14) and ∪(cid:14), these two operators do not require the assumption
of independence, or distinctness of the information sources from which BBAs are derived. Independently from this
distinctness assumption, conjunctive operators ∩(cid:14) and ∧(cid:14) are appropriate when all sources are believed to be reliable,
whereas disjunctive operators should be used when one only assumes that at least one of the sources is reliable. The
choice of one operator among ∩(cid:14), ∪(cid:14), ∧(cid:14) and ∨(cid:14) thus depends on assumptions regarding both the distinctness and
reliability of the sources, as summarized in the following table:

Sources

Distinct

All reliable
∩(cid:14)

At least one reliable
∪(cid:14)

Nondistinct

∧(cid:14)

∨(cid:14)

The cautious and bold rules have also been shown to belong to inﬁnite families of conjunctive and disjunctive
operators based on t-norms and t-conorms. Using parametrized families of t-norms and t-conorms, corresponding
families of conjunctive and disjunctive operators can be deﬁned. All these operators are commutative and associative,
but only ∧(cid:14) and ∨(cid:14) are idempotent. Although these operators do not appear to be as well justiﬁed as the cautious and
bold rules, they may be useful in classiﬁcation or information fusion applications where the behavior of a combination
rule can be tuned to optimize a given performance measure [5,16,42]. In any case, it appears that, contrary to a
so far widely accepted opinion [8], the richness of potential combination operators is not lower in the theory of
belief functions than it is in possibility theory, which opens new perspectives for applying belief functions theory to
information fusion problems.
