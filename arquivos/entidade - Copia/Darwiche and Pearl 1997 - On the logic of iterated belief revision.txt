Abstract 

We  show  in  this  paper  that  the  AGM  postulates  are  too  weak  to ensure  the rational  preservation 
of  conditional  beliefs  during  belief  revision,  thus  permitting  improper  responses  to  sequences  of 
observations.  We  remedy  this  weakness  by  proposing  four  additional  postulates,  which  are  sound 
relative  to  a  qualitative  version  of  probabilistic  conditioning.  Contrary  to  the  AGM  framework, 
the  proposed  postulates  characterize  belief  revision  as  a  process  which  may  depend  on  elements 
of  an  epistemic  state  that  are  not  necessarily  captured  by  a  belief  set.  We also  show  that  a  simple 
modification  to  the  AGM  framework  can  allow  belief  revision  to  be  a function  of epistemic  states. 
We  establish  a  model-based  representation  theorem  which  characterizes  the  proposed  postulates 
and  constrains, 
under 
iterated  belief  revision. 

in  turn,  the  way  in  which  entrenchment 

orderings  may  be  transformed

revision  schemes  can  be  synthesized.  To  construct  our  belief  revision  operator  l we  will 
choose  one  such  scheme,  ensuring

Let  the  total  pre-order  of  a  ranking  K  be  defined  as  follows: 

W1  6,  W2  dzfK(W~)

We  then  have

Here,  WI  cK  w2  is  defined  as  01  <,  w:!  and  w2  &  WI ;  and  w 1 =K 04  is  dejined  as
