Abstract

The increasing variety of semantics proposed in the context of Dung’s theory of argumentation makes more and more inadequate
the example-based approach commonly adopted for evaluating and comparing different semantics. To ﬁll this gap, this paper
provides two main contributions. First, a set of general criteria for semantics evaluation is introduced by proposing a formal
counterpart to several intuitive notions related to the concepts of maximality, defense, directionality, and skepticism. Then, the
proposed criteria are applied in a systematic way to a representative set of argumentation semantics available in the literature,
namely grounded, complete, preferred, stable, semi-stable, ideal, prudent, and CF2 semantics.

1. Introduction

Interest and vitality of AI-related research in argumentation theory are witnessed, among other factors, by the
increasingly rich variety of argumentation semantics being proposed in the literature. Though most of them share
the inﬂuential theory of Dung [14] as a common reference framework, comparing and assessing semantics proposals
appears far from being a straightforward task. In fact, various kinds of motivations have been used to support the intro-
duction of new semantics with respect to “classical” proposals such as stable [23], grounded [19], complete [14] and
preferred [14] semantics. These motivations range from the desire to formalize some high-level intuition, not captured
by other proposals, to the need to achieve the “correct” treatment of a particular example (or family of examples), re-
garded as particularly signiﬁcant. For instance, CF2 semantics [2,6] has originally been conceived to deal with some
problematic behaviors of preferred semantics when dealing with odd-length cycles. Semi-stable semantics [9] aims
at avoiding the problem of non-existence of extensions affecting stable semantics in some cases, while preserving its
behavior when stable extensions exist as well as the related property of minimizing undecided arguments. Prudent

semantics [12,13] emphasizes the role of indirect attacks, which are not allowed within its extensions, while ideal
semantics [15] provides a unique-status approach which is as computationally efﬁcient as grounded semantics while
being less skeptical.

Clearly, these kinds of heterogeneous intuitions hardly lend themselves to systematic comparisons. As a further dif-
ﬁculty, general comparison and evaluation criteria are actually lacking, since the problem of identifying and formally
characterizing such criteria seems to have received relatively limited attention in the literature. Given this situation, it
is not surprising that comparisons are quite often carried out using speciﬁc problematic examples, often ingeniously
devised so as to bring to light patently different behaviors exhibited by the semantics under discussion. A sample
collection of this kind of “benchmark problems” can be found for instance in [25]. While carefully selected examples
can surely provide useful insights for the analysis of alternative semantics proposals, example-based comparisons
suffer from several signiﬁcant drawbacks. First of all, they are affected by the inherent limitation of relying more on
intuition than on formally stated principles. In fact, even in relatively simple examples there may not be a general
agreement on the “desired” outcome, due to different underlying intuitions (see for instance [16]). For this reason, it
has been observed that using intuition about speciﬁc examples to derive general considerations may be inappropriate
and “it is better to use intuitions not as critical tests but as generators for further investigation” [20]. The signiﬁ-
cance of benchmark problems as testbeds for evaluation and guidelines for semantics design is also put in question by
Vreeswijk’s interpolation theorem [25], which proves that “for any compatible collection of instantiated benchmark
problems there exists an abstract argumentation system that complies with every instantiated benchmark problem”.
This suggests that “the enterprise of solving more and more of these problems does not necessarily bring us to the
ultimate non-monotonic logic” [25] (see also [8, Chapter 2] for a discussion of this point). It has also to be remarked
that some examples, explicitly conceived for one-to-one comparison of speciﬁc semantics, may turn out to be less
signiﬁcant when evaluating a large range of proposals. Moreover, these examples typically are aimed at evidencing
(and possibly overemphasizing) differences, while a balanced evaluation should also take into account similarities and
common features. Emphasis on disagreement gives rise, as a side-effect, to the quest for the “right” semantics, which,
in our opinion, is a misleading objective. In fact, different application domains may well require different styles of
reasoning, reﬂected by different semantics ﬂavors. Characterizing the reasoning requirements of different domains
(still a largely open research problem) can only be based on general criteria rather than on speciﬁc cases.

In this paper we investigate the deﬁnition of some general criteria for evaluating extension-based argumentation
semantics in the framework of Dung’s theory. The introduced criteria are then applied to several literature proposals,
thus providing a principle-based systematic assessment of state-of-the-art approaches in argumentation semantics.

The paper is organized as follows. After recalling the necessary background concepts in Section 2, we deﬁne and
discuss general criteria for evaluating sets of extensions in Section 3 and comparison criteria based on the notion
of skepticism in Section 4. The deﬁnitions of grounded, complete, preferred, stable, semi-stable, ideal, prudent, and
CF2 semantics are reviewed in Section 5: the introduced criteria are then applied to the above mentioned semantics in
Section 6. Finally, a discussion of the relationships with related works and some conclusions are provided in Section 7.

2. Basic concepts

2.1. Abstract argumentation frameworks

Our work adopts as a reference Dung’s theory of abstract argumentation frameworks.

Deﬁnition 1. An argumentation framework is a pair AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), where A is a set and →⊆ (A × A) is a binary
relation on A, called attack relation.

We assume that A represents the set of arguments produced by a reasoner at a given instant of time, therefore in
the following we will assume that A is ﬁnite, independently of the fact that the underlying mechanism of argument
generation admits the existence of inﬁnite sets of arguments. The treatment of argumentation frameworks where A is
inﬁnite, including the special case of ﬁnitary argumentation frameworks [14] where the number of attackers of each
argument is ﬁnite, is left for future work.

677

An argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) can be represented as a directed graph, called the defeat graph, where
nodes are the arguments and edges correspond to the elements of the attack relation. The nodes that attack a given
argument α are called defeaters (or parents) of α and form a set which is denoted as parAF(α).

Deﬁnition 2. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and an argument α ∈ A, parAF(α) (cid:2) {β ∈ A | β → α}.
If parAF(α) = ∅, then α is called an initial argument. The set of initial arguments of AF is denoted as IN(AF).

Since we will frequently consider properties of sets of arguments, it is useful to deﬁne suitable notations for them.

Deﬁnition 3. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), an argument α ∈ A and two (not necessarily disjoint)
sets S, P ⊆ A, we deﬁne:

S → α ≡ ∃β ∈ S: β → α
α → S ≡ ∃β ∈ S: α → β
S → P ≡ ∃α ∈ S, β ∈ P : α → β
outparAF(S) = {α ∈ A | α /∈ S ∧ α → S}
outchildAF(S) = {α ∈ A | α /∈ S ∧ S → α}

We also deﬁne the restriction of an argumentation framework to a subset S of its arguments.

Deﬁnition 4. Let AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) be an argumentation framework. The restriction of AF to S ⊆ A is the argumentation
framework AF↓S = (cid:3)S, → ∩(S × S)(cid:5).

2.2. Extension-based argumentation semantics

Given an argumentation framework encoding the conﬂicts among a set of arguments, a fundamental problem
consists in determining the conﬂict outcome, namely which arguments can be considered justiﬁed. An argumentation
semantics can be conceived, in broad terms, as a formal way to answer this question. In argumentation literature, two
main styles of semantics deﬁnition can be identiﬁed: extension-based and labeling-based.

An extension-based argumentation semantics is deﬁned by specifying the criteria for deriving, for a generic ar-
gumentation framework, a set of extensions, where each extension represents a set of arguments considered to be
acceptable together. Given a generic argumentation semantics S, the set of extensions prescribed by S for a given
argumentation framework AF is denoted as ES (AF). If a semantics S prescribes ES (AF) to be a singleton for any
argumentation framework AF, S is said to belong to the unique-status approach, otherwise to the multiple-status
approach [22].

A labeling-based argumentation semantics relies on a predeﬁned set of labels and is deﬁned by specifying the
criteria for assigning them to the arguments of a generic argumentation framework. Depending on the criteria, one
or (typically) more possible labellings are obtained. Most argumentation semantics proposed in the literature are
extension-based (e.g. grounded, complete, stable, preferred, semi-stable, ideal, prudent, and CF2 semantics) while
examples of labeling-based proposals are represented by robust semantics [17] and by argumentation stages [24]. It
has also to be remarked that in some cases a labeling deﬁnition has an equivalent counterpart in terms of extensions
(see for instance [10]). For these reasons, we focus on extension-based semantics and leave the consideration of
labeling-based approaches for future work.

The extensions prescribed by a semantics are the basis for deriving the justiﬁcation state of each argument. Though
a more articulated treatment is possible [5], in this paper we consider a basic classiﬁcation encompassing just two
possible states for an argument, namely justiﬁed or not justiﬁed. Two alternative types of justiﬁcation, namely skeptical
and credulous can be considered.

Deﬁnition 5. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a semantics S, an argument α is skeptically
justiﬁed iff ∀E ∈ ES (AF) α ∈ E, and is credulously justiﬁed iff ∃E ∈ ES (AF): α ∈ E.

A relevant question concerns the existence of extensions. While the deﬁnition of most semantics ensures that there
is at least one extension for any argumentation framework, it is well known that this is not always the case. In particular,
there are defeat graphs including odd-length cycles where stable semantics fails to provide any extension. To settle
this difﬁculty once and for all, we take as a standpoint that argumentation frameworks for which no extension exists
are simply outside the applicability domain of the considered semantics and therefore they neither play any role in
the properties of the semantics nor can the semantics be used in any way to assess the justiﬁcation of their arguments.
Formally, for a generic semantics S let DS be the set of argumentation frameworks where S admits at least one
extension, namely DS = {AF: ES (AF) (cid:15)= ∅}: in the following, whenever we will refer to the properties of a semantics
S for an argumentation framework AF we will implicitly assume that AF ∈ DS if not differently speciﬁed. Note that
the case of non-existence of extensions, namely ES (AF) = ∅, is signiﬁcantly different from the case ES (AF) = {∅},
where the semantics prescribes exactly one (actually empty) extension. Note in particular that, in the latter case,
AF ∈ DS .

Let us now introduce two fundamental principles underlying the deﬁnition of extension-based semantics in Dung’s

framework, namely the language independence principle and the conﬂict free principle.

The language independence principle intuitively consists in the fact that the extensions prescribed by a semantics
only depend on the relations of attack between arguments considered as abstract entities, namely on the topology
of the corresponding defeat graph, while extensions are totally independent of any property of arguments at the
underlying level of the language where their internal structure and features can be explicitly represented. Formally,
this principle corresponds to the fact that argumentation frameworks which are isomorphic have the “same” (modulo
the isomorphism) extensions, as stated by the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 6. Two argumentation frameworks AF1 = (cid:3)A1, →1(cid:5) and AF2 = (cid:3)A2, →2(cid:5) are isomorphic if and only if
there is a bijective mapping m : A1 → A2, such that (α, β) ∈ →1 if and only if (m(α), m(β)) ∈ →2. This is denoted
as AF1

◦=m AF2.

Deﬁnition 7. A semantics S satisﬁes the language independence principle if and only if ∀ AF1 = (cid:3)A1, →1(cid:5), ∀ AF2 =
(cid:3)A2, →2(cid:5): AF1

◦=m AF2, ES (AF2) = {M(E) | E ∈ ES (AF1)}, where M(E) = {β ∈ A2 | ∃α ∈ E, β = m(α)}.

All semantics deﬁned at the abstract level of Dung’s framework, and in particular all semantics we will deal with

in this paper, adhere to the language independence principle.

The conﬂict free principle, denoted as CF , intuitively relies on the idea that, since an extension is a set of arguments
which are “acceptable together”, no conﬂicting arguments can be included in the same extension. The CF principle
has a straightforward formal counterpart.

Deﬁnition 8. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set S ⊆ A is conﬂict-free, denoted as cf (S), iff
(cid:2)α, β ∈ S such that α → β. A semantics S satisﬁes the CF principle if and only if ∀ AF, ∀E ∈ ES (AF) E is conﬂict-
free.

As to our knowledge, all extension-based argumentation semantics proposed in the literature1 adhere to the CF
principle, which in the following will be given for granted. Therefore, where no further speciﬁcations are given, by a
set of extensions of an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) we will mean a set of conﬂict-free subsets of A.

3. Extension evaluation criteria

By an extension evaluation criterion we mean a property of a set of extensions on its own, not involving a compar-
ison with other sets of extensions. We discuss evaluation criteria related to three different aspects: the maximality of
extensions, the notion of defense, and the topology of the defeat graph.

1 Note, however, that the deﬁnition of the CF principle as given in this paper is not directly applicable to literature approaches featuring a richer
structure of argumentation frameworks and lying therefore outside the strict context of Dung’s theory (e.g. preference-based [1] or value-based [7]
argumentation frameworks).

3.1. The I-maximality criterion

Given that an extension can be intuitively conceived as a set of arguments that can be accepted together according
to some semantics-speciﬁc requirements, one may consider as an additional constraint that no extension can be a
proper subset of another one. This has a straightforward formal counterpart.

Deﬁnition 9. A set of extensions E is I-maximal iff ∀E1, E2 ∈ E, if E1 ⊆ E2 then E1 = E2. A semantics S satisﬁes
the I-maximality criterion if and only if ∀ AF ES (AF) is I-maximal.

Note that I-maximality is a property of the set of extensions E per se and does not imply that maximality is
prescribed by the semantics-speciﬁc deﬁnition of what an extension is. For instance any unique-status semantics nec-
essarily satisﬁes I-maximality according to Deﬁnition 9, independently of the fact that the unique extension prescribed
by the semantics is a maximal set in any sense. I-maximality is an important criterion in relation to the notion of skep-
tical justiﬁcation: given two extensions E1 and E2 belonging to a set of extensions E, if E1 (cid:3) E2 then any argument
α ∈ E2 \ E1 cannot be skeptically justiﬁed according to Deﬁnition 5. As a limit case, if the empty set is included in
the set of extensions then any argument cannot be skeptically justiﬁed, independently of other extensions. To avoid
this kind of undesired effect, I-maximality is a crucial criterion and is in fact enforced by most semantics, as it will be
discussed in Section 6. On the other hand, when the set of extensions is not meant to be used for evaluating skeptical
justiﬁcation, I-maximality is not fundamental any more.

3.2. Defense related criteria

As the arguments belonging to an extension can be regarded as “surviving the conﬂict together”, the notion of
defense against attacks coming from other arguments has always played an important role in argumentation semantics.
Formally, this has a counterpart in the requirement of admissibility, which lies at the heart of all semantics discussed
in [14] and is based on the well-known notions of acceptable argument and admissible set.

Deﬁnition 10. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), an argument α ∈ A is acceptable with respect to a
set E ⊆ A if and only if ∀β ∈ A: β → α, E → β.

Deﬁnition 11. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set E ⊆ A is admissible if and only if
E is conﬂict-free and ∀β ∈ A: β → E, E → β. The set made up of all the admissible sets of AF will be denoted
as AS(AF).

Deﬁnition 12. A semantics S satisﬁes the admissibility criterion if ∀ AF ∈ DS , ∀E ∈ ES (AF) E ∈ AS(AF), namely:

α ∈ E ⇒ ∀β ∈ parAF(α) E → β

(1)

Condition (1) includes the case where α defends itself against (some of) its defeaters. We suggest that a stronger
notion of defense may also be considered where a node α can not defend itself nor can be involved in its own defense.
To this purpose we introduce the notion of strongly defended argument.

Deﬁnition 13. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), α ∈ A and S ⊆ A, we say that α is strongly de-
fended by S (denoted as sd(α, S)) iff ∀β ∈ parAF(α) ∃γ ∈ S \ {α}: γ → β and sd(γ , S \ {α}).

In words, α is strongly defended by S if S includes a defeater γ (cid:15)= α for any defeater β of α; in turn, γ has to
be strongly defended by S \ α, namely γ needs neither α nor itself to be defended against its defeaters in AF. The
recursion is well founded since, at any step, a set of strictly lesser cardinality is considered. In particular, in case
sd(α, S) the base of this recursive deﬁnition is provided by initial nodes, which are strongly defended by any set since
they have no defeaters. The notion of strong defense is the basis for the deﬁnition of the strong admissibility criterion.

Deﬁnition 14. A semantics S satisﬁes the strong admissibility criterion if ∀ AF ∈ DS , ∀E ∈ ES (AF) it holds that:

α ∈ E ⇒ sd(α, E)

(2)

680

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

The property of reinstatement corresponds to the converse of the implication (1) prescribed by the admissibility
criterion. Intuitively, an argument α is reinstated if its defeaters are in turn defeated and, as a consequence, one
may assume that they should have no effect on the justiﬁcation state of α. Under this assumption, if an extension E
reinstates α then α should belong to E. Formally, this leads to the following reinstatement criterion.

Deﬁnition 15. A semantics S satisﬁes the reinstatement criterion if ∀ AF ∈ DS , ∀E ∈ ES (AF) it holds that:

(cid:2)

∀β ∈ parAF(α) E → β

(cid:3)

⇒ α ∈ E

(3)

Considering the strong notion of defense we obtain a weak (since it is implied by condition (3)) reinstatement

criterion.

Deﬁnition 16. A semantics S satisﬁes the weak reinstatement criterion if ∀ AF ∈ DS , ∀E ∈ ES (AF) it holds that:

sd(α, E) ⇒ α ∈ E

(4)

Another observation concerns the fact that condition (3) prescribes that an argument α defended by an extension
should be included in the extension, without specifying that α should not give rise to conﬂicts within the extension.
To explicitly take into account this aspect, the following CF -reinstatement criterion can be given.

Deﬁnition 17. A semantics S satisﬁes the CF -reinstatement criterion if ∀ AF ∈ DS , ∀E ∈ ES (AF) it holds that:

(cid:2)(cid:2)

∀β ∈ parAF(α) E → β

∧ cf

(cid:3)

(cid:2)
E ∪ {α}

(cid:3)(cid:3)

⇒ α ∈ E

(5)

3.3. The directionality criterion

The notion of directionality in argumentation semantics has ﬁrst been considered in [6], where a general scheme
relating the topology of the defeat graph with the deﬁnition of extensions has been introduced. At an intuitive level,
the idea is quite simple: the justiﬁcation state of an argument α should be affected only by the justiﬁcation state of
the defeaters of α (which in turn are affected by their defeaters and so on), while the arguments which only receive
an attack from α (and in turn those which are attacked by them and so on) should not have any effect on the state
of α. We provide here an extended notion of directionality with respect to [6] by considering a set of arguments not
receiving attacks from outside.

Deﬁnition 18. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set U ⊆ A is unattacked if and only if (cid:2)α ∈
(A \ U ): α → U . The set of unattacked sets of AF is denoted as US(AF).

The directionality criterion can then be deﬁned by requiring an unattacked set to be unaffected by the remaining

parts of the argumentation framework as far as extensions are concerned.

Deﬁnition 19. A semantics S satisﬁes the directionality criterion if and only if ∀ AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ∀U ∈ US(AF),
AE S (AF, U ) = ES (AF↓U ), where AE S (AF, U ) (cid:2) {(E ∩ U ) | E ∈ ES (AF)} ⊆ 2U .

In words, the intersection of any extension prescribed by S for AF with an unattacked set U is equal to one of the

extensions prescribed by S for the restriction of AF to U , and vice versa.

While the deﬁnition of directionality given here refers to a single argumentation framework, it can be easily refor-
mulated as a criterion concerning distinct argumentation frameworks which are equal as far as their restriction to an
unattacked set is concerned.

Proposition 20. A semantics S satisﬁes the directionality criterion if and only if ∀ AF1 = (cid:3)A1, →1(cid:5), ∀ AF2 =
(cid:3)A2, →2(cid:5) such that ∃U ∈ (US(AF1) ∩ US(AF2)): AF1↓U = AF2↓U it holds that

AE S (AF1, U ) = AE S (AF2, U )

(6)

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

681

Proof. Deﬁnition 19 directly implies condition (6) since AE S (AF1, U ) = ES (AF1↓U ) = ES (AF2↓U ) =
AE S (AF2, U ). On the other hand, considering any argumentation framework AF and U ∈ US(AF) we can apply
condition (6) with AF1 = AF and AF2 = AF↓U , obtaining AE S (AF, U ) = AE S (AF↓U , U ) = ES (AF↓U ), since for
any AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) AE S (AF, A) = ES (AF). (cid:2)

4. Skepticism related criteria

The notion of skepticism has often been used in informal or semi-formal ways to discuss semantics behavior, e.g.
by observing that a semantics is “more skeptical” than another one. Intuitively, a semantics is more skeptical than
another if it makes less committed choices about the justiﬁcation state of the arguments. Roughly, the most skeptical
conceivable semantics does not make any commitment on any argument, leaving all of them undecided, while a
semantics is not skeptical at all if it takes a deﬁnite position about every argument in any argumentation framework.

While the issue of skepticism has been considered so far in the literature mostly in the case of comparison between
speciﬁc proposals, we are interested here in a more general analysis. We consider, as a ﬁrst step, a generic relation of
skepticism (cid:19)E between sets of extensions: given two sets of extensions E1, E2 of an argumentation framework AF,
E1 (cid:19)E E2 will simply denote that E1 is at least as skeptical as E2 in some sense. In the context of semantics evaluation,
a skepticism relation (cid:19)E can be used to compare the sets of extensions prescribed by a particular semantics on dif-
ferent but related argumentation frameworks. To this purpose, one ﬁrst needs to deﬁne a skepticism relation between
argumentation frameworks based on the same set of arguments: given two argumentation frameworks AF1 = (cid:3)A, →1(cid:5)
and AF2 = (cid:3)A, →2(cid:5), AF1 (cid:19)A AF2 denotes that AF1 (actually its attack relation) is inherently less committed (to be
precise, not more committed) than AF2. Then, one may reasonably require that any semantics reﬂects in its extensions
the skepticism relations between argumentation frameworks. Requirements of this kind will be called adequacy cri-
teria. On the other hand, a skepticism relation between sets of extensions might also be used to compare the behavior
of different semantics when applied to the same argumentation framework. Comparison between semantics according
to this kind of relations is not considered in this paper and is left for future work.

It is worth noting that the skepticism relations introduced above are not necessarily total orders, since in general
there can be two sets of extensions (or two argumentation frameworks) which are not comparable. Having introduced
skepticism relations at an abstract level, let us examine in the following subsections how they can be concretely
deﬁned.

4.1. Skepticism relations between sets of extensions

Let us start by noting that deﬁning a relation of skepticism between two extensions is intuitively straightforward:
an extension E1 is more skeptical than another extension E2 if and only if E1 ⊆ E2. In fact, a more skeptical attitude
corresponds to a smaller set of arguments surviving the conﬂict. This is actually the relation that can be applied to
compare the behavior of two distinct unique-status semantics, as it is done for ideal and grounded semantics in [15].
Directly extending the above intuition to the comparison of sets of extensions leads to deﬁne the following elementary
skepticism relation (cid:19)E
∩ .

Deﬁnition 21. Given two sets of extensions E1 and E2 of an argumentation framework AF, E1 (cid:19)E

∩ E2 iff

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

E1 ⊆

E2

(7)

E1∈E1

E2∈E2

In words, condition (7) corresponds to the fact that arguments skeptically justiﬁed according to E1 are also skepti-
cally justiﬁed according to E2, which appears to be an essential requirement and provides an intuitive bound for any
relation of skepticism.

Relation (cid:19)E

∩ is based on considerations referring only to skeptically justiﬁed arguments. Finer (and actually
stronger) skepticism relations can be deﬁned by considering relationships of pairwise inclusion between extensions.
As a starting point, we recall that to compare a single extension E1 with a set of extensions E2, the relation ∀E2 ∈ E2
E1 ⊆ E2 has often been used in the literature (for instance to verify that the unique extension prescribed by grounded
semantics is more skeptical than the set of extensions prescribed by preferred semantics). A direct generalization to

682

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

the comparison of two sets of extensions is represented by the following weak skepticism relation (cid:19)E
by the authors in [5].

W , ﬁrst introduced

Deﬁnition 22. Given two sets of extensions E1 and E2 of an argumentation framework AF, E1 (cid:19)E
W

E2 iff

∀E2 ∈ E2 ∃E1 ∈ E1: E1 ⊆ E2

(8)

Relation (cid:19)E

W is unidirectional, since it only constrains the extensions of E2, while E1 may contain additional
extensions unrelated to those of E2. One may then consider also a more symmetric (and stronger) relationship (cid:19)E
S ,
where it is also required that any extension of E1 is included in an extension of E2.

Deﬁnition 23. Given two sets of extensions E1 and E2 of an argumentation framework AF, E1 (cid:19)E
S
the following condition holds:

E2 iff E1 (cid:19)E
W

E2 and

∀E1 ∈ E1 ∃E2 ∈ E2: E1 ⊆ E2

(9)

Having introduced three alternative skepticism relations between sets of extensions, let us now analyze some of
their properties. First, it is immediate to see that the three relations are in strict order of implication. Given two sets of
extensions E1 and E2 of an argumentation framework AF, it holds that:

E1 (cid:19)E
S

E2 ⇒ E1 (cid:19)E
W

E2 ⇒ E1 (cid:19)E

∩ E2

(10)

Then, it can be easily seen (proof is omitted,2 see [5] for a related result) that the relations give rise to a preorder.

Proposition 24. Relations (cid:19)E

∩ , (cid:19)E

W and (cid:19)E

S are preorders, i.e. they are reﬂexive and transitive.

4.2. A skepticism relation between argumentation frameworks

While we are not aware of any deﬁnition of a general skepticism relation for argumentation frameworks in the
literature, some more speciﬁc but related notions have been introduced by the authors in [3] and by Modgil in [18].
The skepticism relation (cid:19)A we propose for argumentation frameworks provides a generalization of these notions,
while relying on the same common intuition concerning the relationship between a mutual and a unidirectional attack
involving two arguments α and β.

To illustrate the intuition discussed in [3], let us consider a very simple argumentation framework including just
two arguments α and β, where α attacks β but not vice versa. This is a situation where the state assignment of
any argumentation semantics corresponds to the maximum level of commitment: it is universally accepted that α
should be justiﬁed and β rejected. Now if we consider a modiﬁed argumentation framework where an attack from
β to α has been added, we obtain a situation where, clearly, a lesser level of commitment is appropriate: given
the mutual attack between the two arguments, neither of them can be assigned a deﬁnitely committed state and we
are left in a more undecided, i.e. more skeptical, situation in absence of any reason for preferring either of them.
Extending this reasoning, consider a couple of arguments α and β in a generic argumentation framework AF(cid:20) such
that α → β while β (cid:15)→ α. Consider now an argumentation framework AF obtained from AF(cid:20) by simply adding an

attack relation from β to α while leaving all the rest unchanged. It seems reasonable to state that AF corresponds to a
more undecided situation with respect to AF(cid:20). In fact, converting a unidirectional attack into a mutual attack can only
make the justiﬁcation states of the involved nodes less committed (of course, they can remain the same if they are
strictly determined by other arguments, independently of the attack relations between α and β). In turn, having α or
β in a less committed state may only give rise to other less committed states in the nodes they attack: intuitively, the
more undecided is the state of an attacker, the more undecided should be the state of the attacked node, and, in turn,
of the nodes attacked by the latter and so on. This reasoning will be generalized here by considering any number of
“transformations” of unidirectional attacks into mutual ones.

Dealing with the case of hierarchical argumentation frameworks but relying on the same intuition, Modgil has
independently introduced in [18] the notion of partial resolution of an argumentation framework AF, which, roughly
speaking, is an argumentation framework AF(cid:20) where some mutual attacks of AF are converted into unidirectional
ones. AF(cid:20) is a (complete) resolution of AF if all mutual attacks of AF are converted. Also in [18] the underlying idea
is that the presence of mutual attacks corresponds to a more undecided situation.

Given these bases, we are now ready to deﬁne a skepticism relation (cid:19)A between argumentation frameworks based
on the same set of arguments, which requires a preliminary notation concerning the set of conﬂicting pairs of argu-
ments in an argumentation framework.

Deﬁnition 26. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), CON F(AF) (cid:2) {(α, β) ∈ A × A | α → β ∨ β → α}.

Deﬁnition 27. Given two argumentation frameworks AF1 = (cid:3)A, →1(cid:5) and AF2 = (cid:3)A, →2(cid:5), AF1 (cid:19)A AF2 if and only
if CON F(AF1) = CON F(AF2) and →2 ⊆ →1.

It is easy to see that the above deﬁnition covers all cases where some (possibly none) mutual attacks of AF1
correspond to unidirectional attacks in AF2, while unidirectional attacks of AF1 are the same in AF2 (using the
terminology of [18], AF2 is a partial resolution of AF1).

It is immediate to see that (cid:19)A is a partial order, as it consists of an equality and a set inclusion relation. Comparable
argumentation frameworks feature the same set of arguments and the same set of conﬂicting pairs of arguments, and
can not include opposite unidirectional attacks between the same pair of arguments. It is also worth noting that within
the set of argumentation frameworks comparable with a given AF there are, in general, several maximal elements with
respect to (cid:19)A, namely all argumentation frameworks where no mutual attack is present (corresponding to the notion
of resolution in [18]). In the following we will denote as RES(AF) the set of argumentation frameworks comparable
with AF and maximal with respect to (cid:19)A.

4.3. Skepticism adequacy

Given an argumentation framework which is more skeptical than another one, it is reasonable to require that,
when applying the same semantics to both, the skepticism relation between them is preserved between their sets of
extensions. This kind of criterion, called skepticism adequacy, has ﬁrst been proposed in [3] and is formulated here in
a generalized version.

Deﬁnition 28. Given a skepticism relation (cid:19)E between sets of extensions, a semantics S is (cid:19)E-skepticism-adequate,
denoted as SA(cid:19)E (S), if and only if for any pair of argumentation frameworks AF, AF(cid:20) such that AF (cid:19)A AF(cid:20) the
following condition holds ES (AF) (cid:19)E ES (AF(cid:20)).

According to the deﬁnitions provided in Section 4.1 we have three skepticism adequacy properties, related by the

same order of implication as in (10):

SA(cid:19)E

S

(S) ⇒ SA(cid:19)E

W

(S) ⇒ SA(cid:19)E

∩

(S)

(11)

It is easy to see that Deﬁnition 28 is equivalent to the one given in [3] where the modiﬁcation of just one attack

relation is considered, provided that, as in our case, skepticism relations are transitive.

684

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

Proposition 29. Given a transitive skepticism relation (cid:19)E between sets of extensions and a semantics S, SA(cid:19)E (S) if
and only if for any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), for any α, β ∈ A: α (cid:15)= β ∧ α → β,

ES (AF

(cid:2)(α,β)) (cid:19)E ES (AF)

where AF(cid:2)(α,β) = (cid:3)A, → ∪{(β, α)}(cid:5).

(12)

Proof. Clearly (cid:19)E-skepticism adequacy implies (12) as a special case. On the other hand, for any pair of argumenta-
tion frameworks AF, AF(cid:20) such that AF (cid:19)A AF(cid:20), it is clearly possible to construct at least one sequence AF1, . . . , AFn
(cid:2)(αi ,βi ). Then if (12)
such that AF1 = AF, AFn = AF(cid:20), and for i = 1, . . . , n − 1, ∃αi, βi ∈ A such that AFi = AFi+1
holds, we have ES (AF) = ES (AF1) (cid:19)E · · · (cid:19)E ES (AFn) = ES (AF(cid:20)), and, by transitivity, ES (AF) (cid:19)E ES (AF(cid:20)). (cid:2)

4.4. Resolution adequacy

In the context of hierarchical argumentation frameworks, the following requirement for an argumentation semantics

S is proposed in [18] for any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and for any argument α ∈ A:

α ∈

E ⇔ ∀ AF

(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) α ∈

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

E∈ES (AF)

E

E∈ES (AF(cid:20))

(13)

It can be seen that the ⇒-part of (13) is a special case of the skepticism adequacy criterion of Deﬁnition 28, where,
∩ is

among the argumentation frameworks AF(cid:20) such that AF (cid:19)A AF(cid:20), only the maximal ones are considered and (cid:19)E
selected as the skepticism relation (cid:19)E between sets of extensions.

On the other hand, the ⇐-part of (13) represents an original criterion, relying on the intuition that if an argument
is skeptically justiﬁed in all possible resolutions of an argumentation framework AF then it should be skeptically
justiﬁed in AF too. We refer to this criterion as resolution adequacy and provide now a generalization of its original
formulation, in order to make it parametric with respect to skepticism relations between sets of extensions. In fact,
ES (AF(cid:20)), it can be seen that the ⇐-part of (13) is equivalent to UR(AF, S) (cid:19)E
letting UR(AF, S) =
∩
ES (AF). Generalizing this condition leads to a parametric formulation of the resolution adequacy criterion.

Deﬁnition 30. Given a skepticism relation (cid:19)E between sets of extensions, a semantics S is (cid:19)E-resolution adequate,
denoted RA(cid:19)E (S), if and only if for any argumentation framework AF it holds that UR(AF, S) (cid:19)E ES (AF).

According to the deﬁnitions in Section 4.1, we have three resolution adequacy properties, related by the usual order

of implication:

5. A review of extension-based argumentation semantics

(14)

To make the paper self-contained, in this section we review the deﬁnition of several argumentation semantics which

will be evaluated against the criteria deﬁned in previous sections.

5.1. Traditional semantics

Stable semantics, one of the earliest multiple-status approaches and still largely adopted in several application
domains, relies on the idea that an extension should not only be internally consistent but also able to reject the
arguments that are outside the extension. This reasoning leads to the notion of stable extension [14,23].

Deﬁnition 31. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set E ⊆ A is a stable extension of AF if and only
if E is conﬂict-free and ∀α ∈ A: α /∈ E, E → α.

Stable semantics will be denoted as ST , and, accordingly, the set of all the stable extensions of AF will be denoted

as EST (AF).

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

685

Fig. 1. A three-length cycle.

Stable semantics suffers from a signiﬁcant limitation since there are argumentation frameworks, like the one shown
in Fig. 1, where no extension complying with Deﬁnition 31 exists. No other semantics considered in this paper is
affected by this problem except the prudent version of stable semantics.

The requirement that an extension should attack all other external arguments can be relaxed by imposing that an
extension is simply able to defend itself from external attacks. This is at the basis of the notions of acceptable argument
and admissible set [14], already recalled in Section 3.2. The set of the arguments acceptable with respect to a set E is
traditionally denoted using the characteristic function FAF(E).

Deﬁnition 32. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), the function FAF : 2A → 2A which, given a set
E ⊆ A, returns the set of the acceptable arguments with respect to E, is called the characteristic function of AF.

Building on these concepts, the notion of complete extension can be introduced, which plays a key role in Dung’s

theory, since all semantics encompassed by his framework select their extensions among the complete ones.

Deﬁnition 33. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set E ⊆ A is a complete extension if and only if E
is admissible and every argument of A which is acceptable with respect to E belongs to E, i.e. E ∈ AS(AF) ∧ ∀α ∈
FAF(E) α ∈ E.

The notion of complete extension does not entail the property of I-maximality. In fact, Deﬁnition 33 only establishes
that nodes already defended by an extension E are included in E, but does not impose that nodes (or sets of nodes)
that defend themselves are added to the extension. Probably for this reason, the notion of complete extension is not
associated to a notion of complete semantics in [14], but rather represents an intermediate step towards the deﬁnition
of grounded and preferred semantics. However, the term complete semantics has subsequently gained acceptance in
the literature (see for instance [9,18]) and will be used in the present analysis to refer to the properties of the set of
complete extensions. Complete semantics will be denoted as CO.

The well-known grounded semantics, denoted as GR, belongs to the unique-status approach and its unique exten-

sion, denoted as GE(AF), can be deﬁned as the least ﬁxed point of the characteristic function.

Deﬁnition 34. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), the grounded extension of AF, denoted as GE(AF),
is the least (with respect to set inclusion) ﬁxed point of FAF.

Preferred semantics, denoted as PR, is obtained by simply requiring the property of maximality along with ad-

missibility.

Deﬁnition 35. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set E ⊆ A is a preferred extension of AF if and
only if it is a maximal (with respect to set inclusion) admissible set, i.e. a maximal element of AS(AF).

5.2. SCC-recursiveness and CF2 semantics

In [6] a general schema for argumentation semantics, called SCC-recursiveness, has been introduced. SCC-
recursiveness is a property of the extensions which relies on the graph theoretical notion of strongly connected
components (SCCs).

686

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

Deﬁnition 36. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), the binary relation of path-equivalence between
nodes, denoted as PEAF ⊆ (A × A), is deﬁned as follows:

• ∀α ∈ A, (α, α) ∈ PEAF;
• given two distinct nodes α, β ∈ A, (α, β) ∈ PEAF if and only if there is a (directed) path from α to β and a

(directed) path from β to α.

The strongly connected components of AF are the equivalence classes of nodes under the relation of path-equivalence.
The set of the SCCs of AF is denoted as SCCSAF.

A particular case is represented by the empty argumentation framework: when AF = (cid:3)∅, ∅(cid:5) we assume

SCCSAF = {∅}.

We extend to SCCs the notion of parents, namely the set of the other SCCs that attack a SCC S, which is denoted

as sccparAF(S), and we introduce the deﬁnition of proper ancestors, denoted as sccancAF(S).

Deﬁnition 37. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a SCC S ∈ SCCSAF, we deﬁne sccparAF(S) =
{P ∈ SCCSAF | P (cid:15)= S and P → S} and sccancAF(S) = sccparAF(S) ∪ (
P ∈sccparAF(S) sccancAF(P )). A SCC S such
that sccparAF(S) = ∅ is called initial.

(cid:5)

It is well-known that the graph obtained by considering SCCs as single nodes is acyclic. In other words, SCCs
can be partially ordered according to the relation of attack and initial SCCs are those which are not preceded by any
other one in this partial order. Of course, in any argumentation framework there is at least one initial SCC. This fact
lies at the heart of the deﬁnition of SCC-recursiveness, which is based on the intuition that extensions can be built
incrementally starting from initial SCCs and following the above mentioned partial order. In other words, the choices
concerning extension construction carried out in an initial SCC do not depend on those concerning the other ones,
while they directly affect the choices about the subsequent SCCs and so on. While the basic underlying intuition
is rather simple, the formalization of SCC-recursiveness is admittedly rather complex and involves some additional
notions. To keep the size of the paper within reasonable limits, we can only quickly recall the relevant deﬁnitions here,
while referring the reader to [6] for more details and examples.

First of all, the choices (represented in the following deﬁnition by the set E) within the proper ancestor SCCs

determine a partition of the nodes of a generic SCC S into three subsets.

Deﬁnition 38. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set E ⊆ A and a strongly connected component
S ∈ SCCSAF, we deﬁne:

• DAF(S, E) = {α ∈ S | (E ∩ outparAF(S)) → α};
• PAF(S, E) = {α ∈ S | (E ∩ outparAF(S)) (cid:15)→ α ∧ ∃β ∈ (outparAF(S) ∩ parAF(α)): E (cid:15)→ β};
• UAF(S, E) = S \ (DAF(S, E) ∪ PAF(S, E)) = {α ∈ S | (E ∩ outparAF(S)) (cid:15)→ α ∧ ∀β ∈ (outparAF(S) ∩

parAF(α)) E → β}.

Regarding E as a part of an extension which is being constructed, the idea is that arguments in DAF(S, E), being
attacked by nodes in E, cannot be chosen in the construction of the extension E (i.e. do not belong to E ∩ S). Selection
of arguments to be included in E is therefore restricted to (S \DAF(S, E)) = (UAF(S, E)∪PAF(S, E)), which, for ease
of notation, will be denoted in the following as UPAF(S, E). Then, inspired by the reinstatement principle, we require
the selection of nodes within a SCC S to be carried out on the restricted argumentation framework AF↓UPAF(S,E)
without taking into account the attacks coming from DAF(S, E). Combining these ideas and skipping some details
not strictly necessary in the context of the present paper, we can ﬁnally recall the deﬁnition of SCC-recursiveness.

Deﬁnition 39. A given argumentation semantics S is SCC-recursive if and only if for any argumentation framework
AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) ES (AF) = GF(AF, A), where for any AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and for any set C ⊆ A, the function GF(AF,
C) ⊆ 2A is deﬁned as follows: for any E ⊆ A, E ∈ GF(AF, C) if and only if

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

687

• in case | SCCSAF | = 1, E ∈ BF S (AF, C),
• otherwise, ∀S ∈ SCCSAF (E ∩ S) ∈ GF(AF↓UPAF(S,E), UAF(S, E) ∩ C),

where BF S (AF, C) is a function, called base function, that, given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) such
that | SCCSAF | = 1 and a set C ⊆ A, gives a subset of 2A.

All SCC-recursive semantics “share” this general scheme and only differ by the speciﬁc base function adopted.
It has been shown in [6] that all semantics encompassed by Dung’s framework are SCC-recursive and the relevant
base functions have been identiﬁed. Moreover, deﬁning and experimenting new SCC-recursive semantics is quite easy
since it simply amounts to deﬁning a base function operating on single-SCC argumentation frameworks. As shown in
[6], the base function has only to respect two very simple conditions in order to ensure that the resulting extensions
satisfy the requirements of being conﬂict-free and of being a superset of the grounded extension.

Four original SCC-recursive semantics have been deﬁned in [6]. In particular, the SCC-recursive semantics called
CF2 [2,6] can be regarded as the most promising, since it has been shown to provide an interesting behavior in several
critical examples. Its deﬁnition relies on a very simple base function: BF CF2(AF, C) = MCF AF, where MCF AF
denotes the set made up of all the maximal conﬂict-free sets of AF (note that the parameter C plays no role at all in
this case). We recall here an important result to be used in the following.

Lemma 40. (See Lemma 2 of [3].) For any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) ECF2(AF) ⊆ MCF AF.

In words, for a generic argumentation framework AF any extension prescribed by CF2 semantics is a maximal

conﬂict-free set of AF (but not vice versa).

5.3. Semi-stable semantics

Semi-stable semantics [9], denoted in the following as SST , aims at guaranteeing the existence of extensions in any
case (differently from stable semantics) while coinciding with stable semantics (differently from preferred semantics)
when stable extensions exist. The deﬁnition of extensions satisfying these desiderata is ingeniously simple.

Deﬁnition 41. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) a set E ⊆ A is a semi-stable extension if and only if
E is a complete extension such that E ∪ outchildAF(E) is maximal with respect to set inclusion.

5.4. Ideal semantics

Ideal semantics [15] provides an alternative unique-status approach which is less skeptical than grounded seman-
tics, i.e. for any argumentation framework the (unique) ideal extension is a (sometimes strict) superset of the grounded
extension. Also in this case the deﬁnition is quite simple.

Deﬁnition 42. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) a set E ⊆ A is ideal if and only if E is admissible
and ∀P ∈ EPR(AF) E ⊆ P . The ideal extension is the maximal (with respect to set inclusion) ideal set.

We will use the symbol ID to refer to the ideal semantics, and the ideal extension of an argumentation framework

AF will be denoted as ID(AF).

5.5. Prudent semantics

Prudent semantics [12,13] emphasizes the role of indirect attacks.

Deﬁnition 43. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), an argument α indirectly attacks another argument
β, denoted as α (cid:5)→ β, if there is an odd-length path from α to β in the defeat graph corresponding to AF. A set S is
without indirect conﬂicts, denoted as icf (S), if and only if (cid:2)α, β ∈ S: α (cid:5)→ β.

688

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

Forbidding indirect attacks leads to the deﬁnition of p(rudent)-admissible sets.

Deﬁnition 44. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set of arguments S ⊆ A is p(rudent)-admissible if
and only if ∀α ∈ S α is acceptable with respect to S and icf (S).

On this basis, the prudent version of several traditional notions of extensions (and of the relevant semantics) has

been deﬁned.

Deﬁnition 45. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), a set of arguments S ⊆ A is:

• a preferred p-extension if and only if S is a maximal (with respect to set inclusion) p-admissible set;
• a stable p-extension if and only if icf (S) and ∀α ∈ (A \ S) S → α;
• a complete p-extension if and only if S is p-admissible and there is no argument α /∈ S such that α is acceptable

with respect to S and icf (S ∪ {α}).

As to the prudent version of grounded semantics, ﬁrst the notion of p(rudent)-characteristic function is needed.

Deﬁnition 46. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), Fp
AF, is deﬁned as follows: given a set S ⊆ A, Fp

AF : 2A → 2A, called p-characteristic function of
AF(S) = {α ∈ A | α is acceptable with respect to S and icf (S ∪ {α})}.

In general Fp
AF(∅), i ∈ N, is monotonic, where Fp,1
Fp,i
lowing deﬁnition is given in [12].

AF is not monotonic with respect to set inclusion, one can rely however on the fact that the sequence
(S)), i > 1. Accordingly, the fol-

AF(S), and Fp,i

AF(S) = Fp

AF (S) = Fp

AF(Fp,i−1

AF

Deﬁnition 47. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), let j be the lowest integer such that the sequence
AF(∅) is stationary for i (cid:3) j . Then Fp,j
Fp,i

AF (∅) is the grounded p-extension of AF, denoted as GPE(AF).

The prudent versions of grounded, complete, preferred and stable semantics will be denoted as GRP, COP, PRP

and ST P, respectively.

6. Evaluating semantics

In this section we discuss the application of the evaluation criteria presented in Section 3 and of the adequacy
criteria introduced in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 to the semantics reviewed in Section 5. A synthetic view of the results is
given in Table 1 (for criteria deﬁned in Section 3) and Table 2 (for adequacy criteria).

6.1. I-maximality

As mentioned in Section 3.1, the I-maximality criterion is necessarily satisﬁed by any unique-status semantics,
therefore in particular by grounded, ideal and grounded prudent semantics. The deﬁnition of preferred and preferred

prudent extensions explicitly requires maximality of sets, which obviously entails I-maximality. This extends to semi-
stable semantics too, as it is proved in [9] that every semi-stable extension is also a preferred extension. Any stable (or
stable prudent) extension E attacks any argument α /∈ E, therefore any strict superset of E is not conﬂict-free, again
entailing I-maximality. As to CF2 semantics, Lemma 40 directly implies I-maximality. Finally, as already mentioned
in Section 5.1, it is easy to see that the set of complete (and analogously complete prudent) extensions does not satisfy
I-maximality in general.

6.2. Admissibility and reinstatement

Any complete extension satisﬁes, by Deﬁnition 33, the properties of admissibility (1) and reinstatement (3) (which
in turn entails weak (4) and CF (5) reinstatement). As a consequence, any semantics whose extensions are complete
extensions (grounded, preferred, stable, semi-stable, stable prudent) satisﬁes these properties as well.

The ideal extension satisﬁes admissibility directly by Deﬁnition 42. We prove now that it satisﬁes reinstatement

(and therefore also its weaker versions).

Proposition 48. For any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), for any argument α such that ∀β ∈ parAF(α)
ID(AF) → β, it holds that α ∈ ID(AF).

Proof. Suppose by contradiction that ∃α /∈ ID(AF) such that ∀β ∈ parAF(α), ID(AF) → β. Note that since ID(AF) is
admissible and attacks all the defeaters of α by Dung’s fundamental lemma [14] it must be the case that ID(AF) ∪ {α}
is admissible. Then the absurd hypothesis may only hold if α is not included in the intersection of the preferred exten-
sions of AF, namely ∃E ∈ EPR(AF): α /∈ E. However, ∀E ∈ EPR(AF) E ∪ {α} is admissible by Dung’s fundamental
lemma, since E is admissible and ID(AF) ⊆ E, thus ∀β ∈ parAF(α) E → β. This contradicts the fact that E, being a
preferred extension, is a maximal admissible set. (cid:2)

While the semantics examined so far satisfy admissibility and all forms of reinstatement at the same time, this is
not the case for the remaining semantics. Let us consider admissibility ﬁrst. Preferred prudent and complete prudent
semantics satisfy admissibility (which is implied by p-admissibility) by Deﬁnition 45. The grounded prudent seman-
tics satisﬁes it too, since it also satisﬁes strong admissibility, as it will be seen later. On the other hand, CF2 semantics
does not satisfy admissibility, as it can be seen by considering the argumentation framework shown in Fig. 1, which
consists of a single strongly connected component. Then ECF2(AF) = BF CF2(AF, A) = MCF AF = {{α}, {β}, {γ }}:
clearly, none of these extensions is an admissible set.

Turning to reinstatement, a single example, taken from [13], rules it out (even in weaker forms) for the prudent

versions of complete, grounded and preferred semantics. Considering Fig. 2, we have that:

• {α, (cid:6)} is a preferred p-extension as it is maximal p-admissible (δ cannot be included as it indirectly conﬂicts with

α);

• {α, (cid:6)} is also a complete p-extension for the same reason;
• {δ, (cid:6)} is the grounded p-extension, in fact Fp

added as it indirectly conﬂicts with δ.

AF(∅) = {δ, (cid:6)} = Fp,i

AF(∅) for any i since, in particular, α cannot be

Fig. 2. Direct and indirect attacks.

Then it is evident that an initial argument (in this case δ) is not included in a preferred (and complete) prudent
extension: this is incompatible with any form of reinstatement. The grounded prudent extension necessarily includes
the initial nodes, but in this example it excludes the argument α which is strongly defended by the extension itself and
is not in (direct) conﬂict with it. Therefore also in this case no form of reinstatement is satisﬁed.

Turning to CF2 semantics, the already mentioned example of Fig. 1 also shows that reinstatement is violated.
Considering for instance the extension {α} we have that all the defeaters of γ (actually β) are attacked by the exten-
sion, however γ does not belong to the extension. On the other hand, CF2 semantics satisﬁes both weaker forms of
reinstatement. As to CF -reinstatement, by Lemma 40 it is easy to see that CF2 semantics satisﬁes condition (5) since
any extension satisﬁes the stronger condition cf (E ∪ {α}) ⇒ α ∈ E. As to weak reinstatement, it is known [6] that
∀E ∈ ECF2(AF) GE(AF) ⊆ E: then (4) follows from Proposition 50(b).

To conclude this section, let us turn to strong admissibility, i.e. condition (2). It is easy to see that this condition

holds for grounded semantics.

Proposition 49. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ∀α ∈ GE(AF) sd(α, GE(AF)).

AF(∅)) and sd(β, GE(AF)). (cid:2)

It is also interesting to note that this notion, in combination with the dual property of weak reinstatement (4) can
be used for a defense-based characterization of the grounded semantics, which, as to our knowledge, has not been
previously provided in the literature. First, Proposition 50 shows that, for a given semantics S, satisfying condition
(4) is equivalent to the property of agreement with grounded semantics, i.e. for any argumentation framework AF and
∀E ∈ ES (AF) GE(AF) ⊆ E.

Proposition 50. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a set E ⊆ A, E satisﬁes condition (4) if and
only if GE(AF) ⊆ E.

Proof. (a) (4) ⇒ GE(AF) ⊆ E.

AF (∅)) and Fi−1
(b) GE(AF) ⊆ E ⇒ (4).
We prove that assuming ∃α /∈ GE(AF): sd(α, E) yields a contradiction, which entails the desired conclusion since
GE(AF) ⊆ E. By assumption, ∀β ∈ parAF(α), ∃γ ∈ E \ {α}: γ → β ∧ sd(γ , E \ {α}). Since GE(AF) is a complete
extension, it must be the case that one of such γ exists with γ /∈ GE(AF), otherwise α ∈ GE(AF). Thus, in particular
∃γ /∈ GE(AF): sd(γ , E \ {α}), where GE(AF) ⊆ (E \ {α}). Now, iterating the same kind of reasoning on γ we are led
to consider an argument γ (cid:20) ∈ E \ {α, γ }: sd(γ (cid:20), E \ {α, γ }) ∧ γ (cid:20) /∈ GE(AF). This in turn leads to consider an argument
γ (cid:20)(cid:20) ∈ E \ {α, γ , γ (cid:20)}: sd(γ (cid:20)(cid:20), E \ {α, γ , γ (cid:20)}) ∧ γ (cid:20)(cid:20) /∈ GE(AF), and so on. In summary we are led to consider an inﬁnite
sequence of distinct arguments within E, which is impossible due to the ﬁniteness of A. (cid:2)

On the other hand, condition (2) implies that an extension E is included in the grounded extension.

Proposition 51. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a set E ⊆ A, if E satisﬁes condition (2) then
E ⊆ GE(AF).

Proof. We prove that assuming ∃α /∈ GE(AF): sd(α, E) yields a contradiction, which by condition (2) entails the
conclusion E ⊆ GE(AF). Note ﬁrst that, by assumption, ∃β ∈ A: β → α, since initial nodes belong to GE(AF).
Then, according to (2), for any such β there must be an argument γ ∈ E \ {α}: γ → β ∧ sd(γ , E \ {α}). As in the
proof of Proposition 50(b), it must be the case that for at least one of these γ , γ /∈ GE(AF), and we are led to consider
an inﬁnite sequence of distinct arguments within E, which is impossible. (cid:2)

Propositions above show that the conjunction of weak reinstatement and strong admissibility provides a charac-
terization of grounded semantics. In particular, any semantics whose extensions are not included in the grounded
extension can not satisfy strong admissibility. For instance, considering the simple example of mutual attack (often
called Nixon diamond) corresponding to the argumentation framework AF = (cid:3){α, β}, {(α, β), (β, α)}(cid:5), any multiple-
status semantics S such that ES (AF) ⊇ {{α}, {β}} violates condition (2). This immediately rules out complete, stable,
preferred, CF2, semi-stable, complete prudent, stable prudent and preferred prudent semantics. Also ideal seman-
tics does not satisfy (2) since there are cases where GE(AF) (cid:3) ID(AF). For instance, in the example of Fig. 3
EPR(AF) = {{α, δ}, {β, δ}}, then ID(AF) = {δ} which is admissible and included in both preferred extensions. How-
ever, GE(AF) = ∅.

Finally, it can be shown (proof is omitted) that the grounded prudent extension GPE(AF) satisﬁes strong admissi-

bility.

Proposition 52. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ∀α ∈ GPE(AF) sd(α, GPE(AF)).

6.3. Directionality

To begin our analysis, we prove that the directionality criterion is satisﬁed by all SCC-recursive semantics such
that for any argumentation framework the existence of extensions is guaranteed. This covers the cases of grounded,
complete, and preferred semantics, whose SCC-recursiveness has been proved in [6], and of CF2 semantics, which,
as recalled in Section 5.2, is directly deﬁned in SCC-recursive terms. Two preliminary lemmata, whose easy proof is
omitted, are required.

Lemma 53. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a set U ∈ US(AF), ∀S ∈ SCCSAF: (S ∩ U ) (cid:15)= ∅,
S ⊆ U . Then ∃Q ⊆ SCCSAF: U =

(cid:5)

S∈Q S.

Lemma 54. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ∀U ∈ US(AF) ∀S ∈ SCCSAF, S ⊆ U ⇒
(cid:5)
(

S(cid:20)∈sccancAF(S) S(cid:20)) ⊆ U .

Proposition 55. Any SCC-recursive semantics S such that ∀ AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) ∀C ⊆ A BFS (AF, C) (cid:15)= ∅, satisﬁes the
directionality criterion.

692

Fig. 4. Stable semantics does not satisfy directionality.

Proof. By Deﬁnition 39 it holds that for any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5):

(cid:6)

ES (AF) =

E ⊆ A: ∀S ∈ SCCSAF(E ∩ S) ∈ GF

(cid:2)
AF↓U PAF(S,E), UAF(S, E)

(cid:3)(cid:7)

(15)

Considering a generic unattacked set U ∈ US(AF), from Lemma 53 we know that ∃Q ⊆ SCCSAF: U =

S∈Q S
and from Lemma 54 that ∀S ∈ Q sccancAF(S) ⊆ Q. It follows that SCCSAF↓U
= Q. Then ES (AF↓U ) = {E ⊆
U : ∀S ∈ Q (E ∩ S) ∈ GF((AF↓U )↓UPAF↓
U (S,E),
UAF↓U (S, E))}. Now, since ∀S ∈ Q sccancAF(S) ⊆ Q, it is easy to see that ∀E ⊆ U , ∀S ∈ Q, the following equalities
hold since the restriction to U does not introduce any difference with respect to the whole AF as far as the relevant
sets are concerned: UPAF↓U (S, E) = UPAF(S, E) and UAF↓U (S, E) = UAF(S, E). Then

U (S,E), UAF↓U (S, E))} = {E ⊆ U : ∀S ∈ Q (E ∩ S) ∈ GF(AF↓UPAF↓

(cid:5)

ES (AF↓U ) =

(cid:6)
E ⊆ U : ∀S ∈ Q (E ∩ S) ∈ GF

(cid:2)
AF ↓U PAF(S,E), UAF(S, E)

(cid:3)(cid:7)

(16)

According to Deﬁnition 19, we have now to show that AE S (AF, U ) = ES (AF↓U ), where AE S (AF, U ) = {E ∩
U : E ∈ ES (AF)}. If E ∈ ES (AF) then from (15) and taking into account that ∀S ∈ Q UPAF(S, E) and UAF(S, E) only
depend on E ∩U rather than E, it is easy to derive that ∀S ∈ Q ((E ∩U )∩S) ∈ GF(AF↓UPAF(S,E∩U ), UAF(S, E ∩U )),
which, using (16), yields (E ∩ U ) ∈ ES (AF↓U ). On the other hand, if E(cid:20) ∈ ES (AF↓U ) then by (16) it satisﬁes
condition (15) as far as any strongly connected component S ∈ Q is concerned. Then we have to show that ∃E∗
such that (E∗ ∩ U ) = E(cid:20) with E∗ satisfying the deﬁnition of SCC-recursiveness also for any S(cid:20) ∈ (SCCSAF \Q). But
since ∀ AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) ∀C ⊆ A, BF S (AF, C) is deﬁned, it is clearly possible to construct such a set E∗ (in general,
more than one exist) by applying Deﬁnition 39 to the strongly connected components not included in Q following the
(partial) order induced among them by the attack relation (note that by Lemma 54 no strongly connected component
in (SCCSAF \Q) can precede any strongly connected component in Q in this order). (cid:2)

Stable semantics, while being SCC-recursive [6], does not satisfy the hypothesis of Proposition 55. In fact, it does
not satisfy the directionality criterion as it can be seen considering Fig. 4, where EST (AF) = {{β}} and therefore
AE ST (AF, {α, β}) = {{β}}, while EST (AF↓{α,β}) = {{α}, {β}}. Since in this example both semi-stable and stable
prudent semantics behave as stable semantics, neither of them satisﬁes directionality.

Recalling the argumentation framework of Fig. 2 and the fact that {α, (cid:6)} is both a preferred p- and complete p-
extension where the initial argument δ is not included, we immediately see that directionality is satisﬁed neither by
preferred prudent nor by complete prudent semantics. As to grounded prudent semantics, it is easy to see that it
satisﬁes directionality as, according to Deﬁnition 47, the grounded p-extension can be conceived as the result of a
constructive process starting from initial arguments, where inclusion of an argument only depends on its ancestors.

Finally, Proposition 58, which requires two preliminary lemmata whose proof is omitted, shows that the ideal

semantics satisﬁes the directionality criterion.

Lemma 56. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ∀U ∈ US(AF) it holds that

• for any E ⊆ A such that E ∈ AS(AF), E ∩ U ∈ AS(AF↓U );
• for any E ⊆ U such that E ∈ AS(AF↓U ), E ∈ AS(AF).

Lemma 57. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), ID(AF) =

(cid:5)

E∈AS(AF): ∀P ∈EPR(AF)E⊆P E.

Proposition 58. Ideal semantics satisﬁes the directionality criterion.

Proof. We have to prove that for any argumentation framework AF and for any U ∈ US(AF), ID(AF) ∩ U =
ID(AF↓U ). On the basis of Lemma 57, we have to show that

E∈AS(AF): ∀P ∈EPR(AF) E⊆P

E∈AS(AF↓U ): ∀P ∈EPR(AF↓U ) E⊆P

First, let us show that the set on the left-hand side of the last equality is a subset of the set on the right-hand side.
By Lemma 56, if E ∈ AS(AF) then (E ∩ U ) ∈ AS(AF↓U ). Moreover, ∀P ∈ EPR(AF) (E ∩ U ) ⊆ (P ∩ U ). Since
preferred semantics satisﬁes directionality we have that {P ∩ U | P ∈ EPR(AF)} = EPR(AF↓U ), from which it
follows that ∀P ∈ EPR(AF↓U ) (E ∩ U ) ⊆ P . To see that, vice versa, the set on the right-hand side of the equality
is a subset of the set on the left-hand side, recall that by Lemma 56 if E ∈ AS(AF↓U ) then E is also admissible in
AF. Exploiting again the directionality of preferred semantics it is ﬁnally easy to see that ∀P ∈ EPR(AF↓U ) E ⊆ P
implies also that ∀P ∈ EPR(AF) E ⊆ P . (cid:2)

6.4. Skepticism adequacy

In Section 4.3 three skepticism adequacy properties, ordered by implication, have been deﬁned. First let us show
that grounded semantics satisﬁes all of them (note that we refer to the equivalent condition stated in Proposition 29,
as we will do also in some of the following proofs).

Lemma 59. Let us consider an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) with two arguments α, β ∈ A such that α →
β. For any two sets of arguments A∗ and A such that A∗ ⊆ A and A is admissible in AF, FAF(cid:2)(α,β)(A∗) ⊆ FAF(A).
Proof. Considering a generic γ ∈ FAF(cid:2)(α,β)(A∗), we have to prove that γ ∈ FAF(A), i.e. that γ is acceptable with
respect to A in AF. To this purpose, let us consider a generic argument δ ∈ parAF(γ ), and let us prove that A → δ in
AF. By deﬁnition of AF(cid:2)(α,β), it is easy to see that δ ∈ parAF(cid:2)(α,β)(γ ), and since γ ∈ FAF(cid:2)(α,β)(A∗) it must be the
case that A∗ → δ holds in AF(cid:2)(α,β). Since A∗ ⊆ A, A → δ in AF(cid:2)(α,β), i.e. ∃(cid:6) ∈ A: (cid:6) → δ in AF(cid:2)(α,β). Now, we
have two cases to consider. If it is not the case that β = (cid:6) and α = δ then, by deﬁnition of AF(cid:2)(α,β), (cid:6) → δ also in AF
and the claim is proved. Otherwise, β = (cid:6) and α = δ, then, by the hypothesis that α → β in AF it follows that δ → A
in AF, which, by admissibility of A, entails that, also in this case, A → δ in AF. (cid:2)

Proposition 60. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and two arguments α, β ∈ A such that α → β, we
have that GE(AF(cid:2)(α,β)) ⊆ GE(AF).

AF(cid:2)(α,β)(∅) ⊆
Proof. Taking into account the deﬁnition of grounded extension, it is sufﬁcient to prove that ∀i (cid:3) 1 Fi
AF(∅). This can be easily proved by induction on i, taking into account Lemma 59 and the fact that ∀i (cid:3) 1 Fi
AF(∅) is
Fi
admissible [14]. In particular, in the basis case Lemma 59 can be applied with A∗ = A = ∅ to prove that FAF(cid:2)(α,β)(∅) ⊆
FAF(∅), while in the induction step it can be applied with A∗ = Fi
AF(∅), where A∗ ⊆ A is
inductively assumed, to prove that Fi+1

AF(cid:2)(α,β) (∅) and A = Fi

AF(cid:2)(α,β) (∅) ⊆ Fi+1

AF (∅). (cid:2)

Since grounded semantics belongs to the unique-status approach, it is immediate to see that the result of Propo-
sition 60 entails the satisfaction of all skepticism adequacy properties including its strongest form, based on (cid:19)E
S .
On the other hand, it is easy to see that (cid:19)E
S -skepticism adequacy is in contrast with the behavior of most se-
mantics in the simple case of mutually attacking arguments. In fact, letting AF1 = (cid:3){α, β}, {(α, β)}(cid:5) and AF2 =
(cid:2)(α,β) = (cid:3){α, β}, {(α, β), (β, α)}(cid:5), any multiple-status semantics S such that (as usual) ES (AF1) = {{α}} and
AF1
ES (AF2) ⊇ {{α}, {β}} does not satisfy (cid:19)E
S -skepticism adequacy. This rules out all the remaining semantics except
ideal and grounded prudent semantics, which however will be shown to fail to satisfy any form of skepticism ade-
quacy.

Fig. 5. Several semantics are not skepticism adequate.

(cid:19)E

W -skepticism adequacy (along with the implied weaker form (cid:19)E

∩ ) turns out to be a more reasonable requirement,
which we now show to be satisﬁed by complete, stable and CF2 semantics. Proposition 61 provides the result for
complete semantics.

Proposition 61. Given two argumentation frameworks AF1 = (cid:3)A, →1(cid:5) and AF2 = (cid:3)A, →2(cid:5) such that AF1 (cid:19)A AF2,
ECO(AF1) (cid:19)E
W

ECO(AF2).

Proof. We have to show that ∀E2 ∈ ECO(AF2) ∃E1 ∈ ECO(AF1): E1 ⊆ E2. The conclusion easily follows from
the fact that, as well known, for any AF GE(AF) ∈ ECO(AF) and ∀E ∈ ECO(AF) GE(AF) ⊆ E. Moreover, from
Proposition 60, we have that GE(AF1) ⊆ GE(AF2). Then ∀E2 ∈ ECO(AF2) ∃E1 = GE(AF1) ∈ ECO(AF1): E1 ⊆
GE(AF2) ⊆ E2. (cid:2)

Turning to stable semantics, it is easy to see that it satisﬁes (cid:19)E

W -skepticism adequacy in all cases where stable
extensions exist for both the argumentation frameworks considered in the comparison (otherwise, one (or both) of the
terms of comparison is undeﬁned and nothing can be said).

Proposition 62. Given two argumentation frameworks AF1 = (cid:3)A, →1(cid:5) ∈ DST and AF2 = (cid:3)A, →2(cid:5) ∈ DST such that
AF1 (cid:19)A AF2, EST (AF1) (cid:19)E
W

EST (AF2).

Proof. We have to show that ∀E2 ∈ EST (AF2) ∃E1 ∈ EST (AF1): E1 ⊆ E2. It is easy to prove in particular that
∀E2 ∈ EST (AF2) E2 ∈ EST (AF1). In fact, since CON F(AF1) = CON F (AF2) if E2 is conﬂict-free in AF2 it is also
so in AF1. Moreover, since →2 ⊆ →1, given that ∀α ∈ (A \ E2) E2 →2 α, then ∀α ∈ (A \ E2) E2 →1 α. Therefore
E2 is a stable extension of AF1. (cid:2)

Finally, also CF2 semantics satisﬁes (cid:19)E

W -skepticism adequacy. This follows from the (actually stronger) result in

Proposition 63, proved in [3].

Proposition 63. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and two arguments α, β ∈ A such that α (cid:15)= β ∧
α → β, ECF2(AF) ⊆ ECF2(AF(cid:2)(α,β)).

The remaining semantics fail to satisfy (cid:19)E

∩ -skepticism adequacy and therefore skepticism adequacy in any form.
Consider ﬁrst the example in Fig. 5. It can be seen that ES (AF1) = {∅} for preferred, ideal, semi-stable and preferred
prudent semantics. However, for the same semantics it holds that ES (AF2) = {(cid:6)}. Also stable prudent semantics fails
to satisfy (cid:19)E
∩ -skepticism adequacy, as shown by the example in Fig. 6. In fact AF1 admits exactly one stable prudent
extension, namely {α, δ}, while AF2 admits as unique stable prudent extension the set {α, γ }. As to grounded prudent
semantics, consider Fig. 7. It is easy to see that GPE(AF1) = {α, γ } (in particular ζ cannot be included as it indirectly
(cid:2)(α,β), we have GPE(AF2) = {γ , ζ }. As for complete
conﬂicts with α). On the other hand, considering AF2 = AF1
prudent semantics, consider Fig. 8: it turns out that ECOP (AF1) = {{α, γ2}, {γ2, γ5}}, while ECOP (AF2) = {{α}}.

6.5. Resolution adequacy

The criterion of resolution adequacy is satisﬁed in all forms by preferred3 and stable semantics. The proof con-

cerning preferred semantics requires a preliminary lemma.

Lemma 64. (See Lemma 1 of [18].) Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) and a set E ⊆ A, E ∈ AS(AF)
if and only if ∃ AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF): E ∈ AS(AF(cid:20)).

Proposition 65. For any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), UR(AF, PR) (cid:19)E
S

EPR(AF).

Proof. We have to prove the conditions: (i) ∀E2 ∈ EPR(AF) ∃E1 ∈ UR(AF, PR): E1 ⊆ E2; (ii) ∀E1 ∈
UR(AF, PR) ∃E2 ∈ EPR(AF): E1 ⊆ E2.

From Lemma 64 it follows in particular that for any maximal admissible set E2 (actually, a preferred extension) of
AF, there is AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) such that E2 is admissible in AF(cid:20). Then E2 is maximal admissible in AF(cid:20) (since there
cannot be an admissible set of AF(cid:20) which is not an admissible set of AF), and therefore E2 ∈ UR(AF, PR). Thus,
∀E2 ∈ EPR(AF) E2 ∈ UR(AF, PR), which proves condition (i). On the other hand, since any E1 ∈ UR(AF, PR)

3 Some results related to resolution adequacy of grounded, complete, and preferred semantics are provided in [18] and are generalized here.

is a (maximal) admissible set in an AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) we know from Lemma 64 that E1 is admissible in AF and is
therefore included in one of the maximal admissible sets of AF, which is exactly the desired condition (ii). (cid:2)

A similar result holds for stable extensions, provided that their existence in AF and in all elements of RES(AF) is

assumed.

Proposition 66. For any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), such that AF ∈ DST and ∀ AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) AF(cid:20) ∈
DST , UR(AF, ST ) (cid:19)E
S

EST (AF).

Proof. We actually prove the stronger result UR(AF, ST ) = EST (AF). UR(AF, ST ) ⊆ EST (AF) follows from the
fact that any stable extension of any AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) is also a stable extension of AF (see the proof of Proposition 62).
On the other hand, given S ∈ EST (AF), we have to show that there is at least an AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) such that S ∈
EST (AF(cid:20)). If no element of S is involved in a mutual attack, it is easy to see that ∀ AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) S ∈ EST (AF(cid:20)).
Otherwise, such an AF(cid:20) is obtained from AF by suppressing, for any mutual attack involving an argument α ∈ S, the
edge incoming into α (clearly there are no mutual attacks within S as it is conﬂict-free). (cid:2)

Semantics which are partially inspired by the notion of stable extension, namely semi-stable and stable prudent
semantics, are unable to satisfy (cid:19)E
S -resolution adequacy while complying with its weaker forms. As to negative
results, Fig. 9 shows that (cid:19)E
S -resolution adequacy does not hold for semi-stable semantics. In fact, E1 = {α} is the
only semi-stable extension of AF1 ∈ RES(AF) but there is no E2 among the semi-stable extensions of AF such that
E1 ⊆ E2, since the only semi-stable extension of AF is {β, δ}. As to stable prudent semantics, we can refer back to
Fig. 6. In fact, E1 = {α, δ} is a stable prudent extension of AF1 ∈ RES(AF2) but there is no E2 among the stable
prudent extensions of AF2 such that E1 ⊆ E2 (since the only stable prudent extension of AF2 is {α, γ }).

The following proposition shows that semi-stable semantics satisﬁes (cid:19)E

W -resolution adequacy.

Proposition 67. For any argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5), UR(AF, SST ) (cid:19)E
W

ESST (AF).

Proof. We have to prove that ∀E2 ∈ ESST (AF) ∃E1 ∈ UR(AF, SST ): E1 ⊆ E2. It is known that any semi-stable
extension of any AF is also a preferred extension of AF [9]. Then, given a semi-stable extension E2 ∈ ESST (AF), it
can be derived from the proof of Lemma 64 given in [18] that ∃ AF(cid:20) ∈ RES(AF) such that E2 is a preferred extension
of AF(cid:20) and outchildAF(E2) = outchildAF(cid:20)(E2). Suppose by contradiction that E2 is not also a semi-stable extension
of AF(cid:20), then there is a maximal admissible set S in AF(cid:20) such that (S ∪ outchildAF(cid:20)(S)) (cid:4) (E2 ∪ outchildAF(cid:20)(E2)).
Recall that outchildAF(cid:20)(S) ⊆ outchildAF(S), and that S is admissible also in AF. Then there is a maximal admissi-
ble set S∗ ∈ AF such that S∗ ⊇ S and therefore outchildAF(S∗) ⊇ outchildAF(S) ⊇ outchildAF(cid:20)(S). But then (S∗ ∪
outchildAF(S∗)) ⊇ (S ∪ outchildAF(S)) ⊇ (S ∪ outchildAF(cid:20)(S)) (cid:4) (E2 ∪ outchildAF(cid:20)(E2)) = (E2 ∪ outchildAF(E2)),
thus (S∗ ∪ outchildAF(S∗)) (cid:4) (E2 ∪ outchildAF(E2)) which contradicts the fact that E2 is a semi-stable extension of
AF. (cid:2)

Finally, also stable prudent semantics satisﬁes (cid:19)E

W -resolution adequacy (proof is omitted).

AF(cid:20)∈RES(AF) GPE(AF(cid:20))) ⊆ GPE(AF).

The remaining semantics fail to satisfy resolution adequacy in any form. To see this for grounded, ideal
and complete semantics consider again Fig. 10. First, it is easy to see that UR(AF, GR) = UR(AF, ID) =
UR(AF, CO) = {{α, δ}, {β, δ}}. Then, note that EGR(AF) = EID(AF) = {GE(AF)} = {ID(AF)} = {∅} while
ECO(AF) = {∅, {α, δ}, {β, δ}}. As a consequence, for any S ∈ {GR, ID, CO} it holds that UR(AF, S) (cid:5)E
∩ ES (AF),
E2∈ES (AF) E2. Therefore UR(AF, S) (cid:5)E ES (AF) for any skepticism relation
since
(cid:19)E.

(cid:11)

As for CF2 semantics, consider Fig. 11 where RES(AF) = {AF1, AF2}. First, it is easy to see that {α, β3, β5, γ } ∈
E∈ECF2(AF) E. Then it can be noted that ECF2(AF1) = {α, β2, β4, β6, δ}, while

ECF2(AF) therefore, in particular, δ /∈

(cid:11)

(cid:6)

(cid:7)

Thus δ ∈

E∈UR(AF,CF2) E and as a consequence UR(AF, CF2) (cid:5)E

∩ ECF2(AF).

Finally, the example of Fig. 12 rules out preferred prudent and complete prudent semantics. In fact the sets of
preferred prudent and complete prudent extensions of AF include {α, γ } and {δ}. Given RES(AF) = {AF1, AF2}, we
note that there is a unique preferred prudent (and complete prudent) extension of AF1, namely {α, δ}, and a unique
preferred prudent (and complete prudent) extension of AF2, namely {α, γ }. Then the intersection of the extensions of
the argumentation frameworks in RES(AF), namely {α}, is not included in the intersection of the extensions of AF,
which is the empty set.

7. Discussion and conclusions

We have provided several general criteria for principle-based evaluation of extension-based argumentation seman-
tics and applied them to a signiﬁcant range of both “traditional” and more recent approaches. As to our knowledge,
in the literature there are no other examples of such a systematic and extensive assessment of existing semantics pro-
posals. In fact, example-based and/or pairwise comparisons are most commonly found, as discussed in Section 1. It
has to be remarked, however, that the issue of formulating general principles for argumentation semantics is receiving
an increasing attention in very recent years. Caminada and Amgoud [11] have discussed the issue of deﬁning general
rationality postulates for argumentation. In particular, the postulates of closeness under strict rules and consistency of
extensions have been introduced, showing that there are argumentation systems where they are violated. Since these
postulates are deﬁned at the level of the language where arguments are explicitly constructed while our analysis lies
at a more abstract level, this kind of work, while sharing the same spirit, represents a complementary and possibly
synergic research line with respect to ours.

At a more speciﬁc level, relationships with some of the criteria we have introduced can be found in the literature.
Defense related properties, namely admissibility and reinstatement, have often been used to compare argumentation
semantics, at least at an informal level. We have provided a systematic formal characterization of these notions,
including stronger and weaker versions, which, as to our knowledge, have not been considered before in the literature.
In a similar line, Caminada has recently tackled the issue of providing postulates for the notion of reinstatement in

P. Baroni, M. Giacomin / Artiﬁcial Intelligence 171 (2007) 675–700

the context of labellings of argumentation frameworks [10]. It turns out that the basic postulates on labeling provide
an equivalent characterization of complete extensions, while adding other minimality/maximality requirements one
may obtain a characterization of other Dung’s semantics. While in the present paper we are dealing with extension-
based rather than labeling-based argumentation semantics, extending the deﬁnition of the criteria we propose to the
case of labeling-based semantics represents an interesting issue for future work. As to the directionality property, the
related criterion of relevance has been proposed in [9] when discussing the differences between stable and semi-stable
semantics. Given an argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, →(cid:5) an argument α is relevant with respect to β if and only
if there is an undirected path from α to β in AF. Actually relevance is an equivalence relation, whose classes coincide
with the partition of the (undirected) defeat graph into its connected components. A semantics satisﬁes the relevance
criterion if the state of an argument is not affected by the presence of irrelevant arguments. Relevance can be regarded
as a weaker form of the directionality criterion where only the existence but not the direction of attack relations is taken
into account. As to adequacy criteria, starting from an analysis of hierarchical argumentation frameworks Modgil [18]
has proposed, as already mentioned in Section 4.4, a general requirement for argumentation semantics, based on the
notion of resolution of an argumentation framework and expressed as an if-and-only-if condition. We have shown that
one of the directions of the condition is a special case of the criterion of skepticism adequacy, previously proposed
in [3] and extended here, while we have generalized the other direction of the condition introducing the criterion of
resolution adequacy.

From the application of evaluation criteria it has emerged that, with different degrees, every literature semantics
violates some of the proposed criteria. Not all these violations are undesirable by themselves. For instance, some of
them may be ascribed to the fact that some criteria are not strictly required (as in the case of I-maximality) or are too
demanding (as in the case of strong admissibility). Other violations derive from deliberate design choices in order to
achieve some desired behavior: this is the case, for instance, of CF2 semantics where admissibility and reinstatement
are given up to achieve a “symmetric” treatment of odd- and even-length cycles. Grounded semantics is the closest
to the goal of satisfying all the criteria, as it only violates the criterion of resolution adequacy in its various forms.
At a general level, the situation sketched above stresses the problem of identifying which criteria are more suitable
for different application domains and/or reasoning styles. A recent example of this kind of investigation is provided
by the analysis carried out in [21] where it is suggested that in certain contexts epistemic reasoning is skeptical while
practical reasoning is credulous. At a more technical level, one may raise the question whether the proposed criteria
are incompatible altogether. Answering this question will be the subject of future work.
