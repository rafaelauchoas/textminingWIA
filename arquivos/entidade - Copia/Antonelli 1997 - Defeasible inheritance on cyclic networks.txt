Abstract 

In  this  paper,  we  are  going  to  present  a  new  notion  of  “extension”  for  defeasible  inheritance 
networks  that  allows  us  to  deal  with  cyclic  nets.  Horty  has  shown  that  cyclic  nets  need  not 
have  extensions 
in  the  sense  of  Touretzky.  This  paper  presents  a  generalization  of  that  notion 
of  extension  that  can  be  applied  to  cyclic  nets.  The  present  proposal  is  inspired  by  a  somewhat 
unexpected  analogy  between  cyclic  nets  and  “semantically  closed”  languages,  i.e.,  languages 
containing  their  own  truth  predicate.  Accordingly,  this  approach  to defeasible  inheritance  networks 
with  cycles  shows  similarities  to  the  solution  of  semantic  paradoxes  put  forth  by  Kripke.  @  1997
