Abstract 

Shortcomings  of  qualitative  simulation  and  of quantitative  simulation  motivate  combining  them 
to  do  simulations  exhibiting  strengths  of  both.  The  resulting  class  of  techniques  is  called  semi- 
quantitative  simulation.  One  approach  to  semi-quantitative  simulation  is to use  numeric  intervals  to 
represent  incomplete  quantitative  information.  In  this  research  we  demonstrate  semi-quantitative 
simulation  using  intervals  in  an  implemented  semi-quantitative  simulator  called  Q3.  Q3  pro- 
gressively  refines  a  qualitative  simulation,  providing  increasingly  specific  quantitative  predictions 
which  can  converge  to  a  numerical  simulation  in  the  limit  while  retaining  important  correctness 
guarantees  from  qualitative  and  interval  simulation  techniques. 

Q3’s  simulations  are based  on  a technique  we call  step  size  re$nement.  While  a pure  qualitative 
simulation  has  a  very  coarse  step  size,  representing  the  state  of  a  system  trajectory  at  relatively 
few  qualitatively  distinct  states,  Q3  interpolates  newly  explicit  states  between  distinct  qualitative 
states,  thereby  representing  more  states  which  instantiate  new  constraints,  leading  to  improved 
quantitative  inferences. 

93’s  techniques  have  been  used  for  prediction,  measurement  interpretation,  diagnosis,  and  even 
analysis  of  the  probabilities  of  qualitative  behaviors.  Because  Q3  shares  important  expressive  and 
inferential  properties  of  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  simulation,  43  helps  to  bridge  the  gap 
between  qualitative  and  quantitative  simulation.  @  1997 Elsevier  Science  B.V.

Higher-order 

systems 
The  proof  of  Lemma  B. 1 extends 

to  higher-order 

systems  as  follows.  First,  we  describe 

the  higher-order 

system  as  a  system  of  first-order  equations 

[ 46,  Section  3.21.  *’ 

Each  individual 

equation  Fi  in  the  system  F  may  be  a  function  of  several  variables 
and  interval  valued  constants  Y(j),  each  a  component  of  vector  Y.  We  must  push  through 
the  proof  of  Lemma  B.l  for  Y  and  F  in  place  of  Y and  F. 

Steps  ( 1)  and  (2)  of  the  proof  of  Lemma  B. 1  now  involve  a  mean  value  constraint 

to  be  reached.  Termination  was  discussed 

for  each  component  Fi  of  vector  F.  The  algorithm  now  needs

to  F  because

a  vector  as  the  width  of  its  widest  component 

in  Section  4.3.2.  Step  (3)  generalizes 
to  each  component  Fi.  Step  (4)  uses  interval  widths,  which 
the  norm  of 
[66]  proves  his 

to  vectors  of  intervals.  Norms  may  be  used  instead,  defining 

to  terminate 

for  a  fixed 

interval.  Since  Moore
