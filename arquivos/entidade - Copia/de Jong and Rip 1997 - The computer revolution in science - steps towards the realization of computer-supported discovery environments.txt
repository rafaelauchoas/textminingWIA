Abstract 

The  tools  that  scientists  use  in  their  search  processes  together  form  so-called  discovery  environ- 
ments.  The  promise  of artificial  intelligence  and  other  branches  of  computer  science  is  to radically 
transform  conventional  discovery  environments  by  equipping  scientists  with  a  range  of  powerful 
computer  tools  including 
large-scale,  shared  knowledge  bases  and  discovery  programs.  We  will 
describe  the  future  computer-supported  discovery  environments  that  may  result,  and  illustrate  by 
means  of  a  realistic  scenario  how  scientists  come  to  new  discoveries  in  these  environments.  In 
order  to  make  the  step  from  the  current  generation  of  discovery  tools  to  computer-supported 
discovery  environments 
like  the  one  presented  in  the  scenario,  developers  should  realize  that 
such  environments  are  large-scale  sociotechnical  systems.  They  should  not  just  focus  on  isolated 
computer  programs,  but  also  pay  attention  to  the  question  how  these  programs  will  be  used  and 
maintained  by  scientists  in  research  practices.  In  order  to  help  developers  of  discovery  programs 
in  achieving  the  integration  of  their  tools  in  discovery  environments,  we  will  formulate  a  set  of 
guidelines  that  developers  could  follow.  @  1997 Elsevier  Science  B.V.

Fig.  4.  Model  of  the  repressor  process.  The  model  consists  of  a  number  of  conclusions  of  reasoning  steps

the  transcriptional  activity decreases,  leading  to a  lower  mRNA concentration.  Through 
the  translation  and  synthesis processes  this  eventually  results  in  a  lower  concentration 
of  trp  in  the  cell.  Thus,  one  could  conclude,  the  regulation  process  described  in  the 
model  is  essentially  a  negative  feedback  system:  the  production  of  ttp  varies  inversely 
with the  trp  concentration  in  the  cell. 

Noyafsky  directed  his  mouse  to  the  transcription  process  in  the  qualitative  regula- 
tion  model  (Fig.  3).  A  click,  and  a  schematic  structure  summarizing  the  steps  in  the 
transcription  process  from  DNA  to  mRNA appeared  on  the  screen  (Fig.  5).  The  model 
of  the  transcription  process  showed  how  RNA polymerase  transcribed  the  genes  of  the 
operon,  including  the  trpL  gene  for  which  no  biological  function  was  known,  into  an 
mRNA strand.  Nothing  is wrong  with this, Noyafsky thought. It did  not relieve  his gloomy 
mood. 

It  would  be  possible  to  extend  the  model  with  details  on  RNA  polymerase  and 
the  biochemical  reactions  of  the  transcription  process.  It  was  easy  to  accomplish, 
but  he  knew  that  once  he  would  start  to  wander  through  the  network,  it  would  be 
seductive  to  delve  into  the  mass  of  available  data.  In  the  beginning  he  would  con- 
centrate  and  focus  on  information  that  could  be  helpful  in  his  research,  but  gradu- 
ally  his  curiosity  would  lead  him  to  completely  diferent  topics.  Last  week  he  ended 
with  the  pyramid  of  Cheops  and  the  other  day  he  had  watched,  fascinated,  a  three- 
dimensional  simulation  of  a  rocket  launch.  Tonight  he  did  not  want  to  work  late 
and  risk  a  quarrel  at  home.  Besides,  the  e-mail  message  or  telephone  call  from 
Pierre  announcing  that  the  results  were  available  on  the  ftp  site  of  the  CRBM  lab 
in  Paris  clearly  would  not  arrive  today.  He  stored  the  models  obtained  from  Denver, 
intending  to  use  the  local  copies  for  the  daily  group  meeting  tomorrow,  and  went 
home.

the frequency  of  the formation  of  repressor-operator  complexes  would not  change.  As  a 
consequence,  the  system  concluded  after  making  a fao  additional  reasoning  steps,  the 
concentration  trp-mRNA  should  remain  unchanged  (Fig.  3).  The  qualitative  reasoning 
module  had  established  an  inconsistency  between  the  observations  in  Paris  and  the 
accepted  regulation  model. 

Now the  thing  was to act  swiftly and  stay ahead  of  their  competitors.  It was important 
to  come  up  with at  least  a preliminary  answer  before  the  Paris  results  would find  their 
way into  the  Regulation  Process  Database.  The  computer  programs  at  other  institutes, 
continuously  interpreting  new  laboratory Jindings  and  comparing  them  with the  library 
of  regulation  models  in Denver,  would not  need  much  time  to identify the  inconsistency. 
The  striking  findings  would  immediately  stir  rival  research  groups  into  action.  Bruce 
Noyafsky looked  round  the  circle  of  colleagues:  Who had  a  good  idea? 

Neil  Sandor$  a  biochemist,  responded  first:  “I  think  the  problem  should  be  located 
somewhere  in  the  transcription  process.  The  transcription  process  seems  to  react  to 
a  change  of  trp  concentration  in  a  special  way,  difSerently from  the  usual  repressor 
mechanism.  But  how?  I  don’t  know  . . .“,  The  computer  librarian  Liza  Bernstein  broke 
the  silence.  “Why  don’t  we  have  a  look  at  what  QualChem  has  to  say?”  QualChem 
was a program  which  generated  hypotheses  on  the basis  of  qualitative chemical  models. 
Other  groups  had  intimated  it could  come  up  with interesting  suggestions,  but Noyafsky 
and  his  group  had  never  used  it. Recently,  the program  was made  available  to members 
of  the  American  Chemical  Society,  in  a  special  program  base.  It  remained  to  be  seen 
whether  QualChem  was compatible  with the way in which qualitative chemical  processes 
were  represented  in  the  GRP  knowledge  base,  but  Liza  would  not  need  much  time  to 
find  out.  The  others  decided  to  use  the  graphical  process  simulator  in  the  meantime,  in 
order  to  check  the  transcription  process  of  the  trp  operon  once  again. 

The  graphical  process  simulator  made  use  of  the  underlying  knowledge  structure  to 
visualize  the  sequence  of  steps  in  the  transcription  process.  Symbols  representing  RNA 
polymerases  slid  over  an  abstract  DNA  strand  dragging  behind  them a  steadily growing 
tail  of  mRNA.  Bruce  Noyafsky  saw  how  ribosomes  translated  the  mRNA  molecule  into 
a  number  of  enzymes  which  catalyzed  the  chemical  reactions  producing  trp.  While  he 
looked  at  the  RNA polymerases  moving  in succession  on  the  screen,  he  wondered  briejy 
about  the  strange  fact  that the  first  gene,  trpL,  did  not  make  any  direct  contribution  to 
the synthesis of  trp.  Its function  was unknown. He  did  not have  time to reject  on  this, for 
Liza  turned  away from  the  workstation to tell them  that QualChem  was compatible  with 
the  regulation  model.  The  graphical  process  simulator  was  interrupted  and  the  group 
waited  to  see  what  QualChem  would  make  of  the  regulation  model  and  the  conflicting 
data. 

QualChem  consisted  of  a  structured  set  of  hypothesis  operators  which  could  change 
parts  of  the  qualitative  model.  A  qualitative  model  was  viewed  as  a  constellation  of 
interacting  processes,  each  composed  of  individual  reasoning  steps  or  subprocesses. 
The  hypothesis  operators  could  change  conditions  of processes,  postulate  new processes, 
modify  effects  of processes,  dispute  the  connection  between  subprocesses,  and  adapt  the 
initial conditions  of  models.  The  hypothesis  operators  were  domain  independent,  but  the 
user  had  the  opportunity  to  indicate  in  which  specialized  knowledge  bases  background 
knowledge  could  be  found.  QualChem  could  thus  generate  relevant  hypotheses  for  a
