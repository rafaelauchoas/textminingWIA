Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  paper 

is  to  study 

the  fundamental  mechanism, 

humans  use  in 

argumentation, 

and  to  explore  ways  to  implement 

this  mechanism  on  computers. 

We  do  so  by  first  developing 

a  theory  for  argumentation  whose  central  notion

The  relations  between  preferred  extensions,  grounded  extensions  and  complete

is  given  in  the  following  theorem. 

Theorem  25. 

(1)  Each  preferred  extension  is  a  complete  extension,  but  not  vice  versa. 
(2)  The  grounded  extension  is  the  least  (with  respect  to  set  inclusion)  complete

(3)  The  complete  extensions  form  a  complete  semilattice’  with  respect  to  set

(1)  It  is  obvious  from  the  fixpoint  definition  of  complete  extensions 

that 
Proof. 
every  preferred  extension 
is  a  complete  extension.  The  Nixon  diamond  example 
provides  a  counter  example  that  the  reverse  does  not  hold  since  the  empty  set  is a 
complete  extension  but  not  a  preferred  one.

(3)  Let  SE  be  a  nonempty 

set  of  complete  extensions.  Let 

LB  = {E  1 E  is  admissible  and  EC  E’  for  each  E’  in  SE} 

It  is clear  that  GE  E  LB.  So  LB  is not  empty.  Let  S =  U {E 1 E  E  LB}. 
It  is clear 
that  S  is  admissible, 
it  is 
clear  that  E  is  a  complete  extension  and  E  E  LB.  Thus  E  = S.  So  E  is  the  glb  of

4.3.3.  Coincidence  between  different  semantics 

for  practical  purposes 

Due  to  the  fact  that  a  logic  program  can  have  different  semantics, 

it  is  often 
important 
to  find  sufficient  syntactical  conditions  guarantee- 
ing  the  existence  and  the  equivalence  of  these  semantics.  In  this  section,  we  want 
to  show  that  all  the  conditions  which  have  been  given  in  the  logic  programming 
literature 
our  newly 
gumentation 

the  equivalence  of  different  semantics  can  be  captured  by 
of  ar- 
notions  of  well-foundedness 

to  guarantee 
introduced 

and  uncontroversity 

frameworks. 

Let  Pred  be  the  set  of  all  predicate  symbols  occurring 

in  a  logic  program  P.  The 
predicate  dependency  graph  [2]  of  P  is  a  directed  graph  with  signed  edges.  The 
nodes  are  the  elements  of  Pred.  An  edge  from  p  to  q  is  positive 
(respectively 
iff  p  occurs  in  the  head  of  a  clause  C  of  P  and  q  occurs  in  a  positive 
negative) 
literal  in  the  body  of  C.  Define  a+  1 and  2  _ 1 by  p  S+  1 q 
(respectively  negative) 
(respectively  p  a_,  q)  iff  there 
is  a  (nonempty)  path  from  p  to  q  containing  an 
even  (respectively  odd)  number  of  negative  edges  in  the  predicate  dependency 
graph.Further,letusdefinep~qiffp~+,qorp~_,q,andp~qiffp~qand 
4  >P. 

A  program 

is said  to  be  hierarchical 

is said 
[37]  if  there  is no  p  ap.  A  program 
is  strict 
to  be  stratified  [2]  if  we  never  have  both  p  =  q  and  p  a_,  q.  A  program 
[35,  541  if  there  are  no  p  and  q  such  that  p  a+  1 q  and  p  ==_1 q.  A  program 
is 
call-consistent  [12,  18,  35,  541 if  there  is no  predicate  symbol  p  such  that  p  z=_1 p. 

It  is  not  difficult  to  see  that  the  following 

theorems  hold: 

Theorem  57. 

(1)  Zf  P  is  stratified,  then  AF,,,,,(P) 
(2)  Zf  P  is  hierarchical, 

then  AF,,,,(P) 

is  well-founded. 

is  well-founded. 

Theorem  58. 

(1)  Zf  P  is  strict,  then  both  AF,,,,,(P) 
(2)  Zf  P  is  call-consistent, 

and  AF,,,,(P) 

are  uncontroversial. 

then  both  AF,,,,,,(P) 

and  AF,,,,,(P) 

are 

limited 

controversial. 

Therefore,  we  immediately  obtain  the  following  results. 

Corollary  59. 

(1)  The  stable  and  well-founded  semantics  of  stratified  logic  programs  coincide. 
(2)  Clark’s  completion  of  a  hierarchical  program  P  has  exactly  one  Herbrand 

model  which  coincides  with  Fitting’s  model  of  P.

(3)  Each  maximal  three-valued  Herbrand  model  of  camp(P)
