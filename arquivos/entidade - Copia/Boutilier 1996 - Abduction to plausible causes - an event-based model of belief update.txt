Abstract 

The  Katsuno  and  Mendelzon  (KM)  theory  of  belief  update  has  been  proposed  as  a  reasonable 
model  for  revising  beliefs  about  a  changing  world.  However,  the  semantics  of  update  relies  on 
information  which  is  not  readily  available.  We describe  an  alternative  semantical  view  of update  in 
which  observations  are  incorporated  into  a  belief  set  by:  (a)  explaining  the  observation  in  terms 
of  a  set  of  plausible  events  that  might  have  caused  that  observation;  and  (b)  predicting  further 
consequences  of  those  explanations.  We  also  allow  the  possibility  of  conditional  expluna~ions. 
We  show  that  this  picture  naturally  induces  an  update  operator  conforming  to  the  KM  postulates 
under  certain  assumptions.  However,  we  argue  that  these  assumptions  are  not  always  reasonable, 
and  they  restrict  our  ability  to  integrate  update  with  other  forms  of  revision  when  reasoning  about 
action.

This  leads  to  a  very  different  view  of  update.  When  confronted  with  an  observation  or 
update  0,  an  agent  seeks  an  explanation  of  0,  in  terms  of  some  external  event  that  would
