The objective was to understand the lived experience of medical students of Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil, in the Mentoring Program. A documentary research was performed with phenomenological analysis of the students' reports at the end of the Mentoring Program. The elements of the experience in the reports present three thematic groups: 1 The context of Mentoring, 2 The experience of Mentoring, 3 The experience's evaluation. The Mentoring relationship contributed both in facing the vicissitudes of training and in the exercise of skills such as listening, acceptance and communication, fundamental skills contributing to the good performance of the medical professionals in their daily life. The experience of mentoring students showed intersections between the support for students and the demands of training in humanistic areas in medical education.",

The wax models, representing diseases or body parts that were the subject of medical forensic investigation, were produced by Augusto Esteves between 1936 and 1960. It is believed that the ceroplastic production represented the program devised by Flamínio Fávero, full professor of forensic medicine between 1923 and 1955. The comparison between the wax pieces at Museu Técnico-Científico (a science and technology museum) at Instituto Oscar Freire and the treatise on forensic medicine by Fávero, first published in 1938, indicates that such a supposition is plausible.",

This study is to evaluate access to health, comparing health indicators before and after the Program. We collected data from DATASUS, SIAB, and the Ministry of Health. There was a marked increase in the number of appointments for infants under one year of age, adults, the elderly, STD/HIV patients and group patient care. There was a decrease in appointments outside the catchment area, as well as hospital admissions for other causes, mothers exclusively breastfeeding their infants up to four months. We concluded that after deployment of the Program, there was an increase in health access and health promotion focused on an area that presents an enormous challenge for Primary Health Care (PHC). It would seem that, since this is a high vulnerability area with a large area for care, hospital admissions for PHC care-sensitive conditions, as well as referrals for secondary services, did not decrease.",

Novel strategies targeting at regenerating the injured myocardium have been investigated, including gene therapy, cell therapy, and the use of growth factors. Growth factor therapy has aroused interest in cardiovascular medicine because of the regeneration mechanisms induced by these biomolecules, including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, cardiomyocyte proliferation, stem-cell recruitment, and others. Together, these mechanisms promote myocardial repair and improvement of the cardiac function. This review aims to address the strategic role of growth factor therapy in cardiac regeneration, considering its innovative and multifactorial character in myocardial repair after ischemic injury. Different issues will be discussed, with emphasis on the regeneration mechanisms as a potential therapeutic resource mediated by growth factors, and the challenges to make these proteins therapeutically viable in the field of cardiology and regenerative medicine.",

In the first experiment the treatments were a) median cutting with a bud and without leaves, b) with a bud and two leaves, c) with two buds and without leaves and d) with two buds and two leaves. In the second experiment we evaluated apical, median and basal cuttings combined with leaves and without leaves. We evaluated length and number of roots, number of leaves, dry matter of roots, rooting and survival. The cuttings with two buds and two leaves had higher root length (10.5 cm), number of roots (18.5), number of leaves (6.6), dry mass of roots (0.48 mg), percentage of rooting (90\%) and survival (100\%). The basal cuttings with leaves had higher root length (10.5 cm), number of roots (18.5) and leaves (6.6), the highest percentage of rooting (96.8\%) and survival (100\%). Cuttings with one bud and apical cuttings have a lower survival rate, around 70\%. For the T. subulata propagation we recommend the use of basal cuttings with two leaves.",

The aim of this research was to gauge how medical students view educational feedback, and to identify the positive and negative characteristics of both teachers and students involved with the completion of feedback. Qualitative in nature, the study collected data via focus groups of fourth-year or eighth-term students at three medical schools. Thematic analyses revealed four major themes: the characteristics of feedback received, factors related to the occurrence of feedback, characteristics of the teacher to have provided feedback, and characteristics of the student to have received feedback. Regardless of the institution and the curriculum model, this sample suggested that the practice of feedback needs to be improved in the teaching and learning environments. Teachers should be encouraged to provide feedback and students should seek it out, so that it becomes a regular, continuous, and quality practice.",

There was no correlation between the prevalence of DP/DR and individual factors such as age, gender or income. Conclusion We observed a high prevalence of DP/DR disorder among medical students, which may adversely affect their personal and professional life, causing significant distress. It is possible that students in lower years are at a greater risk of developing the disorder, and that mechanisms developed by students used to face stress may play a key role in their susceptibility to this and other psychological disorders.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: To identify the profile of women seen in a Fetal Medicine unit, diagnosed with fetal abnormality incompatible with neonatal survival in their current pregnancy, and to check the association of gestational age upon diagnosis with the option of pregnancy termination. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study carried out in the Fetal Medicine Outpatients Clinic of a university hospital, in the city of São Paulo (SP), Brazil, using medical records of pregnant women with fetus presenting abnormalities incompatible with neonatal survival. The sample comprised 94 medical records. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 19, was used for the data statistical analysis. Results: The population of the study included young adult women, who had complete or incomplete high school education, employed, with family income of one to three minimum wages, single, nonsmokers, who did not drink alcoholic beverages or used illicit drugs. Women with more advanced gestational age upon fetal diagnosis (p=0.0066) and/or upon admission to the specialized unit (p=0.0018) presented a lower percentage of termination of pregnancy. Conclusion: Due to characteristics different from those classically considered as of high gestational risk, these women might not be easily identified during the classification of gestational risk, what may contribute to a late diagnosis of fetal diseases. Early diagnosis enables access to specialized multiprofessional care in the proper time for couple's counseling on the possibility of requesting legal authorization for pregnancy termination.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective The aim was to evaluate empathy and facial expression recognition of basic and complex emotions and their correlations in medical students. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in a medical school of the state of São Paulo. We evaluated 86 third and fourth year medical students with the following instruments: (i) Jefferson Scale of Empathy, (ii) Facial Expression Recognition of basic emotions task (REF) and (iii) Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMEt). Results The overall mean score in the REF was 15.6 (SD: ±2.3). There was a statistical significant difference in the number of correct responses in sadness emotion in female gender compared to male (t84 = 2.30; p = 0.02). Regarding RMEt, the overall mean score was 26.5 (SD: ±3.3) with statistically significant difference between genders with higher number of correct responses among female students (t84 = 3.43; p < 0.01). The mean score on the empathy scale was 121.3 (SD: ±9.8). There was significant weak positive correlation between the total score of empathy scale and the recognition of sadness facial emotion (r = 0.29; p < 0.01). Conclusion The number of correct responses to sadness emotion in the REF and the total score of RMEt was higher in female students compared to male. In addition, empathy seems to be directly related to the ability to recognize sadness. Other studies are needed to provide a deeper understanding of empathy and facial emotion recognition in medical students.",

We place our research in a genealogical perspective, analyzing the composition and loss of sense of reformist territories in Italian and Brazilian scenarios. We discussed the images to express the collective health - the people, the group and civil society - to propose a different way of thinking that expression, of procedural and intensive character as a power. It is not the setting of this notion to assigned shapes that makes Collective Health, but the strength that characterizes the collective as something unspecific, power variation. Considering the uniqueness of the collective prevents that paradoxically, one reproduces a policy that affirms the precepts of Social Medicine or Public Health in the field of Collective Health, opening up the possibility for new productions of meaning.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Ochratoxin A is the second largest group of mycotoxins. It is a secondary metabolite produced mainly by fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, and has toxic and nephrotoxic properties that are associated with the Balkan endemic nephropathy and urinary tract tumors. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies it as group 2B: possibly carcinogenic to humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ochratoxin A (OTA) on the performance of the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaues vannamei). The experiment simulated the productive management of a shrimp farm located on the marine coast of Luis Correia, Piauí State. Five treatments with different levels of mycotoxins were used: T1- 100µg/kg of OTA; T2- 500µg/kg of OTA; T3 - 1000µg/kg of OTA; T4- 100µg/kg of OTA and 500μg/kg afatoxina B1 and T5 - 0.0µg/kg of OTA. OTA was produced by fermenting corn, using the Aspergillus ochraceus strain. Commercial feeds were contaminated with the corn kernels. OTA in the kernels, commercial feeds and shrimp tissues (cephalothorax and abdomen) were detected and quantified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To simulate the farming system, totaling 20 animals per box. The animals were fed twice a day and raised under these conditions for eight weeks. The shrimp gained weight during the weeks of the test, when subjected to different OTA treatments. The lowest weight gain was observed in T2 and T4 and the highest weight gains were in T1 and T5, which also presented the best feed conversion ratio. After 56 days, residual OTA was detected in samples of shrimp abdomen only in T1. Therefore, the productive performance of shrimp that are fed with OTA-contaminated feed is compromised, which has a negative economic impact on the shrimp industry, and is a health risk to consumers due to residues in the muscles.",

 abstract = "Abstract Objective: To generate physical models of fetuses from images obtained with three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and, occasionally, computed tomography (CT), in order to guide additive manufacturing technology. Materials and Methods: We used 3D-US images of 31 pregnant women, including 5 who were carrying twins. If abnormalities were detected by 3D-US, both MRI and in some cases CT scans were then immediately performed. The images were then exported to a workstation in DICOM format. A single observer performed slice-by-slice manual segmentation using a digital high resolution screen. Virtual 3D models were obtained from software that converts medical images into numerical models. Those models were then generated in physical form through the use of additive manufacturing techniques. Results: Physical models based upon 3D-US, MRI, and CT images were successfully generated. The postnatal appearance of either the aborted fetus or the neonate closely resembled the physical models, particularly in cases of malformations. Conclusion: The combined use of 3D-US, MRI, and CT could help improve our understanding of fetal anatomy. These three screening modalities can be used for educational purposes and as tools to enable parents to visualize their unborn baby. The images can be segmented and then applied, separately or jointly, in order to construct virtual and physical 3D models.",

Moreover, the physical restraint may generate intense stress, especially in animals of the feline species, which may also interfere with the results. This study aimed to evaluate examinations of clinical biochemistry in the use of physical restraint and chemistry in cats subjected to two sedation protocols. We used 50 cats, 26 females and 24 males, of mixed-breed, who underwent physical restraint and immediately after underwent two sedation protocols, DB (dexmedetomidine 5μg / kg and 0.3mg butorphanol / kg) and DBC (dexmedetomidine 5μg / kg butorphanol 0.3mg / kg ketamine and 3mg / kg), applied intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken after physical restraint and then after the use of one of the sedation protocols. The following parameters were evaluated: urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total serum protein (TP), albumin, globulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, magnesium and chloride in serum samples, and lactate and glucose in fluoride plasma samples. Statistical difference was found between groups for albumin, triglycerides, TP and cholesterol with higher values being found in the DBC group. A statistical difference between moments was found for cholesterol, and ALP with higher values in physical restraint only in the DBC group. Glucose had greater values after sedation for both groups. The study revealed that the use of these protocols implies restrictions on some biochemical parameters studied here, and that their interpretations should be evaluated carefully.",

It has been called low-volume and high speed disc herniation or disc explosions, and usually is associated with an intense exercise or traumatic episode. This report aims to present a case of an acute extrusion of nucleus pulposus with no compression of the spinal cord. A 3.5 year-old male dog of the Maltes breed, weighing 4.1kg was presented at the Veterinary Hospital with locomotion disorders and pain during manipulation with no history of trauma. At the physical and neurological examination, non-ambulatory paraparesis of acute onset with absence of proprioception and superficial pain in hind limbs was found, as well as pain on palpation of epaxial thoracolumbar spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive hyper intense area in the thoracolumbar spinal cord, with no signs of spinal cord compression, and decreased intensity of the nucleus pulposus of the L1-L2 intervertebral disc. Additionally, a spinal cord edema in all thoracolumbar segments was seen that is characteristic of an acute extrusion of non-compressive nucleus pulposus. A presumptive diagnosis of non-compressive myelopathy was assumed. The dog was prescribed steroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic, absolute rest and rehabilitation protocol, including acupuncture and physiotherapy. The patient recovered superficial pain in the pelvic limbs and evolved into ambulatory paraparesis after seven days. The results of this report suggested that MRI can be useful for making a presumptive diagnosis in dogs with a history of compatible clinical signs. Moreover, the conservative treatment in non-compressive disc extrusions can be feasible.",

Refrigerated raw milk samples were collected from expansion tanks for individual use of farms located in the middle region of the state of Goiás, and stored at four different temperatures (3°C, 11°C, 17°C, and 25°C) for 16 days. Total bacterial count (TBC), somatic cell count (SCC), and chemical composition were performed daily. The results were submitted to analysis of variance in split plot design in randomized blocks, and the means were compared by Duncan test. We concluded that, when azidiol is added as preservative to samples for TBC, they can be analyzed up to 16 days after collection when stored at temperatures of 3°C and 11°C, and up to 10 days when stored at 17°C. Moreover, when bronopol is added as preservative, samples for SCC and chemical composition analysis can be stored for up to 16 days after collection when stored at temperatures of 3°C and 11°C, and for up to seven days when stored at 17°C.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The biological fixatives have an important role in the final histology quality. In veterinary, routine skin biopsy is a common procedure and the choice of fixative is essential for the final result. The most common fixative is Formalin, even though it is toxic, carcinogenic, and has low and slow penetration. Still, there isn't a fixer which can replace the qualities of formalin. The aim of this study was to evaluate qualitatively the preservation of the histological features of dog skin using different tissue fixative embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin - eosin. We used a 4 mm punch pen to collect ear skin samples in six dog cadavers. After collection, the tissues were fixed in: (1) Bouin for 6 hours; (2) Carnoy for 4 hours; (3) 10\% buffered formaldehyde for 24 hours, all under refrigeration (4 ° C). The tissues were then processed, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The slides were evaluated blindly by four different pathologists who considered the qualitative aspects below: (1) quality of coloring; (2) preservation of the histological characteristics; (3) preservation of cytoplasmic boundaries using a Likert scale score for each blade. The fixative with the highest mean score on all items was buffered formalin with 3.76 points followed by Bouin (3.39) and Carnoy (2.52). Formaldehyde can bring health a risk of professional routine handling, so it is necessary to search for a biological fixative with the same qualities being less harmful to health.",

Treatments were in a completely randomized design, with the inclusion of cassava peel (0, 10, 20, 30\%) in the diet dry matter. Hay from the cassava shoot has been used as forage and the forage:concentrate ratio was 48:52. The experiment lasted 70 days and then the lambs underwent a fast for 16 hours, were slaughtered, and their carcasses remained at a temperature of 4°C for 24 hours. In cold carcass the Longissimus muscle were taken and frozen (4°C) until the analysis. The results for moisture, ashes and protein were not influenced by cassava peel, and a decreasing linear effect was observed for the lipids levels. In composition of unsaturated fatty acids, there was a linear effect for C15:0 and a quadratic effect for C14:0, C18:0 and C22:0. Regarding the monounsaturated fatty acids, a linear effect has been observed for C16:1, C18:1-9c and C22:1-9c, and a quadratic effect for C15:1, C17:1 and C20:1. With the polyunsaturated fatty acids, a linear effect was observed for CLA, C20:3n-6, C20:4n-6, C20:5n-3 and C22:6n-3, and a quadratic effect was seen for C20:2 and C18:3n-6.

Twenty-nine dogs diagnosed with pyometra, a pathology used as an experimental model for sepsis were evaluated. The animals were subjected to conventional echocardiography and 2D-FTI, and divided into three groups: Group I (control), group II (sepsis pyometra) and group III (no sepsis pyometra). Regarding the parameters of conventional echocardiography, there was no statistical difference between the groups. As for the radial Strain, group II and III had lower ventricular function at diagnosis (22.805.80 Group I; 18.455.96 Group II; 18.719.45 Group III; P = 0.032) and group III maintained this reduction in return. Regarding the radial Strain rate, only the III group had lower ventricular function at diagnosis (1.900.57 Group I; 1.910.70 Group II, 1.570.53 Group III; P = 0.021). For the Longitudinal Strain we observed lower ventricular function in groups II and III at diagnosis (11.043.38 Group I, Group II 8.593.97, 8.211.99; P = 0.048) and ten days after surgery (11.043.38 Group I; 9.002.16 Group II; 8.122.27 Group III; P = 0.048). The 2D-FTI was able to detect early changes in left ventricular function, suggesting myocardial depression frame, even in female dogs with pyometra without clear clinical picture of sepsis, which were not seen in conventional echocardiography. Thus, this model can be useful in diagnosis, because it can detect early cardiac changes, enabling a rapid therapeutic intervention.",

Validation of prognostic factors for this disease could help in detecting more severely affected animals and their exclusion from breeding programs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prognostic significance of presence of symptoms, heart rate variability (HRV) indices and ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias recorded by Holter monitoring on survival of Boxer dogs with ARVC at different stages. Symptoms, arrhythmias registered on Holter and five HRV indices were prospectively analyzed in 69 client-owned Boxer dogs divided into five groups: control Boxer dogs (CB group, 300 VPC/24 hours, n=19), Boxers with ARVC and systolic dysfunction without congestive heart failure (SDB without CHF group, n=6) and with CHF (SDB with CHF group, n=8). Statistical analyses consisted of an ANOVA test, Pearson correlation and Cox's proportional hazards regression. Compared to the CB group, no decrease in HRV indices was found in SB, ARVCB or SDB without CHF groups; otherwise, SDB with CHF group had impaired indices. No relation was found between HRV indices and cardiac-related death, but the presence of syncopes with or without clinical signs of heart failure and number of ventricular tachycardia (VT), were correlated with survival. These results allow us to conclude that the presence of symptoms of heart failure, presence of syncopes and number of VT on Holter examination seem to have prognostic value in Boxer ARVC.",

However, there are no studies that have evaluated the safety and reliability of the test Timed Up and Go (TUG) in hospitalized elderly. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and reproducibility of the TUG in hospitalized elderly. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study where three measurements of the TUG were collected for each elderly, being considered the best performance in seconds (sec). Other variables collected were cognitive function (MMSE), Charlson comorbidity index, admission profile (clinical or surgical), history of falls in the last year and BMI. To assess the relative reliability we used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and for the absolute reliability we used the Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The study included 68 elderly with a mean age 70.4 ± 7.7 years, Charlson index 5.4 ± 2.0 and prevalence of clinical profile (64.7\%). None of the 204 tests was interrupted by the established criteria. There was a gradual reduction between the first and third measurement (1st = 11.6 ± 6.54; 2nd = 10.7 ± 6.22 and 3rd = 10.3 ± 5.54; p = 0.001) and high ICC (1st and 2nd: ICC = 0.98; 1st and 3rd: ICC = 0.98; 2nd and 3rd: ICC = 0.98; p = 0.001), and the highest correlation with the best performance was associated with third measurement (ICC = 0.99; p = 0.001). We identified that the smallest bias (0.29 sec) and limits of concordance (-1.1 to 1.68 sec) also occurred between the third measurement and the best performance. The measure of the method error to evaluate the variability was 0.5 sec, and the clinically significant change was 3.4 sec. Conclusion: The TUG was a safe instrument with good reproducibility for measuring physical performance in hospitalized elderly.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases have been associated with the presence of musculoskeletal disorders. The presence of pain in these comorbidities may be a limiting factor for exercise practice. However, no instruments were found that provide more thorough measurement and accurate information that can be easily used in clinical practice. In this sense, the construction and validation of a more specific instrument becomes relevant to obtain detailed information on the presence and severity of these symptoms and its interference in the functional aspects, costs, and psychosocial factors at different times that result in a more precise evaluation. Thus, professionals of the multidisciplinary team involved in cardiopulmonary and metabolic rehabilitation (CPMR) programs can use it in clinical practice and put aside the strategies specifically directed to these conditions. Objectives: To construct and validate an instrument to assess musculoskeletal pain at rest and during exercise in participants of CPMR. Methods: Theoretical, empirical, and analytical procedures were performed. The concordance analysis among evaluators (judges) was verified by Kendall's W test, the internal consistency of the items through Cronbach's alpha, and reproducibility and stability measures through the test and retest (intraclass correlation coefficient - ICC and Kappa coefficient). Results: The concordance among evaluators was significant (p=0.001) and showed satisfactory internal consistency values (Cronbach's alpha > 0.82). The test-retest indicated good reproducibility and stability measures (ICC<0.40 and Kappa<0.60). Conclusion: The questionnaire for the evaluation of musculoskeletal pain in exercise practitioners (Q-ADOM) proved to be valid, reproducible, and reliable to be used in the evaluation of musculoskeletal pain in CPMR participants.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Aging is associated with a reduction in the speed of contraction and activation of muscle fibers, influencing physical fitness and functional performance. Objective: To verify the rate of force development (RFD) and neural activation in postmenopausal women. Methods: Twenty-four postmenopausal women (63.2±5.6 years; 154.5±7.3 cm and 64.7±7.6 kg) functionally independent and physically active were submitted simultaneously to the measurement of maximal isometric force and electromyographic signals (EMG) of the following muscles: vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), and vastus medialis (VM) for a unilateral extension of the knee of the dominant limb. These results were used to calculate the RFD, the contractile impulse in 20-ms intervals during the first 200ms of the muscle contraction by the force/time curve, the EMG activation rate (EAR), and the mean EMG amplitude, at intervals of 40 to 80ms from the start of the EMG integration by using the EMG/time curve. Results: The force values ranged from 29.19 to 86.04Nm; the RFD varied from 1459.42 to 430.21N.m.s-1 in 20ms and 200ms, respectively, indicating decreasing values with time; for the impulse values were observed between 0.65 and 11.07Nms; in the same direction of RFD, the EAR showed decreasing values for the VL (1676.08 to 844.41µVs-1), for the RF (1320.88 to 637.59µVs-1), and the VM (1747.63 to 914.09µVs-1) at 20 and 200ms, while the mean EMG amplitude had values of 33.77 to 50.32µV for the VL, 24.93 to 38.07µV for RF, and 37.07 to 54.78µV for the VM in 40ms and 80ms, respectively. Conclusion: In postmenopausal women, the increase rate, the maintenance of force, and the EMG activation are not sufficient to maintain the increase of RFD and EAR, demonstrating a potential risk of functional disabilities and falls.",

Physical training can be an alternative therapy to prevent or mitigate cardiopulmonary complications in this population. Objective: To evaluate the effects of training with adapted canoeing, consisting of combined exercise (aerobic and strength) on heart rate variability (HRV), pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength in paraplegics due to SCI. Methods: The study included six paraplegics, five men and one woman, average age of 31.50 ± 7.68 years and mean body mass index of 24.00 ± 1.13 kg/m², level of injury T4 to T9, who underwent training with adapted canoeing for three months. Subjects were evaluated by HRV, spirometry and manovacuometer before and after the training period. Results: After training there was no significant increase in RR (12.7\%), SDNN (24.3\%), rMSSD (50.0\%), pNN50 (478.6\%), LF (ms²) (53.3\%), HF (ms²) (158.8\%) SD1 (50.6\%), SD2 (23.2\%) and SampEn (20.2\%). The HF indices (un) and LF/HF showed no significant decrease of 5.7 and 7.0\%, respectively. The highest breathing gains were for MVV (9.7\%), MIP (8.5\%) and MEP (11.0\%), being however not significant. Conclusion: The proposed protocol of three months of adapted canoeing failed to promote significant effects on cardiopulmonary parameters evaluated in paraplegic subjects after SCI, but we observe the trend of improvement in most of these parameters. In this sense, probably the training stimulus was insufficient.",

Such loss can cause various organic disorders including dehydration, capable of compromising performance during exercise and harm health. Objective: To assess the water loss and hydration habits of college athletes of competitive futsal. Methods: Data were collected on two non-consecutive trainings (A and B), in which the variations of weight of 17 male athletes pre- and post-workout were checked. Specific formulas have been used for the evaluation of variations. The athletes drank 360 ml of water 40 minutes before training, and other liquid intake and urinary excretion were not allowed. Hydration habits were identified through a questionnaire containing objective questions related to the topic. Results: The water loss during training A was 1.02 ± 0.28 kg and during training B was 1.18 ± 0.44 kg, corresponding in percent dehydration of 1.40 ± 0.38\% and 1.59 ± 0.56\%, respectively. There was a significant difference between sweating rate of training A and training B (p < 0.0474). The whole group (100\%) used to hydrate during trainings and competitions; 52.95\% showed indifference to the type of beverage ingested; water is the most consumed hydrating solution (100\%), followed by natural juice (88.23\%) and coffee (76.47\%). The most important symptoms of the dehydration were intense thirst (88.23\%), feeling of loss of strength (82.35\%) and fatigue (82.35\%). Conclusion: The evidenced water loss in training was significant, as it implies the beginning of dehydration. Most athletes have inadequate hydration habits, especially when compared to the level of understanding of the subject. It is suggested the strengthening guidance and establishment of strategies aimed at ratifying the seriousness of the matter and mitigate potential risks associated with heat.",

Objective: To evaluate the effects of administration of verapamil and digoxin on heart morphology of rats subjected to interval training (IT). Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into groups (n = 8): Control, Digoxin (30.0µg.kg-1/day), Verapamil (5.0 mg.kg-1/day), Trained, Trained+digoxin and Trained+verapamil. The IT was performed on a treadmill (60 min/day/60 days) concurrently with the drugs administration. Fragments of the left ventricle (LV) were collected for histological analysis. Results: Digoxin and verapamil increased the total area of the LV (p<0.002), capillary/LV area (p<0.01) and cardiomyocytes area (p<2.8e-10), and in the latter variable, verapamil promoted even greater effect than digoxin. The IT increased LV/BW (p<4e-05), the inner diameter of the LV (p<2.7e-6), the area of cardiomyocytes (p<1.8e-6), and reduced the [Lac] (p<2.6e-5). There was interaction between IT and drugs in the total area (p<9.8e-5), capillaries (p<0.04), cell/area (p<0.004) and cardiomyocytes area (p <2.0e-16). Conclusions: Digoxin promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and when associated with IT, potentiated the hypertrophy. Verapamil was more efficient in increasing the cardiomyocytes area compared with digoxin, but only when isolated.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Sports injuries are disorders that have great impact on athletic performance. Objective: To develop and validate a questionnaire of pre-participation in sports that identifies athletes with risk factors or likelihood of musculoskeletal injury in order to select them for specialized medical evaluation. Methods: We used the Delphi Technique to gather information and reach a consensus of experts on a topic, which is not found in the related literature. The initial version of the Sport Readiness Questionnaire (MIR-Q) focusing on musculoskeletal injuries was based on the researcher's experience in the areas of sports orthopedics/traumatology and medicine of exercise and sport (MES) and was supported by theoretical references. Results: In the pilot phase, the analysis of the MIR-Q content was performed by nine specialists in MES. Of the seven initial questions, the question 5 was removed. In the first round of the Delphi Technique, 25 experts evaluated the six questions of the MIR-Q. The rounds were programmed to be repeated until the minimum agreement of 75\% was reached among the responses of the majority of specialists (over 50\%) for each question, through a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. In the round one, three questions were modified and consensus was reached (concordance of 80\% to 100\%), an index that varied from 75\% to 87.5\% as for reproducibility. The measure of the internal consistency of MIR-Q (Cronbach's alpha) was satisfactory both in the first round (0.70) and reproducibility phase (0.88). Conclusion: The present questionnaire proved to be a simple and valid tool from the point of view of content validity for screening athletes with probability of musculoskeletal injuries for referral to specialists.",

Currently, the crack spread across the world because it has greater potential for addiction compared to other drugs since users find it difficult to stop the use of crack and cope with craving and anxiety. It is essential to have a multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach to the user, with the use of cognitive-behavioral techniques that address the relapse prevention strategies. In this context, the cooperative games (CGs) and the relaxation breathing (RB) are possible strategies for therapeutic management. Objectives: To evaluate the use of CG and RB as craving and anxiety coping strategies in crack users in addiction situation. Methods: This is an exploratory research, almost experimental, with a quantitative approach, developed in a detoxification unit for chemical dependence in the state of Paraíba. Results: The sample consisted of 40 crack addict volunteers older than 18 years. To evaluate the effects of CG and RB on craving and anxiety the following instruments were used: Cocaine Craving Questionnaire-Brief (CCQ-B) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-E). The results showed that the CG and RB reduced the scores of the total craving and anxiety. As for the F1 factor, only CG showed satisfactory results. Conclusion: CG and RB demonstrated efficacy as coping strategies for craving and anxiety in crack users in addiction situation in the conditions under which the study was developed.",

This study aimed to describe the helminthological fauna, as well as the infection indicators, of the collared peccary (T. tajacu) coming from the Brazilian Amazon. Five adult peccaries (three males and two females) were captured in the Araguaína region, Tocantins, Brazil, with the aid of traps. The collared peccaries were reassured, chemically restrained and euthanized according to the Brazilian Good Practice Guide for Animal Euthanasy of the Federal Board of Veterinary Medicine. The species found were identified and the infection indicators were determined (infection rate, abundance, mean intensity and intensity variation). A total of 1394 helminths of nine nematode species were collected: Eucyathostomum dentatum, Cruzia brasiliensis, Monodontus semicircularis, Monodontus aguiari, Spiculopteragia tayassui, Texicospirura turki, Parabronema pecariae, Physocephalus sexalatus and Cooperia punctata. Helminths with higher percentages of infection were Physocephalus sexalatus, Parabronema pecariae and Monodontus aguiari found in 100\% of the examined animals; the latter was the most abundant (164) and had a highest mean intensity (164) and total number of helminths (820). In contrast, Spiculopteragia tayassui presented lower indicators, found only one female in this study. In this studythe the first occurrence of Cruzia brasiliensis parasitizing collared peccary (T.

Science was more related to issues of Medicine and Health. Scientists and experts were important sources of information, but citizens were heard about these issues as well. However, we found out that scientists were less represented on TV - and, when they appeared, there were more men than women scientists. In advertising,the most frequent television category in our corpus, science was used as a way to enforce credibility to the product, highlighting the social role of science.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: There has been a marked increase in the popularity of street running; consequently, more people are taking up this sport. Therefore, studies are seeking different approaches to this modality, aiming to unravel the mechanisms that compose it. Objective: To verify the incidence of injuries in street runners of Criciúma city, SC, as well as other related factors such as profile of practitioners, training characteristics, and the existence of professional monitoring. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study with 88 runners (56 men and 32 women) was conducted. Results: The mean age was 36 years, with most participants practicing running three times a week (55.4\%) and in the total sample, 43.2\% had an injury, with the knee (52.6\%) being the most commonly affected. Among those who had suffered injury, there was a strong correlation between the number of injuries and the time spent practicing this sport (r=0.269) and those who trained in higher average daily distances (r=0.226). However, the data showed that preventive work was not effective in reducing the incidence of lesions (r=-0.133). Conclusion: There is a direct relationship between the distance run and injury, as well as the time spent practicing the sport. Professional guidance does not have a significant influence in reducing injuries, i.e., many injuries may be due to the volume and intensity of training that is incorrectly prescribed or executed, not respecting the current physical condition and the biological individuality, targeting only the perspective to overcome the athlete's own limitations at any cost. We point out the importance of more studies that associate the progression of training, injuries, and prevention.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: The respiratory compensation point (RCP) is the metabolic rate for a maximal incremental test, from which the control of the acid-base balance is lost. However, the critical velocity (CV) defines the upper limit of the heavy exercise domain, in which the exhaustion is not related to metabolic disturbance. Objective: To compare the physiological (heart rate - HR, blood lactate - [La], and oxygen uptake - V̇O2) and perceptual (rating of perceived exertion - RPE) responses, while exercising at CV and at RCP, in order to analyze contextual similarities. Methods: Ten adolescent runners (15.8±1.7 years old) underwent progressive test (increments of 1.0 km×h-1 per minute until exhaustion) to determine V̇O2max, RCP and the correspondent velocities. The CV was estimated for three efforts with time limit of 2 to 12 minutes. The participants performed two efforts of seven minutes each on separate days, in CV and vRCP HR, RPE (scale 6-20) were recorded every minute, and [La] was measured at rest and after each effort. The V̇O2 was analyzed breath by breath during efforts. The Mann-Whitney test compared HR, [La], V̇O2, and RPE responses in CV and vRCP. The variance between these responses was examined by the scatter coefficient (R2). The significance level was P≤0.05. Results: The maximum values in the progressive test were 56.1±5.5 ml×kg-1×min-1 (V̇O2max), 16.5±1.7 km×h-1 (vV̇O2max), 202±12 bpm (HRmax), 19.4±1.3 (RPE) and 12.7±3.1 mmol×L-1 ([La]). No differences were observed between CV (at 83.8±3.6\% vV̇O2max) and vRCP (at 86.5±3.6\% vV̇O2max) in RPE responses (P=0.761), HR (P=0.096), [La] (P=0.104) and V̇O2 (P=0.364) responses. Correlations were observed between the CV and vRCP in [La] (R2=0.76; P=0.011), RPE (R2=0.84; P<0.01) and V̇O2max (R2=0.82; P<0.01) responses. Conclusion: It was inferred that exercise in RCP reproduced a physiological and perceptual response similar to that in CV.",

However, there is little information on the impact of interval exercises on blood pressure response in 24 hours. Objective: To compare subacute and acute pressure responses of a continuous and interval aerobic exercise session and identify possible modulations in autonomic activity indicators in normotensive adults. Methods: Twenty-five healthy normotensive adults underwent three experimental sessions: control (30 minutes at rest), continuous exercise (30 min, 60-70\% HRres) and interval exercise (six 5-minute sessions with 2 min intervals - 60-70\% HRres), and their cardiovascular parameters were monitored for 24 hours after sessions. To compare the data, we used ANOVA for repeated measures, followed by their hypotheses. Results: Significant reduction was identified in the subacute follow-up (P < 0.05) in systolic blood pressure only after continuous exercise session, compared to the rest session(115±2 mmHg vs. 112±2 mmHg) and control (119±2 mmHg vs. 112±2 mmHg) sessions. No ambulatory blood pressure reduction was found in any of the experimental sessions. The parasympathetic autonomic indicators (RMSSD and pNN50) remained reduced after 30 minutes in both exercise sessions. Conclusion: A single continuous aerobic exercise session causes subacute reduction in blood pressure in normotensive adults. A single session of continuous and interval aerobic exercise does not promote reduction of ambulatory blood pressure in interim periods of sleep and wakefulness.",

A therapeutic option that has shown promising results is the intra-articular infusion of hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation), with or without exercise and diet to lose weight. Objective: To assess the response to treatment of post-traumatic arthritis of the knee with use of viscosupplementation with or without exercise. Methods: We evaluated the arc of joint motion, popliteal retraction angle, visual pain scale, Lysholm score, and thigh circumference in patients undergoing surgical correction of the tibial plateau fracture at our institution, which, after surgical and physical therapy discharge, were treated with viscosupplementation in a single infusion with or without programmed exercise during follow-up of 12 months. Results: There was significant difference in favor of the group subjected to viscosupplementation associated with exercises for the retraction popliteal angle (p=0.012) and thickness of the thigh 10 cm above the patella (p=0.047). In all the other variables, the results in this group were also higher, but did not reach the corresponding statistical significance. All patients would be willing to repeat the infusion after 12 months. Conclusion: The viscosupplementation brought improvement in pain and function to patients with post-traumatic arthritis of the knee and the improvement is greater when exercises are associated in follow-ups of 12 months.",

The subjects affected by visual impairment have more difficulty to maintain balance, as the view is one of the senses involved in this complex process. To improve such physical motor skills, and hence the life quality of these subjects, it is necessary to improve the other proprioception systems. One method for this is functional training. Objective: To analyze the effects of functional training on proprioception and balance of visually impaired persons. Methods: This case study evaluated three subjects with total blindness or low vision, during a functional training program that took 12 weeks with two sessions per week. Postural balance was evaluated on a force platform in bipedal condition and blindfolded. The evaluation of proprioception of the upper limbs was performed with a cinesiometer and the evaluation of the lower limbs was performed by fixing a fleximeter to the dominant knee joint of the participant, both blindfolded. The results were analyzed descriptively using multivariate analysis of time series. Results: All subjects showed improvement in postural balance. With respect to the proprioception of upper limbs, the subject 1 (S1) showed improvement, and regarding the proprioception of the lower limbs all subjects showed improvement. Conclusion: Thus, the results suggest that functional training had a positive effect on balance and on proprioception of these individuals.",

In this context, the beneficial effects of nutraceuticals and bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, have mobilized several studies. Objective: To evaluate the consumption of polyphenols in the diet of practitioners of physical activity, associating it to the nutritional knowledge and time spent on this practice. Methods: This is a quantitative transversal study. The sample consisted of 35 men with a mean age of 27.9 years, practitioners of physical activity in a fitness center in the city of São Leopoldo, RS, Brazil. Data were collected through a food survey, a socio-demographic questionnaire and a nutritional knowledge scale and then analyzed. The polyphenols ingested in the diet were measured using the Phenol-Explorer database. The polyphenols average were compared between groups using the t-test for independent samples. The normality of the data for the consumption of polyphenols was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results: The average weekly time spent by individuals in the sample in the practice of physical activity was 291.7±117.5 minutes, and those who practiced exercises for a longer period consumed more dietary polyphenols. Conclusion: When analyzing the consumption of polyphenols, it was observed that all participants had regular intake, but in lower proportions than suggested by several studies. When evaluating the quality of the diet it was found that the majority consumed fruits and vegetables, despite differences in relation to adequate knowledge about the nutritional relevance of these foods.",

Basketball involves short-time maximum effort for changes of direction, which use anaerobic metabolism and agility. Objective: To examine the variation in performance in the Line-drill Test in adolescent basketball players (n=59, age 9-15 years) in relation to the stage of somatic maturity (estimated age of peak growth velocity [PGV]) and the variation in body size. Methods: We considered chronological age, estimated time for the age of PGV by the maturity offset protocol, height and body mass measured by anthropometry, and performance in the Line Drill Test. Proportional allometric models were used to control the variation associated with the body size, chronological age, and maturity of inter-individual variation in the Line-drill Test. Results: We found a high negative linear relationship between performance in the Line-drill Test and chronological age (r=-0.64, 95\% IC -0.77 - -0.46, p<0.01). The relationship between performance on the Line-drill Test and the time until the age of PGV proved to be non-linear, indicating slowdown in performance variation, approximately from the age of PGV and one year after the predicted PGV. The allometric models showed a negative relationship between body size and performance in the Line-drill Test. The amplitude of variance explained in the proportional allometric models ranged from 0.28 to 0.48. Negative exponents of small magnitude were observed for chronological age and the indicator of maturity being, however, significant and with reduced amplitude (-0.05 to -0.06) Conclusion: The use of allometric models to control the influence of body size can potentially help to understand the development of agility performances in adolescent basketball players.",

Objective: To investigate the chronic effects of stroke on aerobic capacity (VO2peak) and the indices of heart rate variability (HRV), and if there is a correlation between these two variables. Methods: Eleven male individuals aged 55 to 65 affected by cerebrovascular injury for at least six months all with hemiparesis were assessed. The following evaluations were performed: maximum aerobic capacity test, record of R-R intervals and calculation of the indices of HRV (RMSSD, pNN50, HF, LF and LF/HF ratio). For the comparison between expected and obtained VO2peak the unpaired Student's t-test was used. To test the hypothesis of correlation between HRV indices and VO2peak the Pearson correlation test was used. Results: VO2peak (mL.kg-1.min-1) expected and obtained, respectively = 32.15±1.87 and 16.12±5.51; HRV indices: RMSSD (ms) = 28.69±26.78; pNN50 (\%) = 8.76±12.62; HF (n.u.) = 51.96±22.4; LF (n.u.) = 48.04±22.49. The VO2peak correlated negatively with the RMSSD, pNN50 and HF indices; and positively with LF (p<0.05). Conclusion: In the chronic phase of stroke, the heart rate variability is normal and individuals with lower aerobic capacity have higher parasympathetic modulation and lower sympathetic modulations, probably due to the higher physical demand on physical activities of daily living.",

A lower risk of injury is connected to the ankle joint stability, which can be acquired by proprioceptive training, used for rehabilitation and prevention of injuries. Objective: To evaluate the effect of a proprioceptive training for the ankle joint through the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) in sedentary students and compare results with those obtained with the same training in volleyball athletes. Methods: Eleven sedentary students with no history of lower limb injuries participated in a proprioceptive training to the ankles during four weeks. The students were evaluated using the SEBT before and after the protocol of proprioceptive training. After obtaining the pre and post-test averages, they were analyzed intragroup and compared with a database study using the same methodology, but with volleyball players. Results: The paired t test was used to compare the means of both ankles pre and post intervention in students. To compare the outcomes of students with those of the athletes we used the independent t test. We adopted the level of significance 5\% (p≤0.05), and analyzes were performed with SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 18. The results of the SEBT testing of the students, pre and post intervention, showed significant differences in three directions for the right ankle and four directions for the left. The differences between students and the athletes were significant for two directions on the right ankle and for three directions on the left. Conclusion: The proprioceptive training is effective to increase the stability of both sedentary students as athletes, indicating that can be an important means to prevent future injuries.",

Obesity and physical inactivity are predisposing components to the worsening of metabolic risk factors and treatment is fundamental aiming at improving the health of young people. Objective: To verify the effect of 12 weeks of an intervention focused on physical activity on metabolic risk factors in obese children. Methods: The final sample consisted of 19 students aged between 8 and 10 years (10 in the pedometer group and nine in the control group). Physical activity was measured and guided by the Yamax(r) sw 700 pedometer (Tokyo, Honshu, Japan). For within and between groups comparisons the two way ANOVA was applied for repeated measures with significance set at p<0.05. Results: The number of steps increased significantly only in the pedometer group after the 12-week intervention (9729.7±2539.8 before vs. 13151.6±3581.7 after). Significant increase was observed in body weight, height, and BMI in the control group. In the pedometer group, it was observed significant increase only in stature. Regarding the metabolic risk factors, there was no significant change found in the control group, while in the pedometer group a significant decrease in insulin levels was observed (12.21±8.53 before vs. 7.26±4.70 µUI/ml after) and HOMA IR (2.76±1.93 before vs. 1.49±0.93 after). Conclusion: This intervention with physical activity from setting goals using pedometers significantly reduced the concentrations of insulin and the homeostasis index (HOMA IR) in obese children regardless of weight loss.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT: Coendou prehensilis is a mammal that belongs to the Rodentia order, which consists of five suborders: Sciuromorfos, to which the squirrels belongs; Castorimorfos where we have the beavers; Myomorfos, which include the mice; Anomaluromorfos, Hare jumper, and Hystricomorfos, where we have the capybara. We used the porcupine clerk in the research (Coendou prehensilis), one male and one female, both adults. These animals were transferred to the Laboratory of Anatomy, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of São Paulo (FZEA/USP), originating from roadaccidents in Pirassununga, SP (Registration n. 43274-1 SISBIO). The animals were fixed with 10\% formaldehyde and dissected in the perineum region. The results showed that the only feature which allows us to differentiate males from females is the space between anus and the genitals of the animals; the male has a larger space than the female. The perineum is an extra cavity region with lozenge definition, and this definition is formed by interpubic bones, the pubic and processes of the pubic and ischium. The male Coendou prehensilis perineum consists of five major muscles, three arranged on the urogenital diaphragm surface (ischiocavernosus muscles, M. bulbocavernosus and Mm. bulboesponjosos) and two in the pelvic diaphragm (M. levator ani and M. penis retractor). The female's perineum is composed by ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, levator ani and external anal sphincter muscles. We conclude that both sexes have the ischiocavernosus muscles, Mm. bulboesponjosos, M. levator ani and external anal sphincter, and it is very important to study the perineal region of the animals, because understanding the function and location of each muscle we can contribute to future research on reproduction and animal behavior during copulation, helping to a better knowledge about reproductive potential of Erethizontidae rodents, and to contribute in the applied biotechnology development of reproduction, what can be helpful even in captivity reproduction of these animals besides the ones in free environment.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Palliative Care (PC) is a multidisciplinary team approach that deals with patients and their families under conditions of life-threatening illness aimed at improving their quality of life. With the increase of chronic-degenerative diseases, it is estimated that 20 million patients in the world require this type of care. With regard to medical training geared toward this demand there is scarce mention of PC in the National Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Medical Courses. However, when the official text is reviewed, several parallels can be drawn between the general guidelines and the principles of PC, such as humanistic training, prioritization of vulnerable patients, valuing human dignity, bioethics, respect for the patient's autonomy, person-centered approach, team work, family approach, communication and evidence-based practices. The study of these common points shows PC to be a potential educational strategy for the acquisition of required skills and competencies according to the official guidelines. In this regard, the inclusion of PC in undergraduate medical courses will broaden the professional training of future physicians, as well as helping guarantee quality care for seriously ill patients, especially those in the final stages of their lives.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical students' views on health and illness in the early stages of their degree course depend on their knowledge and past experiences as well as the amount of contact with medical practice and the reality surrounding this issue. The aim of this study was to understand the view of health and illness in the minds of future doctors and to delineate the relationships established between the notion of health and illness, the school curriculum, personal experiences, and the social and professional students' trajectory throughout the course. A qualitative study was conducted, with a psychosocial questionnaire and semi-structured interviews used on students in the first, third, and sixth year at the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp-EPM) in 2008. The material was subjected to content analysis, identifying the experiences and personal characteristics of each participant, as well their curricular and extracurricular experiences, and determining how the hidden curriculum influences both their views on health and illness as well as their career choice. A certain coldness may be noted in the doctor-patient relationship, as well as a greater distrust of patients. Graduating students demonstrated a need to protect feelings aroused by their experiences of the medical course. It is clear that students are aware of a more global and human view of their patients, however, it seems that they know this merely cognitively and are emotionally unable to put it into practice. This issue may be linked to the fact that they experience difficulties dealing with the emotional aspects of the doctor-patient relationship.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective This study aimed to identify stress, personality traits and social skills among students at two medical schools in Tocantins during their clerkship period. Methodology A sample of 50 clerkship students was given a questionnaire on biographical data and aspects of the clerkship, along with three psychological tests: Lipp's Stress Symptoms Inventory, the Personality Factorial Battery, and the Social Skills Inventory. Results The population under study showed signs of stress (52\%), with a predominance of psychological symptoms potentially constituting an illness, but rarely seen as such (resistance phase). Personality characteristics such as low openness to ideas, poor communication skills, high commitment, and instability were also registered. Parallel to this was our identification of a repertoire of low social skills in terms of the self-assertion skills required in the expression of positive feelings. Some students also needed expert (psychologist and psychiatrist) assistance during the course with complaints unaddressed. Conclusion The correlational analyses suggest that neuroticism and levels of communication and trust in others are different in people experiencing stress. This aspect, along with a difficulty in expressing positive emotions, indicates one way a predisposing factor may develop into stress among medical students. This may be added to personality traits and their associated behavior trends, during one of the tensest phases of medical school (clerkship).",

The theoretical and methodological references used are authors who discuss the teaching-learning and language area processes, as well as discourse analysis. Instruments employed includeconversation circle techniques, field diaries and observations. Language repertoires were identified from the students' comments, with a focus on the controversies of the speech, which formed seven sets of directions. Based on the students' opinions, our conclusion is that the use of atutoring strategy inspired by Problem-Based Learning in more traditional curricula may serve as an alternative for instigating curricular change processes in order to build more meaningful learning, provided there is coherent planning with the course's teaching goals, resulting in the development of autonomy, critical thinking, respect and learning from differences, which are important skills to be developed by future doctors.",

The new 2014 Guidelines strengthened the changes in order to promote greater integration between teaching and service. One change instigated by UNICAMP Faculty of Medical Sciences was to place students in Primary healthcare (PHC) activities from the first year, including the addition of an Integral Healthcare subject in the fourth year, where students experience the reality of primary healthcare in Basic Health Units (UBS) over the course of the academic year. Objective To assess student interest in working as doctors in APS. Method A structured questionnaire was sent to students in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th years of medical school in 2012, before, during, and after the course. The Integral Healthcare subject was created and implemented as part of the curriculum reform with the aim that the students would be immersed in APS, with responsibilities and doctor-patient bonds, meeting the DCNs and training physicians to the population's needs. The other subjects related to teaching-service integration that were already part of the residency underwent adjustments during the reform but no transformations. Results A change in student interest in working in PHC was registered, rising from 20.9\% in the 3rd year of medicine, as confirmed by previous studies, to 47\% in the 6th year. The group responses were statistically compared and analyzed, and suggested that the earlier inclusion in the public healthcare network with teaching-service integration was effective at shifting the students' desire to work as medical professionals in PHC. Care with teaching during residencies at UBS with teachers and tutors demonstrating quality and resoluteness in attending the public may have influenced this change in the will to work as professionals in the Municipal Health Network in the future.",

Infection with this virus is the main alteration required for the occurrence of cervical cancer. This study aims to evaluate the academic level of knowledge among students at a private university in Curitiba, using questionnaires on nursing, dentistry and medicine courses. By means of a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study, prospective data was collected through a questionnaire given to students at the Universidade Positivo in Curitiba from June to August, 2014. 527 questionnaires were given to students, with 29.5\% (N = 155) of respondents male and 70.4\% (N = 369) female, and a mean age of 21.85 years (SD = 4.38). The number of correct answers was higher in medical school in nearly all questions. In terms of preventing HPV, most students knew how HPV is transmitted, with 56.6\% (N = 272) correctly quoting more than one preventive method and 41.3\% (N = 212) reporting that the vaccine is the most effective preventive method. In terms of knowledge of situations that increase the risk of transmission, most students felt that multiple partners represented a greater risk than not using condoms. Although 86.4\% (N = 434) stated that they have heard of HPV, 76.8\% (N = 398) reported that HPV may have symptoms and only 13\% (N = 69) knew the long-term effects. Of all sexually active students, 75.57\% (N = 396) used contraceptive methods, with the oral contraceptive used by 61\% (N = 137), followed by the male condom with 33\% (N = 73). 63\% (N = 193) of sexually active female students with a regular partner conducted annual visits to their gynecologist, and of these, 14\% (N = 44) never used prevention.

Patterns of exploitation of feed stations were evaluated from direct observation of two animals (1/observer) per experimental unit with recording of codes (steps, bites, and other activities in a portable recorder device. The evaluations were performed twice a day (10 and 15h) during one hour, at the first and the last day of stocking period. Moreover, at pre and post-grazing were evaluated: herbage mass, leaf mass and sheath, and extended tiller height. The experimental design was a complete randomized block design with three replications and four treatments. The variables steps per minute, number of bites per feeding station, and bite rate were higher in lower pastures decreasing as the sward height increased in the initial phase with no difference in the final phase of grazing down. During the initial phase of the grazing down the animals presented differences in displacement patterns, where sward heights of 20 to 25cm in Kikuyu grass presented better conditions for foraging by grazing animals. Grazing down pastures to 50\% of initial grazing height negatively affects displacement patterns of animals, irrespective of pre-grazing heights targets.",

This work reports the case of a dog with a tumor in the pelvic limb that was treated surgically and received the catheter for cancer chemotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, an uncommon tumor in dogs that usually affects the joints and requires multimodal therapy. The treatment was done in two steps, in the first the limb was amputated and in the second the Port-a-Cath implantation and the excision of the metastatic nodule were performed. The dog responded well to surgery and chemotherapy sessions held with proper functioning of the catheter, and died from other causes 90 days after the procedure. The implantation of Port-a-Cath for chemotherapy is a great ally of multimodal therapy recommended for cancer, so this catheter may be considered for patients requiring chemotherapy medication for a long period.",

For the production of haylage, this plant remained cut in the field until it had 70\% of dry matter, when it was collected. Twelve Quarter Horse mares, aged 8-12 years, with average weight of 451.58kg were used. The animals were distributed randomly into two groups (n= 6), group 1 fed hay and group 2 fed haylage, both for 28 days. Blood samples were collected at one week intervals each for determining the hematological parameters. In the erythrogram, a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume and mean cell volume after the administration in both groups were detected. The white blood count increased in both groups, but the values remained within normal limits without clinical significance.

The measured angles of joints were shoulder-floor, scapulohumeral, humerus-radial, metacarpal-phalangeal, pelvis-floor, pelvis-femoral, femoral-tibial-patellar, tibial-tarsal-metatarsal and metatarsal-phalangeal. The statistical model considered the effects of sex, race and sex x race interaction with means compared byt the SNK test at 5\% significance level. There was sex x race interaction for all the features of heights and widths for the neck length measures, the back-loin, rump, shoulder, arm, forearm and fore cannon lenght and angulation just scapulohumeral while the race had effect for all angular measurements (P<0.01) except the radial-humeral.

Osteosynthesis alone is often insufficient to provide satisfactory outcomes in large animals; therefore, several research efforts have been made to investigate and develop bone substitutes capable of promoting bone regeneration.

Six Santa Inês ewes were submitted to the creation of experimental 7mm wide unicortical defects on the dorsomedial aspect of the proximal III/IV metacarpal bone diaphysis. Limbs were randomly selected for treatment with chitosan-collagen-hydroxyapatite composite or to serve as untreated controls. Biopsy fragments were collected from the bone/new bone or the bone/biomaterial interface (control and treated defects respectively) within 60 days of surgery; composite biocompatibility was assessed using light and scanning electron microscopy. Histomorphometric analysis under light microscopy revealed greater percentage of new bone tissue in control compared to treated defects (80\% and 63.5\% respectively; P<0.05). No scar tissue formation, foreign body or chronic inflammatory reactions were observed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed invasion of the composite by new bone tissue.

Four deferring periods (73, 103, 131 and 163 days) and two forage samples (available in pasture (AP) and obtained by hand-plucking (HP)) were studied. The live leaf laminae (LLL), potentially digestible dry matter (PDDM) and crude protein (CP) percentages were higher in HP samples, when compared to AP forage. The opposite response pattern occurred for live stem (LS), dead stem (DS) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) percentages. In general, the longest deferring period resulted in a worse morphological composition and nutritive value of forages. The potential selectivity index (PSI) of LLL, LS and dead leaf lamina (DLL) increased linearly with deferring period. The PSI of DS was highest in grasslands under interim deferring periods. With increase in deferring period, the PSI of the NDF and PDDM remained constant, the PSI of potentially digestible NDF and CP decreased linearly and the PSI of indigestible NDF increased linearly. The PSI allows the understanding of selectivity of morphological components and nutritional entities for cattle grazing. The deferring period reduction improves the sward structure and optimizes the cattle selectivity.",

A total of 47 alleles, ranging in size from 118bp to 330bp were found. The results of observed heterozygosity average (0.490 to 0.625) reflected a high intra-population genetic variability. The values of genetic distance (0.149 to 0.773), Fst (0.006 to 0.218), and Nm (1.2 to 4.2) showed that between the populations there is genetic similarity. According to AMOVA there was higher variation within populations than between them. The dendrogram demonstrated the formation of two groups (LMO-PRO-MOG and BAR-BAB-NAV). It was concluded that wild populations had high genetic variability with genetic similarity between them, possibly caused by the restocking program performed in these rivers.",

The present study compared three types of data for the representation of the productive profile of the dairy livestock in Brazil: the productive percentage, the productive density, and quantitative efficiency. The municipalities that led the production in the productive percentage were larger (52,460 ha in pasture), with a high number of low production cows; on the other hand, the productive density grouped the smaller (8,084 ha in pasture) with few high production cows. The best representation was for the quantitative efficiency that grouped municipalities of intermediate size (23,234 ha in pasture) with a high number of cows with high production. The quantitative efficiency constitutes a new approach for the representation of dairy farming, its application integrates the criteria quantity and efficiency, and reduces problems caused by the high variation in the size of the municipal areas.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aspartame supplementation on dietary intake, physical, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in 18 male Wistar rats, at five weeks old (young mice) treated for 21 days. The animals were randomly assigned into two groups: control group (CG) - treated with distilled water by gavage and aspartame group (GA) - treated with 2ml/100g/day of aspartame. All animals received commercial feed (Essence (r)) and water ad libitum. The control of food intake was recorded weekly. The physical parameters were measured by analyzing the body weight, chest circumference, waist circumference, vertex-coccyx length, total abdominal fat and calculating the body mass index; biochemical parameters were analyzed by glucose, high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. Apart from such analysis the histopathological study of the liver was conducted. Throughout the experiment the rats treated with aspartame showed a significant increase in body weight and food intake compared to the control group. There was no difference in other analyzes such physical, biochemical, and histopathological comparing GA to GC (P<0.05). From the results we can infer a greater chance of developing obesity, coming from the regular consumption of this type of sweetener, as it proved able to stimulate food intake, and hence the gain of body weight.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the fractions of the sardine protein waste hydrolysate fractions on feed intake and ammonia excretion of silver catfish. The soluble and insoluble fractions of the sardine muscle hydrolysate, evaluated individually and in combination were tested. Juvenile silver catfish (9.76±0.55g) were divided into twelve 20L aquaria, in the density of four fish per tank, resulting in an average biomass of 1.90±0.17g/L. The protein hydrolysate was produced with fresh sardine carcasses using the enzyme Protamex(r) bacterial protease (Novozymes A/S) and soluble and insoluble fractions were derived. The diets were isonitrogenous (39\% CP) and isocaloric (4450kcal EB/kg) and the hydrolysate fractions were included in order to provide 50\% of the protein of the diet. The soluble fraction has higher degree of hydrolysis (20.1\%) compared to the insoluble fraction (9.97\%). The two diets containing the hydrolysate soluble fraction were the most consumed. With 5 hours of evaluation, the diet containing the hydrolysate soluble fraction increased the excretion of ammonia in relation to diet containing the insoluble fraction. After 25 hours, the soluble fraction also increases the excretion of ammonia but this time in relation to the diet containing a combination of two fractions. It was concluded that the inclusion of the sardine protein hydrolysate soluble fraction in the diet stimulates the silver catfish feed intake, but when inclusion is high it can increase ammonia excretion of juvenile silvercatfish.",

This research aimed to evaluate by radiography and CT scan examinations the use of a hybrid modular total hip prosthesis developed and made in Brazil, applied experimentally in healthy dogs. Six skeletally mature dogs, which previously underwent surgery on the left hip joint were used. The dogs underwent CT scan at 360 days and three years after surgery. All animals showed good positioning of prosthetic components, and proper joint reduction. In the CT scan, however, it was possible to detect irregular fill areas in some animals. In addition, CT scan allowed the detection and monitoring of areas of bone resorption around the acetabular component. Therefore, the CT scan was useful in the evaluation of prosthetic joints, with the advantage of optimum sharpness of the images and allowing for the possibility of quantifying peri-prosthetic changes and measure joint, fundamental relations for late postoperative follow-up.",

Results The final Brazilian version of the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-26B) had 8 factors instead of 9 from the original American and Portuguese versions. This change was due to the merger of Fear and Dangerousness factors. Question 11 was removed from the Brazilian version because it did not present adequate psychometric values.

It was possible to see that clinical propaedeutic in the medical area and the guide of hard-technologies and the `prescriptions' in clinical approach, rather than the centrality of the subject. In addition, medical students demonstrated lack of knowledge of the service organization, revealing a gap between education and work. In different clinics, even when there was an examination of the oral cavity, connections between finds and symptoms presented by patients were not established. The experience of clinics in the Health Center showed the focus on what ``the body left over'' when the mouth was removed. Thus, the body-mouth disconnection is reinforced in the medical area.",

Experimental studies have shown that intravascular injection causes intense vacuolization of the contrast agent in the proximal renal tubules cells, preceding the increase in serum creatinine, and that the female may be at a higher risk for CIN. Objective: To study the early kidney histomorphometric changes in contrast-induced nephropathy according to the gender. Methods: Twenty previously uninephrectomized Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 5): control males; control females; contrast exposed males; and contrast exposed females. The animals were sacrificed immediately after contrast administration and kidney tissue samples were collected for histomorphometric analysis. The research project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of Universidade Federal Fluminense. Results: There was a more intense presence of microvacuoles in proximal tubules in the rats exposed to contrast than in the control groups. Such proximal tubular vacuolation was more intensive in the female rats (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Proximal tubular vacuolation is a very early change in CIN and is more intensive in female than in male rats.",

 abstract = "Abstract Introduction: Obstructive uropathies are main diseases affecting the fetus. Early diagnosis allows to establish the appropriate therapy to minimize the risk of damage to kidney function at birth. Biochemical markers have been used to predict the prognosis of renal function in fetuses. Uromodulin, also known by Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is exclusively produced in the kidneys and in normal conditions is the protein excreted in larger amounts in human urine. It plays important roles in kidneys and urinary tract. Also it participates in ion transport processes, interact with various components of the immune system and has a role in defense against urinary tract infections. Moreover, this protein was proved to be a good marker of renal function in adult patients with several renal diseases. Objective: To evaluate if uromodulin is produced and eliminated by the kidneys during fetal life by analyzing fetal urine and amniotic fluid and to establish correlation with biochemical parameter of renal function already used in Fetal Medicine Center at the Clinic Hospital of UFMG (CEMEFE/HC). Methods: Between 2013 and 2015, were selected 29 fetuses with indication of invasive tests for fetal diagnosis in monitoring at the CEMEFE/HC. Results: The determination of uromodulin was possible and measurable in all samples and showed statistically significant correlation with the osmolarity. Conclusion: There was a tendency of lower levels of Uromodulin values in fetuses with severe renal impairment prenatally. Thus, high levels of this protein in fetal amniotic fluid or fetal urine dosages possibly mean kidney function preserved.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence of ACL and meniscal injuries in a population of recreational and elite athletes from Brazil and the relation of these injuries with their sports activities. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 240 patients with ACL and/or meniscal injuries submitted to surgical treatment. Data of patients and sport modality, as well as Tegner score were registered in the first clinical evaluation. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) isolated rupture of the ACL; (2) ACL injury associated with meniscal injury; (3) isolated menisci injury. RESULTS: The majority of the patients belonged to group 1 (44.58\%), followed by group 2 (30.2\%) and 3 (25\%). Most patients were soccer players. The mean time from sport practice to injury in group 1 was 17.81 years. In group 2, it was 17.3 years, and in group 3, 26.91 years. Soccer athletes presented ACL injury in 0.523/1000 h of practice and meniscal injury in 0.448/1000 h of practice. Before the injury, the mean Tegner score obtained for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 7.18, 7.34, and 6.53, respectively. After knee injury, those values were 3.07, 3.18, and 2.87, respectively. CONCLUSION: Soccer was the sport that caused the majority of lesions, regardless the group. Furthermore, patients from groups 1 and 2 had less time of practice prior to the injury (17.81 and 17.3 years) than the patients of group 3 (26.91 years). Women presented a higher risk to develop ACL and meniscal injuries in 1000 h of game/practice. Running, volleyball, and weightlifting are in ascending order of risk for ACL and/or meniscal injury. Regarding the return to sport practice, the efficiency of all athletes was impaired because of the injury.",

Methods: Uncontrolled, intervention, cross-sectional, quantitative study with children admitted to a public university hospital. The intervention was performed by medical students dressed as clowns and included magic tricks, juggling, singing with the children, making soap bubbles and comedic performances. The intervention time was 20min. Vital signs were assessed in two measurements with an interval of 1min immediately before and after the interaction. Non-verbal communication was observed before and during the interaction using the Non-Verbal Communication Template Chart, a tool in which non-verbal behaviors are assessed as effective or ineffective in the interactions. Results: The sample consisted of 41 children with a mean age of 7.6±2.7 years; most were aged 7-11 years (n=23; 56\%) and were males (n=26; 63.4\%). There was a statistically significant difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pain and non-verbal behavior of children with the intervention.

Based on this evidence, a care protocol is suggested. Conclusions: The Federal Council of Medicine resolution 1021/1980, the penal code Article 135, which classifies denial of care as a crime and the Supreme Court decision on the HC 268,459/SP process imposes on the physician the obligation of blood transfusion when life is threatened.

The aim of this study was to assess the opinion of patients on recovery from anesthesia for lower limb orthopedic surgeries. We also identified potential predictive factors for poor quality of recovery. Methods: We evaluated patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgeries and able to participate in the study. Data related to surgery, anesthesia, possible complications in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) and in the ward were recorded. In the morning after surgery, patients were evaluated by a medical student who applied the QoR-40 questionnaire. The resulted score—between 40 and 200—was used to determine the quality of recovery and identify the potential predictors. Results: We evaluated 172 patients. The questionnaire average score was 192 points. The chance to have lower scores in the QoR-40 was two times higher among males. Patients who remained under sedation, classified as greater than or equal to 4 on the scale proposed by Ramsay, had a 3.5 times higher risk of having lower scores in the QoR-40 compared to those who remained with level 1 or 2 of sedation. Regarding pain, at every increase of one unit in the numerical scale (0-10), there was a 19\% increase in risk for QoR-40 ≤ 195. Similarly, the risk for a score below the median was 2.3 times higher among those presenting with nausea and/or vomiting in the ward. Conclusion: Male, nausea, vomiting, pain while in the ward, and deeper levels of sedation are possible predictive factors for lower scores according to the adopted instrument.",

 abstract = "Abstract Introduction: Facet joint pain is a common source of non-radicular back pain worldwide. Non-surgical interventional modalities remain the mainstay in the treatment of facetogenic back pain and comprise the second most commonly performed interventional pain procedures in the USA. Case: A 36 year-old man with chronic cervical pain secondary to C6-C7 facet arthrosis radiographically, underwent diagnostic local anesthetic bilateral facet joint injection under fluoroscopic guidance. The left side was injected uneventfully; however, 1-2 min following injection of the right side the patient complained of unwellness and became very anxious. He referred paresthesias of the bilateral upper extremities, chest and upper abdomen. Physical examination showed sensory deficits roughly from C5 to T7 without motor deficits; resuscitation measures were not warranted. The deficits were completely resolved by 35-40 min in the recovery area. Discussion: Facet joint injections are a common and safe method of treating back pain secondary to facet arthropathy. Despite excellent safety profiles, rare and sometimes, life-threatening complications can occur. Our case hypothesizes intrathecal injection of local anesthetic during facet joint injection. Few reports have described similar situations. We hypothesize a mechanism of entry through the facet joint, given the proximity of the ligamentum flavum, and the intrathecal space to the anterior aspect of the facet joint. This report reinforces the need for resuscitation and airway management equipment to be readily available where interventional procedures are performed, as well as the need for adequate proficiency in airway management and resuscitation techniques in Pain Medicine training.",

The assessment comprehended their heart and respiratory rates, systolic blood pressure and intestinal motility at basal levels and, then, 60 and 120 minutes after the oral administration of the drugs. Rilmenidine decreased heart rate on the two tested doses, which did not occur in the clonidine treatment; slight variations in systolic blood pressure in all treatments and respiratory rate reduction in treatments with rilmenidine at 0.021 mg/kg and clonidine at 0.002 mg/kg were also observed.

Receiving much less publicity (and virtually no accountability), the medical experiments carried out on a smaller scale by Japanese doctors during World War II taught also painful lessons. Other countries have also experienced genocide though with less medical involvement.

 abstract = "Abstract The use of biomaterials capable of generating a biological response has been one of the biggest progresses in regenerative medicine, due to their ability to support growth stimulation and damaged tissue regeneration. In this context, bioceramics, particularly bioactive glass (BG), were the subject of many studies. The technique of porogen agent addition for the synthesis of scaffolds is an interesting procedure, because several types of porogen agents can be used. The aim of the present work was to obtain scaffolds using four porogen agents and to evaluate the effects that a change in treatment temperature can have on their crystallinity. Scaffolds of sol-gel bioactive glass 100S (100\% SiO2) using as porogen agents paraffin 1, paraffin 2, wax and CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) were synthesized and characterized. As the best results were obtained with paraffin 1, scaffolds 58S (60\%SiO2-36\%CaO-4\%P2O5) and 100S using paraffin 1 as porogen agent were prepared. The scaffolds were submitted to different treatment temperatures to evaluate the effect on their crystallinity. Pore structure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Scaffolds presented satisfactory pore size and pore size distribution, important characteristics for scaffolds because they allow cell migration, nutrient transport, vascularization and tissue ingrowth. X-ray powder diffraction showed the amorphous nature of the scaffolds. At 900 °C, scaffolds BG 58S and 100S showed a small increase in crystallinity. BET analysis (N2-adsorption) indicated a mesoporous structure. The specific surface area varied from 73.2 m2/g for scaffold 58S treated at 800 °C to 331.2 m2/g for scaffold 100S treated at 800 °C. The materials obtained showed no toxic effects by MTT cytotoxicity assays. Results showed that the development of scaffolds is possible using porogen agents, with 3D interconnected porous structure and might therefore be a potential biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration.",

This study aimed to describe the attitude of physicians in relation to the this order and the need for its regulation. A questionnaire was applied to 80 physicians in the medical bureau of the Regional Council of Medicine of Joacaba/SC, Brazil. It was found that 90\% of the respondents knew the meaning of do-not-resuscitate, 86.2\% agreed to respect it, 91.2\% considered it important to be registered in medical records and 92.5\% understood as opportune the issuance of a regulation in this regard. It was concluded that most doctors knew about the do-not-resuscitate order, agreed to respect it, valued its registration in medical records and wanted its regulation by the relevant bodies.",

The studied material points to a medical science identity capable of unveiling the enigma of insanity and crime, providing answers when the two phenomena occur simultaneously in the court. Therefore, allegedly holder of this capability, medicine has an important role in the juridical process regarding the insane offender, being responsible for determining the accountability and the ceasing of dangerousness, resembling, in certain measure, Athena's binding vote in Orestes´ trial.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Surgical wound complications after sternotomy in cardiovascular procedures include small dehiscences, mediastinitis, and sternal osteomyelitis. Mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis are high-risk complications associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and recurrence. Treatment of the most severe cases involves prolonged hospitalization. Moreover, the long-term use of antibiotics during hospitalization and after discharge significantly increases the overall cost of treatment. A recent treatment option involves extensive surgical debridement of the surgical wound, treatment of the wound bed with negative pressure therapy, and closure of the wound with myocutaneous or fasciocutaneous flaps. The advantages of this strategy include improvement of the patient's quality of life, less manipulation and less discomfort for the patient, less burden on staff involved in care, lower rate of infection recurrence, and an overall reduction of treatment morbidity. Methods: The objective of this study was to conduct a retrospective survey of patients with surgical wound complications who were treated according to a protocol developed and improved by the Heart Institute of the Clinic Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (Instituto do Coração do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo-InCor/HC-FM-USP), and who underwent surgery by the same plastic surgeon. The epidemiological profiles and possible indicators of worse prognosis were determined from routine examinations performed on these patients. The medical records of patients treated at InCor/HC-FM-USP who presented with sternotomy infection in 2014 were assessed retrospectively. The analyzed variables included comorbidities, interval between surgical procedures, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, wound closure procedures, and treatment complications, among others. Results: The data are predominantly descriptive and epidemiological. At least one comorbidity was present in 84\% of cases. The mean number of surgical procedures per patient was 2.5, ranging from 1 to 7. The CRP levels decreased in 75\% of patients after the first surgical procedure, and the mortality rate was 17\%. Conclusion: The standardized method adopted significantly decreased the overall mortality and the rates of recurrence and readmission. Indicators of worse prognosis, including CRP levels and the leukogram, were identified at the time of diagnosis and initiation of the treatment protocol.",

However, despite this task's presence in the physician-patient context, it is rarely addressed during clinical training. The current study thus aimed to describe and evaluate how difficult news can be toned down during genetic counseling sessions involving cases of fetal syndromes and/or malformations. The study analyzed 33 naturalistic interactions (i.e. real situations), taped and transcribed, according to the theoretical and methodological perspective of Conversation Analysis, with an ethnomethodological basis. These interactions consisted of sessions in clinical genetics with pregnant women seen at the fetal medicine service of a reference hospital for maternal and child health in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). The analysis showed that communicating difficult news can be accompanied by optimistic perspectives that are scaled-up according to each situation's severity. In the absence of a positive diagnosis, the appointments can conclude with positive aspects such as recommendations for palliative care, so that the patient always leaves the appointment with some kind of recommendation. This study proposes to innovate and expand the scope of studies on communicating difficult news in the physician-patient relationship in Brazil, precisely by developing an analysis of real interactions in genetic counseling and thus providing interactional backing for training health professionals that deal with this challenge in their routine work.",

Application of DCE involved (i) a qualitative stage to define the attributes and their respective levels to comprise the job scenarios, (ii) construction and application of the instrument, and (iii) analysis with application of multinomial logit with conditional probability to estimate the weight of attributes and to construct scenarios for choice probability. The results indicate that the job attribute that most impacted students' choice was location, followed by job conditions, pay, access to medical residency, type of employment relationship, and workload. Students from private medical schools, with higher family income, and females were generally more likely to resist job assignments in unsafe urban areas and remote areas of the countryside. The job scenarios that proved most plausible in terms of public intervention were those that combined middle-level wages, good working conditions, and 10 to 20 bonus points on medical residency exams.",

Three 6-month-old male dogs were used. Approximately 3.0 cm3 of adipose tissue and 3.0 mL of bone marrow were collected. The samples were processed and the isolated cells were cultured in DMEM. The cells were subjected to phenotypic characterization and to osteogenic, adipogenic, and condrogenic differentiation to confirm the isolation of the MSC. The cells showed elongated and fusiform morphology and they were able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Phenotypic characterization revealed high expression of the MSC markers CD90(80.04\%) and CD29(96\%) in the cells from bone marrow and high expression of CD90(60.94\%) and CD29(77.08\%) in the cells from adipose tissue. In addition, phenotypic characterization revealed low expression of hematopoietic markers CD45(1.45\%) and CD34(1.53\%) in the cells from bone marrow and low expression of CD45(1.45\%) and CD34(1.53\%) in the cells from adipose tissue. Based on these results, the modifications applied to classical protocols simplified the process and proved to be efficient in the isolation, culture, and expansion of MSC isolated from the bone marrow and adipose tissue of dogs.",

In order to better understand the social and political context of the historical processes that generated this anachronism, I begin with a summary of the biography and thinking of Georges Cabanis, introducing him as a central character in his historical context. Next, I highlight the main structural elements in the Cabanis model, with a special focus on medical teaching, drawing on some of his writings as the documental source.

Here, we argue about the importance of quaternary prevention in specific primary and secondary prevention. The recent great development of preventive medicine, biomedicalization of risks and their treatment as if they were diseases, and the powerful influence of the commercial interests of pharmaceutical industries on the production of medical-sanitary knowledge alter classifications, create diseases and pre-diseases, lower cutoff points, and erase the distinction between prevention and healing. This situation converts larger amounts of asymptomatic persons into sick individuals and diverts clinical attention and resources from sick persons to the healthy, from older adults to young persons, and from the poor to the rich. Quaternary prevention facilitates and induces the development and systematization of operational knowledge and guidelines to contain hypermedicalization and the damages of preventive actions in professional care, especially in primary health care.",

Food consumption data was obtained from two 24-hour food recalls, and habitual consumption and prevalence rates of inadequate consumption of calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, C, D, and E were estimated according to the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council guidelines. General obesity was defined based on the body mass index (BMI) values and abdominal obesity was based on waist circumference (WC) values. For most of the micronutrients investigated (calcium and vitamins A, C, D, and E), consumption levels were below the recommendations, with high prevalence of inadequate consumption in the sample as a whole. Only inadequate vitamin C intake was higher among obese individuals (general or abdominal).

 abstract = "The Primary Care Professional Valorization Program (Provab) and the More Doctors Program are different strategies that were adopted simultaneously by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to tackle the lack of primary care physicians in the Brazilian National Health System (SUS), and they have the converging objective of recruiting Brazilians to work in vulnerable areas around the country. This paper analyzes the profiles and motivations of Provab professionals who migrated to the More Doctors Program in 2016. Secondary data from a Provab monitoring survey carried out by the Ministry of Health were used. The results showed that Provab attracted recently graduated physicians and suggest that the 10\% bonus offered to graduates is making Provab a viable alternative to accessing the More Doctors Program for inexperienced physicians who have not yet chosen their career paths, but who are increasingly enthusiastic with regard to primary care.",

Method: a qualitative method based on the theory of social representations was used. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with 20 health workers and by participant observation. The interviews were analyzed with ALCESTE software, which conducts a lexical content analysis using quantitative techniques for the treatment of textual data. Results: there were disagreements in the health care concepts and practices between traditional medicine and biomedicine; however, some progress has been achieved in the area of intermedicality. The ethnic boundaries established between health workers and indigenous peoples based on their representations of culture and family, together with the lack of infrastructure and organization of health actions, are perceived as factors that hinder health care in an intercultural context. Conclusion: a new basis for the process of indigenous health care needs to be established by understanding the needs identified and by agreement among individuals, groups, and health professionals via intercultural exchange.",

A qualitative study drew on institutional data, indexed articles, and case studies in selected Brazilian cities: Campinas (São Paulo State), Florianópolis (Santa Catarina State), Recife (Pernambuco State), Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. The analysis adopted the perspective of inclusion of Traditional and Complementary Medicine in the healthcare network and its integration with primary healthcare, based on the following dimensions: presence of Traditional and Complementary Medicine on the municipal agenda; position in the services; mode of access to Traditional and Complementary Medicine; Traditional and Complementary Medicine practitioners; types of practices; demand profile; and potential for expansion in the SUS. The authors identified and characterized four types of inclusion and integration of Traditional and Complementary Medicine, whether in association or not: Type 1 - in primary healthcare via professionals from the family health teams - Integrated; Type 2 - in primary healthcare via professionals with full-time employment - Juxtaposed; Type 3 - in primary healthcare via matrix-organized teams - Matrix Organization; Type 4 - in specialized services - Without Integration. The combination of types 1 and 3 was considered a potential guideline for the expansion of Traditional and Complementary Medicine in the SUS and can orient the growth and integration of Traditional and Complementary Medicine with primary healthcare. The growing presence of Traditional and Complementary Medicine in the SUS requires conceiving its strategic expansion, while existing experiences should not be wasted.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objectives To demonstrate the advantages of using simulator mannequins in practical medical education and particularly in pediatrics, studying the different kinds of existing mannequins/models, their specific characteristics and uses. Methods Medical training based on the theoretical transmission of knowledge and clinical learning practiced on real patients is currently unviable because it is dependent on the timing and availability of patients at any given moment. Nowadays, medicine uses medical simulation models, thus facilitating the development of proficiency in skills required for the execution of particular procedures. Medical simulation provides several advantages: it does not require real and available patients, techniques may be repeated in order to address errors, students' confidence in their abilities is promoted, and there is an absence of risk for the patient. Since 2009, the child health internship undertaken as part of the pediatric education section of the Integrated Master's degree at the University of Coimbra Faculty of Medicine by sixth-year students has included practical classes with models where students practice techniques such as pediatric intubation, the Ortolani maneuver, venipuncture in upper limbs, lumbar puncture, endotracheal intubation, breath sounds auscultation, venipuncture, evaluation of normotensive fontanelle, and hypertension fontanelle. This practical component stimulates and appeals to students, who repeatedly select these classes as one of their favorites on the child health internship completed as part of the Integrated Master's degree in Medicine. Results Students used medical simulation models to acquire knowledge and practice medical, invasive and non-invasive techniques such as: pediatric intubation, the Ortolani maneuver, venipuncture in the upper limbs, lumbar puncture, endotracheal intubation, breath sounds auscultation, venipuncture, evaluation of normotensive fontanelle, and hypertension fontanelle. Upon the students' assessment by means of a preference questionnaire, it became clear that these classes were some of those preferred by sixth-year students completing the child health internship as part of their Integrated Master's degree. Conclusions Students completing child health internships as part of the Integrated Master's degree in medicine were able to develop skills in performing medical procedures, with very positive assessments given by these students on the experience.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The teaching of acupuncture is not yet provided by the majority of medical schools in Brazil, despite its recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the fact that it gained recognition as a medical specialization by the National Medical Council in 1995. Acupuncture is also increasingly offered by the Brazilian Unified Health System (UHS), particularly since the implementation of National Politics on Complementary and Integrative Practices (2006), with its usage among both health professionals and patients on the rise. This study aims to analyze awareness, interest and experience in acupuncture among medical students from a southeastern Brazilian medical school. By means of a prospective and descriptive study held from August 2011 to July 2012, questionnaires containing seventeen questions on acupuncture awareness, interest and usage were distributed to 458 students ranging from first to sixth year. The awareness of acupuncture declared by the students was little to none, with students who did profess an awareness of the discipline mostly informed by means of free self-study. The research demonstrated that there is strong interest among students to learn about acupuncture and to include it on the medical curriculum, with it currently an optional subject chosen by the majority of students. The majority of students interviewed had been treated with acupuncture themselves and/or had relatives that had been treated with it, with favorable results. In terms of acceptance, the majority of students would not only accept acupuncture treatment, but would also encourage it. In conclusion, medical students demonstrated both an interest in and unfamiliarity with acupuncture. The implementation of the discipline as a subject on the medical curriculum would receive support among students and prove essential to placing them into contact with this specialization, thus contributing to a much needed update to the curriculum taught in Brazilian medical schools.",

Objective To verify whether the results of the progress test can be used as an indicator to improve the degree course in medicine. Methods We performed three cross-sectional studies of institutional households during the three years of the application of the test in the medical school at the University of Extremo Sul Catarinense (Unesc), South Brazil. All participants in the study were undergraduate students in medicine at the Unesc who had taken the progress test in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Statistical analysis was performed with a 95\% confidence level. Results Mean adherence over the three years ranged from 91.8\% to 100\%. In 2011, the medical program at the Unesc ranked equal to or above the average for the eight Napisul II schools until the eighth stage and ranked below average in the fifth and sixth years. In 2012, the Unesc again was ranked in the average range until the seventh stage. In the eighth stage, the Unesc's ranking was significantly higher than the overall average, and thus, in the fifth year, the school was on par with the group average. However, in the sixth year, the school's ranking was significantly below average. In 2013, Unesc was again ranked in the middle of the group until the eighth phase, and in the last three phases, the school was ranked above average. Conclusion The progress test is an excellent indicator for managers, as it can be used to develop interventions to improve the quality of the courses. After the first test was administered and changes in the school's courses were implemented, subsequent tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the changes.",

However, studies into medical teaching in the Family Health Strategy (FHS) have shown inadequacies in the quality, training and time spent by the tutors with students. In the municipality of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), the expansion of the FHS was belated, resulting in a vacuum of medical students being inserted into the network. Objective To understand the perception of Family Health Strategy physician preceptors regarding their performance with medical student interns from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Methods This is a case study which employed a qualitative method and took place in the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Semi-structured interviews were conducted between September 2011 and March 2012, with 15 preceptors from six Family Clinics receiving UFRJ medical interns. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, read and subjected to thematic content analysis, resulting in the establishment of five categories: encouragement and motivation; appreciation; training; real world versus academic world; teaching-service integration. Results The preceptors report that they feel recognized and encouraged by the students, but do not feel appreciated by the service coordinators, who fail to allocate adequate space and time to their preceptorship activities. A good relationship is established with both tutors and students. The preceptors would like to be trained in preceptorship and to strengthen their ties to UFRJ. They view their time with the students as both precious and challenging, because it stimulates them to rethink their care practices. They recognize in the internship the opportunity for students to gain practical experience of what has been learned in theory. Conclusion The preceptors' work is supported by the good relationship established between preceptors, tutors and students but efforts are needed to value the professionals who perform this practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The promotion of sexual health is of daily importance to the medical agenda, which is why debate over the inclusion of sexuality in the curricula of medical schools is a current theme in world literature on medical education. This report shares a health education initiative aimed toward integrating sexuality and gender issues in medical education, with the initiative carried out by means of extension courses offered to medicine undergraduate students in Piauí state, Brazil. Distributed in 10 modules, the 40-hour courses were titled ``Theoretical-Practical Sexuality'' and ``Sexualities in Cinema (Cinesex)'', providing 105 vacancies across two different methodological modalities. The courses aimed at improving the students' knowledge of the biopsychosocial dimension of sexuality, encouraging a change in attitudes toward subjects related to sex and gender, and the development of skills in sexual health. The Cinesex course saw movies with themes on sex and/or gender screened to a group of 80 students with a central focus on the pedagogical practice of awareness and the mobilization of feelings, opinions, and experiences on sexuality and gender. The debate that followed the screenings allowed students to reflect on attitudes and skills related to sexual health. The Theoretical and Practical Course on Sexuality was made available to a group of 25 students and used the practice of increasing awareness, providing literature specific to the themes in each module in order to help deepen debate. The acquisition of skills in compiling a sexual history was also developed throughout the modules with this smaller group of students, while the pedagogical practices employed on both courses focused on the students' sensitization to sexual and gender issues through audiovisual resources, as well as their discussion of theoretical frameworks and clinical cases. The students' participation unveiled myths and prejudices related to sexuality as well as difficulties in discussing the matter. Student-centered approaches provided a favorable environment for the listening and addressing of queries, the acquisition of knowledge, and the development of skills.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Psychostimulants are substances with the capacity to heighten alertness and motivation, also featuring antidepressant proprieties improving mood and cognitive performance. For this reason, many students use these substances indiscriminately. The purpose of the study was to investigate the use of substances stimulating the central nervous system by medical students at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (Furg), Brazil, verifying the most commonly used substances, the reason for use, and the user's profile. Methods A quantitative, observational and cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 of Furg's medical students enrolled at the institution in the second semester of 2015. Data collection was conducted by means of a standardized and auto-fill questionnaire, featuring questions on demographics, behavior and stimulant use. Information about the consumption of caffeine, methylphenidate, modafinil, piracetam, energy drinks, amphetamines, and MDMA was collected, with the results analyzed by means of the Fisher's exact test on statistics program Stata 11.2. Results The prevalence of stimulant substance usage at some point in the students' lives was 57.5\% (95\% CI 50.9 to 64.4), with 51.3\% having started during college. Usage of psycho stimulants at the time of the research was 52.3\% (95\% CI 45.3 to 59.3), with 16.6\% of the students consuming more than one psycho stimulant substance. The most popular substances were energy drinks (38\%) and caffeine, consumed more than five times a week (27\%). The consumption of stimulants was higher among students in the earlier stages of the degree. The main reasons given by the students were to compensate for sleep deprivation (47.7\%) and to improve reasoning, attention, and/or memory (31.6\%). Perceived effects of the stimulant use saw 81.2\% reporting sleep reduction, 70.8\% concentration improvement, 58.0\% fatigue reduction, 56.1\% improved reasoning abilities, and 54.0\% heightened wellbeing. Conclusions Stimulant consumption among medical students was high. More than half of the students reported consuming psycho stimulants and one in three of them used them to improve cognitive performance. The use of these substances was considered effective by most of the users, which may hamper the fight against these substances.",

Methods Data was collected from a sample of 36 professionals enrolled in residency programs in pediatrics at the Medical School of São José do Rio Preto from September 2013 to February 2014, using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Uwes), featuring seventeen items for self assessment and three dimensions: vigor, dedication, and absorption, and an overall score for the construct. Results 91.67\% were female, the median age was 28 years (minimum: 25, maximum: 34), 86.11\% single, 33.33\% had a family income of 2-5 monthly wages and 44.44\% over 10 minimum wages, 88.89\% were satisfied with their work and 52.78\% were considering quitting the program. The engagement of the indexes ranged from 3.56 to 4.28. Dedication was high (4.28 ± 1.12), while Absorption, Vigor, and Engagement, were medium (3.58 ± 1.00, 3.56 ± 0.98 and 3.78 ± 0.96). Regarding the desire to withdraw from the program, both groups revealed average rates for Absorption and Vigor; while Dedication and Engagement rates were average among those to have considered quitting the program, and high among those who had never thought about quitting. In terms of satisfaction with the program, Dedication indexes were high for those happy on the residency and medium for those not satisfied (4.49 and 2.6). Absorption, Vigor, and Engagement rates were average for both groups – 3.66, 3.68, and 3.92 among satisfied residents and 2.95, 2.54, and 2.7 among those not satisfied, respectively. Conclusion Pediatrics residents at the Medical School of São José do Rio Preto revealed sound levels of engagement, particularly in terms of Dedication. A low percentage of professionals was revealed to have low engagement rates across all areas of the Uwes.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Education is a social pillar characterized by its nobility and complexity and has undergone a paradigmatic shift from the unilateral and vertical teaching model to a more dynamic one, facilitating an open dialogue between teachers and students. Contemporary medicine has experienced a similar period of change, creating a growing need to better prepare medical students for dealing with dilemmas and conflicts in the healthcare field. Literary fiction is a teaching tool that follows the line of the active methodology and allows for reflection, debate, and a confrontation of ideas. This study aimed to identify the benefits of using literature as part of the medical degree, with a particular focus on ``Blindness'' by José Saramago. To this end, we developed a descriptive study featuring qualitative analysis, involving participation of first-year medical students who have attended the Ethics and Bioethics course at the Bahía School of Medicine and Public Health. After reading Saramago's work, students answered a procedural evaluation of the said component. Four themes emerged upon our thematic analysis of student responses: observation of the world and professional practice by medical students; humanization of medical practice in the face of social invisibility; technocentric medical practice and humanization; and medical students' awareness of the importance of literature in their training. The diversity, richnes and verticality of the responses submitted suggest that the reading of ``Blindness'' contributed positively to the students' learning of ethical and bioethical principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice) and added to their personal and professional formation. As reading is an individual experience, however, there is no way to ensure that the contribution was of the same magnitude for all students.",

This study is a cross-sectional and analytical research that was conducted in a public school in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The instrument used for the data collection was a self-administered questionnaire. The data collected were presented in absolute and percentage values. For the analytical statistical treatment of the data, the level of significance was considered p <0.05. The outcome variables were: Experiences of ethical conflicts in interpersonal relations within the medical course and Ethical conduct in health care. The identification of the prevalence of ethical conflicts in the undergraduate program adopted the perspective of different interpersonal relations (academic-teaching, academic-academic, academic-employee, academic-patient, teacher-teacher, teacher-patient, teacher-employee and employee-patient). (Importance of identifying themselves to the health services user and requesting consent to perform the physical examination, assistance without the supervision of the teacher, issuance of health documents without the signature of the professional responsible and use of social networks to share data Of patient). It was verified the association of the outcome variables with sex, year of graduation and course evaluation. A total of 281 undergraduate students enrolled in all undergraduate courses in Medicine of both sexes, with a predominance of female (52.7\%). The students reported having experienced conflicting situations in interpersonal relations with teachers (59.6\%), provided assistance without proper supervision of a teacher (62.6\%), reported having issued health documents without the accompaniment of teachers (18, 5\%). The highest frequency was observed among those enrolled in the most advanced years of the undergraduate program (p <0.05). The use of social networks for the purpose of sharing patient data (25.1\%) was prevalent in the most advanced years of medical graduation and among those who evaluated the course as regular (p <0.05). It is concluded that undergraduate medical students experienced ethical conflicts during their medical training, with a prevalence of conflicts in the advanced years of the course. From this perspective, it is necessary to provide a space for discussion and collective reflection on the ethical problems experienced by students, during their graduation in Medicine, in order to build a professional ethical practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT As a specialization, Intensive Care (IC) is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified professionals with the specific IC title. This shortage is mainly due to a significant increase in the number of beds in intensive care units (ICU) in recent decades, with less than 2\% of physicians trained in this specialization in Brazil. The country's legislation calls for one daytime/routine doctor specialized in IC for every 10 beds per shift, whereas, according to the Brazilian Intensive Care Association, the State of Rondônia only has 183 ICU beds and 18 intensive care physicians. This framework puts the quality of the IC service at risk, particularly for users. The following study sought to characterize the educational profile of intensive care physicians working in intensive care units (ICU) in public and private hospitals in state of Rondônia. Completed by 93 professionals, this transversal and quantitative study featured a self-administered questionnaire containing questions on sociodemographic conditions and professional profiles. The results showed that the highest proportion were male and aged 30-40, with a monthly income over ten minimum monthly salaries. Approximately 1/3 reported working in two different places, and less than 20\% worked exclusively in ICU. Most of the participants worked in public and private ICU, and only 19.4\% were specialized in Intensive Care Medicine. Participation in scientific events was significant, but only 1 out of 5 took part in research projects, with only 1 out of 4 publishing scientific articles. The small number of experts working in ICU compromises the quality of care services provided to users. Efforts to correct this deficiency should be encouraged by increasing the vacancies offered on local residency programs, improving the quality of management, as well as providing better training for medical professionals working in ICU.",

Aims To determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their risk factors, and the use of antidepressants among medical students. Methods Participants answered the Beck's Inventory (BDI) for detecting depressive symptoms and the Morisky-Green-Levine test to evaluate medication adherence. A one-tailed Fisher's exact test was performed on qualitative variables, with a one-way Anova test performed on quantitative variables with post-hoc analysis by means of Tukey-Kramer's test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results Associations between depressive disorders and the following factors were considered statistically significant: frequency of leisure activities, stress, satisfaction with academic performance, and lack of emotional support. Gender, living alone, steady partner, use of alcohol, smoking tobacco, use of illicit drugs, and Medical school's grade did not show association with depressive disorders. Satisfaction with academic performance and high level of stress were not statistically significant when they were correlated to Medical school's grade. Conclusion The prevalence of depression and also use of antidepressants is similar to the results recorded by other studies on medical students performed by Brazilian and international institutions. The following items were considered to be risk factors on the development of depressive disorders: frequency of leisure activities, stress, satisfaction with academic performance, and lack of emotional support in the academic environment. From the fourth grade to the sixth grade, the prevalence of depression seemed to increase and just the sixth grade was statistically significant when compared to other grades through averages of BDI score. It suggests the hypothesis that the end of Medical course is the period of time where there are more stressful and depressive factors for the student.",

In view of this, the October Rosa mobilization aims at drawing the population's attention regarding this neoplasm in women from all over the world, so that their common objective is to perform the early diagnosis in order to reduce mortality due to this neoplasm. Thus, the following article describes the experiences of undergraduate medical students at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (Uesc) regarding the practice module on Integrated Teaching with Community Health and Service, as part of a joint initiative with a Family Health Team in the outskirts of Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil, within the context of the ``Pink October'' movement, also aiming to share thoughts on the medical degree raised by the group on the experience described. As part of the Pink October initiative, the students were given the opportunity to take a clinical approach in the waiting room, collecting information and performing physical examinations on patients who appear at the Family Health Unit. This experience was not only intended to identify patients with suspected cancer and measure the data collected, but was also designed to provide the students the opportunity to put their health education and communication skills into practice, developing the doctor-patient relationship. It also allows academics to better recognize and understand users' difficulties in preventing and promoting breast health. In this context, it was observed that several women were not familiar with the recommended techniques for the breast self-exam (???). Medical students must understand that practical and theoretical knowledge is reconstructed with every single patient according to their specific historical context and varying viewpoints and interpretations of the concepts of health and disease. In addition, the medical professional must exercise, from the undergraduate, skills that extrapolate the orthodox medical work, also assuming a position of multiplier of citizenship, a propagating agent of rights and duties.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Clinical reasoning strategies (CR) employ hypothetical-deductive and inductive models as their theoretical basis. The first is based on the generation of hypotheses derived from a knowledge of pathologies and the second on a generalization derived from data on the case or an identification of a pattern. Doctors' or students' thoughts may be evaluated by the ``think aloud'' technique (TAT). Objectives To identify the CR strategies used by medical students at the end of the basic cycle, as well as the organization and contents of their knowledge, analyzing an internal medicine prototype clinical case by means of the TAT. Method A qualitative study was conducted on undergraduate medical students at the end of the basic cycle in a Brazilian university in 2014. The theory of prototypes served as the basis for building the clinical case, based on 41 students' perceptions of signs, symptoms, syndromes, and diseases typical of internal medicine. The TAT was individually applied to 30 randomly selected students in the original sample, in order to obtain an audio record of the verbalization of their reasoning processes in light of the case presented. A transcript of the speeches allowed us to evaluate the texts by means of content analysis, and to categorize the reasoning techniques employed. Semantic axes were also identified and subsequently categorized into six classes: symptoms, signs, syndromes, diseases, factual data, and processes. Results A total of 105 diagnostic hypotheses were created, in which 12 different types were identified as primary and 12 as secondary, with a mean of 3.5 principal hypotheses per student. The most commonly used reasoning style for developing the PDH was scheme-inductive (SI) = 42.3\%, followed by pattern recognition (PR) = 21.2\%, mixed SI (15.4\%), mixed PR (10.6\%), and hypothetic-deductive (10.6\%). As for knowledge organization and content, a mean of 12.9 semantic axes was recorded per student, with 20.9 interpretation processes per student and 6.8 combination processes per student. Conclusions The inductive reasoning strategy is the most commonly used for developing PDHs among medical students at the end of the basic cycle. Students revealed a solid semantic network and skills in interpretation processes; however their combined abilities were limited when compared to those of experienced doctors.",

Healthcare professionals often participate in initiatives integrating teaching and service as preceptors. In 2001, Unicamp Medical School reformulated its curriculum to adopt an extended approach to learning scenarios, taking their students into the environment in which their users reside and working in the aim of promoting health. In 2004, the discipline entitled ``Comprehensive Healthcare'' was introduced in partnership with the municipality of Campinas (SP), in order that physicians in the field of pediatrics, general practice, and gynecology working in basic healthcare units (BHU) could use four of their scheduled hours to supervise students in the seventh and eighth semesters of medical school completing preceptorships, in a joint initiative with university professors. The objective of this study was to assess the satisfaction of users served in BHUs by physicians acting as preceptors and to determine if the professionals linked the preceptorship to their qualifying as professionals. Of a total of 22 preceptors, 20 submitted to a semi-structured interview, with one of the questions asking if the preceptorship helped conceptualize the service offered to the users in the BHUs in which they were acting as physicians. Users were interviewed by means of a close-ended questionnaire using emoticons to classify the preceptor on factors including quality of medical care, appreciation of the complaint made, duration of the consultation, resolution rate, trust and adherence to orientation, and general perception of the care received. Over 90\% of users rated the care positively, with 80\% of the physicians interviewed regarding the preceptorship as contributing to their qualifying as professionals.",

In Brazil, the Programa Mais Médicos (More Doctors Program – PMM) was created by the federal government in 2013 in order to reduce the shortage of doctors, address regional inequalities in healthcare access and improve medical education, expanding doctors' training in fields where they can better understand the reality of the population's health. Considering that students in the healthcare field are directly involved with the proposals and outcomes of this program, the objective of this study was to evaluate student knowledge and positioning and also that of their teachers on the PMM. A questionnaire was therefore administered to 106 students and 53 professors at a private medical and dentistry school. The hit rate for the 25 questions on the PMM's objectives and proposals ranged from 38.4\% to 50.6\%.The majority recognized the PMM's aim to reduce the shortage of doctors and improve public policies related to healthcare. The PMM's aim to improve medical training, increasing the availability of medical courses and medical residencies, proved, however, to be unknown to over 60\% of respondents. The hiring of foreign doctors was mistakenly considered not only to be the objective of the program, but also part of the initiatives designed to achieve the program objectives. The conclusion reached is that although university health sciences students and professors serve as important actors in the strategy for achieving the PMM's goals, they have limited knowledge on the program, particularly in terms of the initiatives related to medical curricula and medical residencies. Discussion on the program could be introduced to medical courses in order to address this situation and improve the program's outcomes.",

 abstract = "Abstract Based on a review of the literature published in the early twenty-first century by Brazilian researchers, the article offers an overview of stem cell research in Brazil. Three central topics were detected in these papers: (1) the funding of stem cell research in Brazil; (2) preclinical and clinical trials in Brazil; and (3) social anthropological analysis focused on ethical and legal matters. Our review identifies controversial questions in the construction of this scientific field, especially issues involving the media as a disseminator of values and of certain social representations, where new kinds of hope figure large. Within this climate of uncertainty, we find patients and their families energized by the promises of the ``medicine of the future.''",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis is a debilitating infecto-contagious disease, caused by an acid-fast bacillus (AFB) that belong to different species of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). Mycobacteriosis are important diseases in veterinary medicine because of their zoonotic potential and worldwide distribution, affecting all classes of vertebrates. In wild animals the mycobacteriosis have been reported mainly as a problem in captivity. There are also reports in free-ranging wildlife, endangering and hampering tuberculosis erradication programs in animal production. The diagnosis of the disease in wildlife is usually postmortem, because the tuberculin test is not standardized for wildlife species, and also it is not reliable for screening. The postmortem diagnosis is based on macroscopic findings, microscopic detection of AFB at Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN), and mainly isolation and identification of the agent. However, only gross and microscopic exams do not allow to distinguish the species of Mycobacterium involved. The immunostaining with polyclonal anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis confirms tuberculosis infection, but is not specific; there may be marking of other mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to describe the histologic findings, of ZN staining and immunohistochemistry technique (IHC) of 13 cases of wildlife herbivores diagnosed with tuberculosis in the Setor de Patologia Veterinária of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (SPV-UFRGS) during the 2003- 2015 period. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues were recut, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and ZN, and samples were submitted to the IHC (anti-M. tuberculosis marking, streptavidin-biotin peroxidase method). All animals included were adults living in captivity and belonged to the following species: llama (5/13), sambar deer (4/13), camel (1/13), red deer (1/13), Brazilian tapir (1/13) and Nilgai antelope (1/13). The IHC revealed immunostaining of accentuated (4/13), moderate (4/13) and discrete (4/13) intensity, except in a case with insufficient material. The histological features, findings in ZN staining and IHC in the wild herbivores with tuberculosis lesions allowed the diagnosis of infection with Mycobacterium sp., turning into fast and efficient methods of diagnosis, which can help to prevent the spread of this disease in animals from the same herd.",

Therefore, the orthopedist commonly deal with irreducible comminuted fractures of long bones, bone tumors or non-unions, which require repairers surgical procedures, through the segment replacement or bone defect filling with biomaterials. The aim of this research is to evaluate and compare the mechanical strength of natural, synthetic and mixed biomaterials. Seven experimental groups of six test samples each were used: Group 1 rabbit cortical bone (BONE - control); Group 2, bone cement (CO); Group 3, bone cement autoclaved (COA); Group 4, bone cement and dog cortical bone macrofragment (COMaFO); Group 5, bone cement and bone autoclaved macrofragment dog cortical (COMaFOA); Group 6, bone cement and dog cortical bone microfragment (COMIFO) and Group 7, bone cement and dog cortical bone microfragment (COMiFOA). The specimens were subjected to axial compression mechanical tests controlled universal testing machine EMIC®. The test was stopped when there was sharp decline in the graph curve indicating failure of the sample. In relation to the maximum force, the COA groups COMaFOA and COMiFOA not statistically different from the control group (BONE; p> 0.01). Already the CO groups, COMaFO and COMIFO difeririram statistically the control group (BONE; p 0.01). Already the CO groups, COA, COMaFO and COMIFO differed significantly from the control group (BONE; p0.01). Already the CO groups, COA and COMiFOA differed significantly from the control group (BONE; p<0.01). It is concluded that only COMaFOA and COMiFOA groups showed very similar mechanical properties to the control group (BONE). Therefore, due to these characteristics, these two biomaterials (COMaFOA e COMiFOA) would be the most suitable as a substitute in the repair of bone defects.",

Among such assessments, the study of the coronary fractional flow reserve (FFR) has become the most widely used. Objective: To evaluate the correlation between FFR and findings of ischemia obtained by noninvasive methods including stress echocardiography and nuclear medicine and the presence of critical coronary artery obstruction. Methods: Retrospective study of cases treated with systematized and standardized procedures for coronary disease between March 2011 and August 2014. We included 96 patients with 107 critical coronary obstructions (> 50\% in the coronary trunk and/or ≥ 70\% in other segments) estimated by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS). All cases presented ischemia in one of the noninvasive studies. Results: All 96 patients presented ischemia (100\%) in one of the functional tests. On FFR study with adenosine 140 g/kg/min, 52\% of the cases had values ≤ 0.80. On correlation analysis for FFR ≤ 0.80, the evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and ROC curve in relation to the stenosis degree and length, and presence of ischemia, no significant values or strong correlation were observed. Conclusion: Coronary FFR using a cut-off value of 0.80 showed no correlation with noninvasive ischemia tests in patients with severe coronary artery obstructions on QCA and ICUS.",

 abstract = "Abstract Objective: To map the different methods for diagnostic imaging instruction at medical schools in Brazil. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was sent to each of the coordinators of 178 Brazilian medical schools. The following characteristics were assessed: teaching model; total course hours; infrastructure; numbers of students and professionals involved; themes addressed; diagnostic imaging modalities covered; and education policies related to diagnostic imaging. Results: Of the 178 questionnaires sent, 45 (25.3\%) were completed and returned. Of those 45 responses, 17 (37.8\%) were from public medical schools, whereas 28 (62.2\%) were from private medical schools. Among the 45 medical schools evaluated, the method of diagnostic imaging instruction was modular at 21 (46.7\%), classic (independent discipline) at 13 (28.9\%), hybrid (classical and modular) at 9 (20.0\%), and none of the preceding at 3 (6.7\%). Diagnostic imaging is part of the formal curriculum at 36 (80.0\%) of the schools, an elective course at 3 (6.7\%), and included within another modality at 6 (13.3\%). Professors involved in diagnostic imaging teaching are radiologists at 43 (95.5\%) of the institutions. Conclusion: The survey showed that medical courses in Brazil tend to offer diagnostic imaging instruction in courses that include other content and at different time points during the course. Radiologists are extensively involved in undergraduate medical education, regardless of the teaching methodology employed at the institution.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the electrocardiographic pattern of Wistar rats at various stages of growth, in order for the results to contribute as a standard reference. Rattus norvegicus albinus rats of the Wistar lineage were used. The rats were divided into 5 experimental groups being defined according to age and named as follows: group 21 days (21D), 2 months (2M), 3 months (3M), 7 months (7M) and 18 months (18M), where n = 20 per group. For the realization of ECG, electrodes connected to the electrocardiograph channels were positioned in animals to capture the electrical signal of the heart in 6-lead. The data were grouped and subjected to comparison by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, P=0.05. The results showed that, overall, the modulations along the front aging process, related to the ECG, are initiated from 2M period, apparent stability by 3M and/or 7M, followed by exacerbation of modulations in 7M and/or 18M, depending on the electrocardiographic variable in question. Front of heart rate (HR), concomitantly, there is a similar pattern, that is, decreasing from 2M period with stability until 7M, followed by more pronounced decrease in 18M. The results suggest that due to the aging process, the heart of Wistar rats shows changes in the conduction of electrical stimulation and reduction in heart rate, factors that deserve attention as indicators of inclusion / exclusion of animals in experimental groups by researchers using that species as a model.",

Comparing the inoculum for A (ml / gDM), LRB, and CS, they showed similar values, differing only for TF. The lag time (L) between inoculum, the CSC and CSF had the lowest colonization times when the meal was BAS. With M10 and M20 substrates, the LRB inoculum showed the lowest time, CSF had the longest time and CSC did not differ from both. There was no significant difference between the inoculum for TF substrate. The gas production technique used for the ceca of pigs showed similar results to those for ruminants.

Grazing intensity was found to modify the composition of morphological components and the forage mass accumulated by peanuts; however, the leaf area index in pre-grazing remained constant. Perennial peanut should not be used under intensive grazing. Grazing intensity from moderate to very lenient provides greater mass of pre-grazing forage and total accumulated forage, combined with shorter intervals between grazing.",

The addition of different sources of fat, glycine and taurine supplementation on transition diets did not influence productive performance from 1 to 21 days. Supplementation of diets with glycine and taurine altered the morphology of the intestinal mucosa, mainly of the duodenum, resulting in greater length of villi and villi: crypt ratio.

The work was conducted at the Animal Unit of Digestive and Metabolic Studies belonging to the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinárias-FCAV/Unesp campus Jaboticabal. Six animals fitted with rumen cannulas Nellore were used to verify the parameters pH, ammonia nitrogen, digestibility, and microbial mass distributed in a 6x6 Latin square. Six diets with similar metabolizable energy and crude protein were formulated using the forage:concentrate ratio of 30:70. The roughage used was corn silage. The concentrates used were composed of corn, soybean hulls, sunflower meal, glycerin and urea. The treatments were: C = control, U = 1 \% urea, G10 = 10 \% glycerin, GU10 = 1 \% urea and 10 \% glycerol, G20 = 20 \% glycerin and GU20 = 20 \% glycerin and 1 \% urea. Diets with glycerin had lower digestibility of NDF and hemicellulose. There was no influence of diets on the growth of rumen microorganisms, pH and ammonia nitrogen. Diets with 20 \% glycerin in the diet dry matter decrease the population of rumen protozoa. The addition of glycerol decreases the digestibility of fibrous components of the diet.",

The protocol consisted of fifteen daily fractions of 300 cGy each. The equipment used was an orthovoltage unit. The tumor had complete clinical remission after the fourth session, and mild mucositis was the only side effect observed. Systemic chemotherapy was performed with vinblastine and lomustine, alternated every 14 days, during four months. There is no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis in this patient twenty-two months after treatment. The combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be considered as an alternative therapy in cases of unresectable mast cell tumors. It led to complete and durable remission of an aggressive tumor, with great quality of life.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The caprine arthritis encephalitis is a virosis with worldwide distribution in livestock and in the mammary form chronic mastitis is prevalent, which can cause assimetric and hardening of the udder, known as indurative chronic mastitis leading to reduction in milk production. The ultrasound is a good method of assessing the mammary gland, because the technique is non-invasive, fast, and easy to apply. This study aimed to evaluate the ultrasonographic features (grayscale, echogenicity, and homogeneity) of mammary parenchyma of 20 seroreacting goats and 20 not seroreacting for caprine arthritis encephalitis virus. It was observed that the average diameter of retromammary lymph nodes of seroreacting animals (0.72cm) to caprine arthritis encephalitis virus was smaller (P= 0.02) than in non seroreacting animals (0.93cm). In analysis between the portions of the udder, the grayscale values of the distal third of the caudal portion of the mammary parenchyma was higher in seroreacting animals (P0.05), displaying mostly heterogeneous and hypoechoic standards. From the results, this study points to evidence that the caprine arthritis encephalitis can cause changes in grayscale measurable by ultrasound, and this can be used as an efficient and non-invasive helper method for monitoring and early detection of indurative mastitis.",

Twenty-two to 42 day-old quails were used, distributed in three and five treatments in the first and second generation, respectively. At the end, the birds were killed by cervical dislocation, and their liver and chest muscle were collected for total RNA extraction. The cDNA was amplified using specific primers for the genes analyzed. The results showed that the expression of GHR gene and IGF-I were influenced by the supplementation. In the fifth treatment, where only the first generation received supplementation above the standard requirements for the period, there was a significantly higher expression of GHR both in muscle chest and in the liver, and also IGF-I on muscle, leading to the conclusion that the excess dietary methionine becomes toxic to birds. Despite the gene´s expression seeming to be influenced by the addition of methionine levels in the study, there was no difference in feed intake, feed conversion and weight of the birds.",

Water and feed intake, pH, total nitrogen, and moisture of excreta were evaluated. The inclusion of 0.5\% of natural zeolites in the diet did not change (P>0.05) the water and feed intake and total nitrogen of excreta, nevertheless, it decreased (P<0.05) the pH and moisture of excreta.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Fibrinolytic proteases are able to degrade fibrin clot formed in the blood vessel, avoiding intravascular thrombosis. In animals, thrombophlebitis often affects horses, and in severe cases causes obstruction of the jugular and laryngeal edema leading to airway obstruction allowing cerebral edema resulting in the death of the animal. Since treatment is costly, the investigation of other sources of fibrinolytic proteases at lower cost and with fewer side effects is needed. Thus, this study aims to produce and characterize fibrinolytic proteases from Streptomyces parvulus DPUA 1573. For enzyme production, a factorial design was performed to evaluate 24 soybean flour concentration (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5\%) and glucose (0, 0.5 and 1.0g/L), temperature (28, 32 and 37°C) and agitation (150, 200 and 250rpm) on biomass and fibrinolytic activity. Fibrinolytic protease showed maximum activity (835 U/mL) under these conditions: 1.5\% soybean flour, 1g/L glucose, 28°C, and 150rpm 48 hours of fermentation. The optimal temperature was 55°C and optimal pH was 9.0. Fibrinolytic protease activity was inhibited by EDTA, the ion Fe2+, and by SDS, which indicated that the enzyme is a metallo-protease. The strain Streptomyces parvulus DPUA 1573 was able to produce fibrinolytic protease with biochemical characteristics favorable for application in veterinary and human medicine.",

The sensitivities of breeding values to changes in threonine: lysine ratios (genotype x environment interaction) of diets were obtained by random regression models (reaction model) using the WOMBAT program using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood principle. Model considering two classes of residual variance showed the best goodness of fit. The Reaction Norms analyses indicated changes in the ranking of breeding values for both lines suggesting quails selected in one level of threonine: lysine ratio will not express all their genetic potential if fed different threonine: lysine ratio diets. This behavior indicates sensitivity of breeding values to changes in the nutrition characterizing the genotype by environment interaction. The prediction of breeding values must be performed using the same level of threonine: lysine ratio in diet the quails will be fed in the production system.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The placentitis is a major cause of premature birth, abortion and compromised foal delivery, and may result in hypoxia and sepsis. The blood gas analysis and hematology can provide important information for monitoring the foals born from mares with placentitis, with different degrees of maturity. The aim of this study was to describe the hematological and blood gas values during the first 24 hours of life in foals born from crossbreed mares with experimentally induced placentitis, presenting different degrees of maturity. Sixteen foals, born from mares with experimentally induced ascending placentitis were assigned to three groups according to degree of maturity: premature (n=8), dysmature (n=4), and full-term foals (n=4). Blood samples were collected at birth (0), at 12h and 24h, and hematological evaluation and blood gas variables were measured. In the premature group normocytic normochromic anemia was observed compared to dysmature group at 12h and 24h. The premature group showed lower count of white blood cells at 24h relative to the full-term group (p=0.01). The pH, cHCO3 and SO2 values do not differ among the groups; however the premature group showed respiratory acidosis (pH=7,28). The PCO2 was higher at 0h in the premature foals (p=0.02). In all groups, the PCO2 presented an adaptive curve with reduction between 12h and 24h. The premature foals showed lower base excess (BE) values at birth (p=0.02), confirming the respiratory acidosis in this group. We conclude that the hematological and blood gas response differs between foals with different degrees of maturity. Acidosis in the premature foals at birth, with stabilization and compensation of pH value during the first 12-24h demonstrate the necessity of sequential blood gas analysis in risk foals. This may help identify the clinical response to the process and assist in the establishment of adequate treatment and prognosis for these foals.",

Previous studies have investigated the practice of physical exercise as a possible factor to reduce these problems, but the results so far are inconclusive. Objective: To analyze the gait parameters, the prevalence of falls and the fear of falling in active and sedentary elderly women. Methods: Thirty-five women aged 60-75 years were divided in two groups: sedentary group (SG), who did not practice physical exercises regularly in the last year, and active group (AG) who practiced physical exercise in an extension project of a public university, for at least six months. The data referring to the spatio-temporal parameters of gait were collected using a 4.88m gait mat with pressure sensors. The elderly women walked on the carpet under two experimental conditions: preferred speed and highest possible speed. Three attempts were made randomly in each condition, totaling six attempts. The volunteers also answered two questionnaires: Baecke questionnaire, to assess the physical fitness, and Falls questionnaire to assess the incidence and consequences of falls. Results: Gait velocity, cadence, and stride length were significantly higher in the active elderly, while the time in double stance was significantly higher in the sedentary elderly in both conditions. Furthermore, the active elderly women had a lower prevalence of falls (22\%) and fear of falling (22\%) compared to sedentary women (58\% and 70\%, respectively). Conclusion: The regular practice of physical exercises in physical education programs for the elderly seems to be an effective strategy to minimize the effects of the aging process, the risk of falls and the fear of falling in elderly women.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality in the world population. In healthy populations, the estimated cardiovascular risk has been calculated from predictive models derived from prospective and observational studies. The Framingham score is an algorithm traditionally used as a primary strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic patients over a period of 10 years. Some risk factors are considered to determine this score such as serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking and age of patients. Objective: To evaluate if the practice of physical activity is an important variable capable of modulating cardiovascular risk obtained by the Framingham score. Methods: Data from 1004 individuals, divided into adults (18 to 59 years) and elderly (>60 years) were considered using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software for statistical analyses and the significance level was established at 5\% (P<0.05) for all tests applied. Results: The correlation between age, sex, smoking, hypertension and serum levels of HDL and the Framingham score was confirmed in both the adult and elderly group. Additionally, our analyses demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between the practice of physical activity and the risk calculated by this score, making it clear that adult or elderly individuals who practice moderate or intense physical activity have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that moderate or intense physical activity can modulate the Framingham score and, as well as the age, sex, smoking, hypertension and serum levels of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, should be considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.",

Objective: To verify the acute effect of intermittent exercises on blood glucose and oxidation of energetic substrates in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We evaluated 10 diabetic adolescents aged 10 to 15 years. Anthropometric measurements, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), VO2max, and the intermittent exercises test were evaluated. In this test, subjects continued pedaling for 30 minutes on a cycle ergometer with a load of 60\% of VO2max, interspersed with maximum intensity sprints of 10 seconds every 5 minutes. The energetic substrates were evaluated during the test and the capillary blood glucose was measured before, immediately after exercise, and 30 minutes later. We observed a mean reduction in blood glucose of 39.2 ± 41.92 mg/dl, that is, an average of 21.61\% of initial blood glucose. There was a significant difference (0.0001) between the oxidized energetic substrates, predominating the use of CHO. There is a strong direct correlation between HbA1c and the BMI z score (r = 0.821, p = 0.004) and between HbA1c and glucose observed post-exercise (r = 0.702, p = 0.024), and there is a strong correlation between pre-exercise and post-exercise glucose (r = 0.851, p = 0.002) and between post-exercise and 30 minutes after exercise (r = 0.874, p = 0.001). The linear regression test showed that BMI z score accounts for 67\% of the HbA1c values (r² = 0.675). Results: According to the results observed, 30 minutes of intermittent aerobic exercises interspersed with short sprints of 10 seconds promoted a mean reduction of 21\% in blood glucose with tendency to increase in the recovery phase. The predominant energetic substrates in the activity are carbohydrates (CHO). Conclusion: The better the adolescent BMI z score, the better glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes is expected.",

The knowledge about the influence of different recovery protocols on CAF after ST on treadmill with volunteers in standing position is scarce. Objective: To compare the vagal reactivation and the degree of global CAF modulation in two different recovery protocols, passive (PR) vs. active (AR) immediately after submaximal ST in treadmill. Methods: We evaluated 24 physically active males, aged (mean ± SD) 27.2 ± 4.4 years and BMI 24.8 ± 1.8 kg/m2. The order of the recovery protocol was set at random. The tests were performed in 7-day intervals. Both recovery protocols were performed in standing position for 5 minutes, immediately after ST. The time indices of heart rate variability were used to assess the vagal reactivation and the overall degree of CAF, rMSSD, and SDNN, respectively, in PR and AR. After analysis of the data distribution, the Mann-Whitney and Friedman tests with Dum post-hoc were used at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. Results: We observed a higher vagal reactivation at first minute of the PR compared to AR [4.1 (4.9-3.4) ms vs. 3.4 (4.0-2.9) ms, p = 0.03], and a higher degree of global CAF modulation from the third to the fifth minute and a tendency to significant difference in the second minute of PR compared to AR (p = 0.09−0.005). Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that minimum physical effort, such as walking slowly on a treadmill, decreased the vagal reactivation and the overall modulation degree of CAF after a submaximal ST in physically active men.",

Elastic bandage (EB) has been used in musculoskeletal disorders and can provide feedback to the muscles, enabling them to perceive and keep adequate postural alignment. No studies were found on the influence of elastic bandage use in PPT. Objective: To evaluate the effect of EB on the muscular activation on the tensor fasciae latae muscle in subjects with PPT. Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial in which the pelvis positioning of 20 men aged 18 to 28 years was evaluated The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, the bandage group (BG) in which the EB was applied tensioning the tensor fasciae latae muscle and the iliotibial tract, and the placebo group (PG), with the same material applied to subjects, but without tension, for a period of 72 hours. The groups were reassessed 30 minutes and 72 hours after the intervention. Results: There was a significant decrease in PPT in the BG (p = 0.002) compared to the PG (p = 0.146). The largest inclination reduction in the BG was observed in the immediate period compared to 72 hours later. Conclusion: The findings of this demonstrate that the EB technique can help the reduction of PPT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the muscle activation and the repercussions of the use of EB in subjects with PPT.",

The PHC reform in Rio de Janeiro created a demand for medical specialists working in networks, leading to the expansion of already established medical residency programs and the establishment of a new program sponsored by the Municipal Health Secretariat, providing new teaching positions in several health facilities within the municipal network. These three residency programs progressed through different paths to provide training to their preceptors, offering permanent courses and local actions seeking higher professional qualification and better balance between care and education responsibilities. Permanent investments to strengthen medical residency programs and preceptors training are essential to consolidate the PHC reform nationwide.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted, with independent random samples and 802 interviewees. Results indicate a better performance for children care when compared to adult care. Attributes ``access'' and ``comprehensiveness – available services'' were the worst performers, probably due to the great external and internal migration existing within Rocinha itself. To improve these attributes, we recommend the adoption of a single list of residents by Family Health Team (ESF), with a maximum number of people, including territorial delimitation and people internal mobility.

The analysis of the narratives implied three main categories: Search for new rationalities in health; Entering in the acupuncture universe; Acupuncture goes beyond the needle. It was observed that the search for acupuncture was motivated by dissatisfaction with the initial training into biomedical paradigm. The trajectory of the education in acupuncture was gradual and involved a deep insertion into TCM, due to the complexity of its treatment plan, which led the participants to realize that the needle insertion represents the confluence of several aspects of the rationality, which cannot be reduced to application of a technique.

In the course of Calculus 1 in which it was applied, there was an improvement in the approval rate from 50 to 95\%, however, the main result is the development of the human side of the participants. In this sense, this paper presents the students' perception with respect to the Three Hundred Method, considering dimensions such as nervousness and anxiety in tests, collaboration, solidarity, empathy, personal growth and freedom to learn.",

The Anisakis simplex is a more pathogenic Anisakidae to humans and is highly allergenic. However, other species of this family also have characteristics that are harmful to humans, but little is known about the immunogenicity this parasites. The objective of this study was to experimentally assess the immunogenic potential of the parasite Hysterothylacium deardorffoverestreetorum (H.D) in mice. Mice of inbred BALB/c strain were divided into three groups and received three immunizations of the following antigenic preparations obtained from L3 larvae H.D: Crude larval extract of H.D (CEH) Extract secreted / excreted larvae H.D. (ESH) and crude extract of larvae after excretion / secretion (EEH). Serum samples were obtained on different days after immunization to determine the levels of circulating specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results show increased production of immunoglobulin (Ig) G after the second immunization with a gradual increase after the third immunization. Regarding IgE reactivity, this occurred later, demonstrating a progressive increase only after the third immunization. Cellular immunity was evaluated by intradermal, and showed statistically significant result compared to the control used. This experiment is the first description of the pathogenic potential of this parasite in mammals and represents a breakthrough in the diagnosis of human Anisakidosis.",

Studies involving melanosis in multiple organs are rare. The aim of this paper is to describe a case of multicentric melanosis in a broiler resulting in animal condemnation at slaughter. Samples from diverse organs originating from a Cobb broiler, 48-49 days of age, were sent to Laboratório de Patologia Animal from Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo for histopathological avaliation. This animal was condemned in line inspection due to multifocal black areas of pigmentation. At microcopic avaliation, multifocal melanin in moderate-intense amount in all the organs stricken with macroscopic black lesions was noted. Sections of pigmented areas were negative for Prussian Blue and no neoplasic cells were found. Pigmentation of the skin in a broiler from the Ocident is rare because the white/yellow skin was selected through genetic enhancement, but there is some data about which mutations unleash melanosis in lineages selected to not have pigmentation. The broiler had multicentric melanosis and this alteration doesn't change functional activity of the stricken organs and doesn't represent any risk for human health, but the organs with this lesion were condemned for human consumption due to their macroscopic appearance.",

Sardine waste protein hydrolysate with high GH; 4. sardine waste protein hydrolysate with high GH diluted (10\% concentration) and 5. control using only distilled water. The fish were evaluated individually. After 48 hours fasting, the behavior was videotaped for a baseline period of 2 minutes, and for another 18 minutes after attractive inoculation. The design was completely randomized with three treatments and twenty repetitions. Experiment 2 was conducted to evaluate the effect of the sardine waste protein hydrolysate on the food intake of silver catfish. For this purpose agar pellets were produced containing or not sardine waste protein hydrolysate. The fish were evaluated individually and had an adjustment period of 7 days. The results were analyzed using the Goodman test (1964). Inoculation of the sardine waste protein hydrolysate with high and low GH increased the barbel movement time. The sardine waste protein hydrolyzate diluted with high GH yielded the same results as the hydrolysate with low GH, but did not differ from the average obtained for distilled water (negative control) and muscle extract. The increase in moving side to side in the aquarium was higher (P<0.05) for sardine waste protein hydrolysate with high and low GH. In experiment 2 the proportion of fish that ingested the pellets containing sardine waste protein hydrolysate was higher (P<0.05) than the proportion of fish that ingested the pellets containing distilled water.

Twenty one dairy cows were divided into two groups: Control Group (CON, n= 11), that received 5 injections of saline solution (20mL/animal 0.9 \% NaCl), and Catosal group (ABC, n= 10) which received 5 injections of 20mL of a Butafosfan and Cyanocobalamin solution (Catosal(r) B12, 100mg of Butafosfan and 50µg Cyanocobalamin for mL). The injections were performed by intramuscular route, on days 7, 12, 17, 22 and 27 postpartum. Blood samples were taken on these days to evaluate plasma concentrations of phosphorus, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK). On days 8 and 28 postpartum, the animals were weighted and subjected to the glucose tolerance and insulin challenge tests. The treatment promoted weight loss (ABC 40.4kg, CON 10.73kg, P 0.05) among groups on days 8 and 28; however, ABC animals showed higher serum glucose levels (P< 0.05) after insulin administration on day 28 postpartum (97.54 ±8.54mg/dL) when compared to day 8 (83.01 ±8.54mg/dL).

The milk samples after incubation in PSTA, the membranes used in water filtration were incubated in TSB and the material of the hands material, bucket and liners collected in the swabs were plated on MacConkey agar to obtain colonies. Characteristics of colonies were analyzed by duplex PCR to confirm the species. The molecular profiles of Y. enterocolitica isolates were compared using rep-PCR. Y. enterocolitica was isolated from 9,37\% of milk samples, 6,25\% of water samples and 12,5\% of hand samples. There weren't similarities in the band profile of the isolates found; however, the presence of different strains was found in the same sample, demonstrating a variety of strains distributed in the environment. The presence of Y. enterocolitica in raw milk in Brazil is dangerous, considering that the product is sold clandestinely, exposing consumers to the risk of infection by the bacterium, when consuming it without proper heat treatment.",

Urethral catheterization was attempted, unsuccessfully, and sonographic evaluation revealed vesical distention with approximately seven liters of content, hydrourether and hydronephrosis. cystocentesis and vesical deflation was performed. Surgical approach of the bladder was performed and a new ostium for the urethra in the vaginal vestibule was created by retrograde via. Urachal was removed and urethral catheterization was maintained for 10 days. Following 30 days of pos operative procedure, the animal was discharged.",

Of these, two goats (0.31\%), one sheep (0.15\%) and one bovine (0.12\%) were diagnosed with rupture of aorta due to the presence of aneurysms, corresponding to 0.19\% of causes of death in ruminants. Case 1 occurred in a goat that had good body condition and was found dead by the owner, case 2 occurred in a goat that had clinical presumptive diagnosis of caseous lymphadenitis, case 3 occurred in a sheep who was found dead by the owner, and case 4 occurred in a cow with a history of recurrent bloating. In all cases, death occurred rapidly by hypovolemic shock. The macroscopic findings at necropsy were hemothorax or hemoperitoneum and the rupture in the aorta artery. In goats, abscesses were viewed microscopically and they were associated with the presence of bacteria, suggesting for Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection. In the sheep, lesions that could explain the cause of the aneurysm were not observed, so we consider the aneurisma as idiopathic. In the cow, it was not possible to establish the cause, but the presence of the aneurysm hampered eructation of ruminal gases, causing secondary bloat. Aneurysms occur sporadically in goats, sheep and cattle and must be regarded as an important cause of sudden death.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The objective was to relate the need for analgesic postoperative recovery through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Glasgow, Colorado and Melbourne, by an experienced assessor (AE) and other non-experienced ones (ANE), in bitches undergoing total unilateral mastectomy. Otherwise healthy bitches, a total of 24, were admitted 24 hours before the surgical procedure for assessment of behavior with the help of the above scales to determine the baseline (M0) moment. They were pre-medicated with morphine and acepromazine (0,02 and 0,5 mg/kg) and general anesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg/kg) and maintained with isoflurane at 1\% MAC. The analgesic during surgery was maintained with ketamine and fentanyl (10 µg/kg/min and 10 µg/kg/h). The other evaluations were performed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively, and redemptions made with intramuscular morphine (0,5 mg/kg) when a greater than or equal score of 50, 6, 2 and 9 points was observed respectively for the described ranges, as observed by the AE and when at least two scales demonstrated these values. There was an increase of M1 to M12 pain scores for AE and the ANE for VAS. In Colorado analyses, the highest painful scores occurred in relation to M0 between M2 and M8 to the AE and M1 to M12 for ANE. In Glasgow analyses, higher scores were detected between M1 to M12 for AE and M1 to M24 for ANE. And for the Melbourne highest values were observed in M1 and M24 for AE and ANE. The best correlation between the scales was 0,775 between Glasgow and Colorado and of the evaluators of 0,925 to Glasgow. The Glasgow scale was shown to be more sensitive to detect painkiller redemptions in dogs undergoing total unilateral mastectomy, the inexperience of the appraiser does not compromise the quality of painful reviews, and it is suggested to reduce the score VAS and Melbourne to increase it is ability to detect rescue postoperative analgesics.",

Data was collected through qualitative field research, by means of interviews with 24 students, and quantitative field research, using a questionnaire regarding ethical conflicts with a sample of 281 medical students. Based on the students' views and bibliographic research, key issues regarding the preparation of the undergraduates' code of ethics were identified. As a result, the code dealt with rights and duties of lecturers, patients, the institution and society as a whole, considering even contemporary problems such as the use of social networks and college hazing. The study concludes that the collective drafting of the code is the beginning of a process that intends to encourage reflection on health care and social perspective in order to take decisions consistent with ethical and moral principles, respecting human dignity.",

The polysemic and pre-conceptual nature of ``paradigm'' is clarified, taking account of the conceptual implications, while reaffirming their semantic usefulness. Essential and cumulative ruptures are discussed and applied to the confrontation of the epistemic rupture brought about by district health centers and the goals of the public health reform movement. The difficulty of the collective health paradigm in maintaining its discursive independence is presented, such that the global spread of the discursive matrix of health centers by the Rockefeller Foundation still constitutes the most recent holistic paradigmatic rupture in Brazilian public health.",

The information came from cattle farms participating in the program of the Brazilian National Association of Breeders and Researchers (ANCP), from 2012 to 2013. Field data such as batch or management group were considered assessment criteria, and the growth traits related to body weight at 120 (W120), 210 (W210), 365 (W365) and 450 (W450) days under different scenarios: inclusion of all management lot information; and random inclusion of 90\%, 70\%, 50\%, 30\% and 0\% of the batch management of information from animals with phenotypic measurements. Breeding values were predicted by using univariate models in animal model. Changes on all genetic parameters were compared to those obtained in the reference scenario. There was an increase in the estimates of heritability as it reduced the number of details about lots of management. These results suggest that gene progress estimated herds with low quality information do not adequately represent what truly occurs with the herd, since heritability estimates may be inflated. Change in the classification of animals was found at all the growth traits. The quality information influences the prediction of breeding values for growth traits.",

Objective: To investigate the acute effect of two different SS volumes on neuromuscular system of young and elderly women during horizontal leg press. Methods: Twenty-four women (12 young and 12 elderly), apparently healthy, attended the laboratory on six different occasions. In the first three visits, collection of personal data, anthropometric, familiarization to SS protocol and recording of maximal isometric force-time curve in horizontal leg press were performed. In the last three visits, the isometric force-time curve and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles were performed after one of three experimental conditions: control (without stretching), stretching with a total volume of 60 and 120 seconds. The order of the experimental conditions was randomized. The SS protocol involved three exercises performed in two 30-second series (SS60) or in four 30-second series (SS120). The two-way ANOVA test was used for data analysis. Results: None of the SS routines resulted in changes in the rate of force development (RFD), maximal voluntary contraction, and EMG activity of young and elderly women. Conclusion: Different volumes of SS, in accordance with current recommendations, did not influence the neuromuscular performance of young and elderly women in the horizontal leg press exercise.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: The use of firearms by military police officers is usually preceded by pursuit on foot, and the physiological changes produced by physical exertion may affect shooting performance. Objective: To verify the effect of physical effort on shooting performance in military police officers. Methods: The sample consisted of 15 men (34.1 ± 5.4 years; 81.4 ± 8.8 kg; 171.3 ± 5.6 cm; 27.7 ± 2.3 kg/m²; 44.9 ± 4.0 ml.kg-1.min-1) of the riot police. In the first session, the subjects performed a maximal treadmill stress test in which the peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured. In the second session, shooting performance (score) and shooting time were measured pre and post-exercise, as well as the time spent to complete a circuit of obstacle running (297 m). Shooting efficiency index was calculated as the ratio between total score and shooting time. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normal distribution of the data. A paired t-test was used to compare the post-exertion outcomes variables as well as the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The time to complete the running circuit was 75.3 ± 4.4 s. Shooting performance (20.4 ± 11.4 vs. 17.6 ± 9.3 points), time (4.48 ± 1.1 vs. 4.23 ± 0.9 s), and efficiency (4.69 ± 2.7 vs. 4.35 ± 2.7 pts/s) did not present significant differences (P>0.2). Additionally, a correlation was detected between VO2peak and running time (r = -0.64; P=0.01), but not with shooting performance (P>0.05). Conclusion: Physical exertion does not affect shooting performance of military police officers. Although the level of aerobic fitness was not associated with shooting performance, it was associated with physical performance prior to shooting.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: There are several tools that measure physical activity in Brazil. One of them is the Three Day Physical Activity Recall; however, until now, no tool was subjected to cross-cultural adaptation. Objective: To describe the procedures and criteria for selecting the Three Day Physical Activity Recall on the conceptual, semantic and items equivalence, which resulted in the Brazilian version for adolescents from 10 to 12 years. Methods: Articles have been compiled containing the self-report instrument that had as variables of interest the level of physical activity and energy cost. A survey was conducted in the following databases: BIREME, LILACS, MEDLINE, PubMed, SciELO, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. The steps of cultural adaptation came next: 10 doctors and 30 members of the target population participated of the evaluation and adjustment of the construct to the Brazilian culture (conceptual and item equivalence) and the Portuguese version of the instrument followed all recommendations for semantic equivalence. Results: Here we present the evaluations of doctors on the Portuguese version of the instrument, involving questions about regionality of activities, cognitive impairment to self-report, instructions, ability to measure physical activity and their domains. The different versions of the translation and retranslation of the tool, highlighting on the changes requested as well as the final version are presented. Conclusions: Since the prerequisites of cultural adaptation have been met, it was concluded that the tool is adapted for the target population and culture; nevertheless, the psychometric qualities, reproducibility and validity, construct and criterion must be tested.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pain is a major complaint of individuals looking for healthcare services. The high prevalence of both acute and chronic pain makes it a public health problem, due to high costs imposed to society and healthcare services, in addition to the negative impact on daily activities of those living with such experience. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of chronic pain among medical students of a University in the countryside of São Paulo. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out with 395 students of all grades of the medicine course of the Universidade de Taubaté. Investigated variables were: pain incidence and duration, presence or not of triggering factor(s), use or not of painkillers, pain location and dimension according to McGill questionnaire. RESULTS: There has been predominance of females with 253 participants (64.05\%), prevailing the age group between 21 to 25 years with 217 students (54.93\%). Among participants, 219 (55.44\%) reported some type of pain and among them, 141 (64.38\%) have reported chronic pain, that is, for more than six months, in a total of 35.69\%. CONCLUSION: In our study, chronic pain prevalence was 35.69\%, especially among females. With regard to pain location, there has been more prevalence of lumbar and sacrococcygeal regions, followed by knees and headache, face and mouth and finally widespread pain.",

The study was approved by the School of Medicine of Brasilia University with support from PAHO and the Ministry of Health. A scale with 35 questions (knowledge, attitudes and practices) was the main dependent variable. Adjusted linear regression models identified the demographic and social determinant factors that explain scale variations. The scale attained a satisfactory level of consistency (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.689). Sociodemographic factors associated to scale variations include gender, race, education and civil status. Social determinants associated to scale variations include frequency of discussions about sexuality with parents and health professionals, alcohol consumption, leisure and being part of a social movement, access to the internet, interest in learning and having the father and/or teacher as a personal reference. Brazilian youths are vulnerable to the transmission of STDs/HIV\&AIDS. Public policies are needed to promote the engagement of parents and teachers in issues related to sexuality.",

Thus this article seeks to identify the determinants of efficiency that led this state to improve its educational performance, considering variables directly linked to education, as well as socioeconomic variables, which have great influence in this sector. The results clearly show the existence of clusters of municipalities considered benchmarking that geographically coincide with the locations of the three campuses of the medical school of the Federal University of Ceará. The variables, income, per capita expenditure and maternal education were shown as determinants of efficiency of Ceará municipalities, but the variable related to access to sanitary sewer showed to be a strong determinant of inefficiency, especially for the poor municipalities.",

In the context of recent decades, ascending forms of subjectivation have been focused on personal investment through bodily transformations, in which the consumption of ``innovative'' biomedical devices becomes crucial. Due to issues arising in this field, this article critically discusses some conceptual vectors. Analytical categories such as biomedicalization, pharmaceuticalization, and modes of subjectivation and improvement are central for the understanding of the processes involved. In the same direction, we need to consider the importance of questioning the boundaries between the investments associated with the maintenance of health and those motivated by improving themselves.",

Thus, studies that combine phy-sical performance and cardiorespiratory fitness are necessary to encourage and implement health promotion actions. Objective: To evaluate the response of physical performance and cardiorespiratory indicators in the spontaneous inter-ruption of a maximum progressive test in children. Method: Prospective, analytical, observational and cross-sectional study. One hundred and six children with a mean age of 10.2 ± 1.1 years participated in the study. Weight and height were obtained to determine the body mass index and the cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the maximum progressive Léger test. The observed variables were heart rate, respiratory rate, peak forced expiratory flow, maximum oxygen volume, and abdominal muscle strength. The children were divided according to their performance in the maximum progressive test, a group achieving up to 280 meters and a group achieving over 280 meters. Result: The mean value of body mass index was 17.8 kg/m2 and the maximum oxygen volume was 40.5 mlO2/kg-1.min-1. The group that reached the greater distance in the maximum progressive test had a lower body mass index (p=0.002), a higher speed (p=0.000), a longer time in the physical effort (p=0.000), higher maximum oxygen volume (p=0.000), and a greater abdominal muscle strength (p=0.007). The variables heart rate, respiratory rate and peak flow had values expected for age with no difference between groups. The group that reached the greater distance had a correlation with speed (r=0.950, p<0.000) and with oxygen volume (r=0.740, p<0.000). In contrast, the shorter distance group had a higher correlation with body mass index (r=-0.475, p=0.000) and respiratory rate (r=0.585, p<0.674). Conclusion: Children with a lower body mass presented better performance in the maximum progressive test, and girls stood out for the greater time of physical effort without increasing the maximum oxygen uptake.",

All the animals were submitted to swimming for 15 minutes. After the treatment, the animals were euthanized by halothane inhalation (Halotano) method. The brains were removed and stored in 4\% formal-dehyde solution for 24 hours. From each brain, homotypic samples were taken from the middle region of the brain in frontal cuts so that we could evaluate the areas established for this study. Results: Analyzes of the estimated cell profiles showed that there was a decrease in the number of profiles in the pallidal nucleus of the male animals treated with Winstrol Depot®. Conclusion: These results allow us to infer that inadequate and non-medical use of AAS can lead to cellular degeneration.",

Objectives: This study verified the influence of nutritional status on the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) and its components in children and adolescents. Methods: Descriptive, associative, cross-sectional study performed with a sample of 290 individuals from 10 to 18 years of age of both sexes. We assessed height, body mass, BMI, HDL-c, TG, and VAI. The following tests were used: Shapiro-Wilk, independent Student t test, Mann-Whitney U-test, ANOVA One-Way, Kruskal-Wallis, Bonferroni post hoc test, Pearson Correlation and odds ratio. The significance level was established at p<0.05. Results: The tests showed significant differences between the sexes for age, HDL-c, and VAI. Concerning the variables HDL-c, TG and VAI, significant differences were observed among the eutrophic adolescents and the other classifications of nutritional status. There was also a worsening of the variables used to calculate VAI for adolescents with altered nutritional status (non-eutrophic), indicating a higher cardiometabolic risk associated with overweight There was a strong correlation between VAI and TG (0.865) and moderate negative correlation between VAI and HDL-c (-0.405). After the odds ratio calculation, it was found that participants with overweight and altered WC, respectively presented 2.3 and 1.5 times more chance of cardiometabolic risk (altered VAI). Conclusions: The nutritional status is capable of influence the variables of cardiometabolic VAI, WC, TG, and HDL-c in children and adolescents. In this population, regardless of sex, as the BMI increases, there is a progression of metabolic changes. In addition, VAI index showed a significant correlation with TG, HDL-c, BMI, and WC of the children and adolescents in the study, which could be seen as an alternative to predict metabolic risk.",

Methods: Eighteen men (23.1±3.8 years; 78.4±8.6 kg; 1.72±0.06 m) performed three ST conditions: condition A: (bench press, shoulder press, preacher arm curl, half squat, leg press, leg extension); condition B (half squat, leg press, leg extension, bench press, shoulder press, preacher arm curl) and condition C (bench press, half squat, shoulder press, leg press, preacher arm curl, leg extension). The exercises were performed in three sets of 10 RM. The 1 RM tests for LL and UL were performed in the initial weeks and after the experimental conditions. Blood samples were taken at rest [T0], immediately after [IA], 3 [T3], and 5 minutes [T5] after each condition. SPE of UL, LL, and general, and VT were measured at the end of each condition. Results: The 1 RM was reduced after the session in all conditions for both UL (A = -19.4\%, B = -23.0\%, C = -22.8\%) and LL (A = -16.2 \%, B = -15.3\%, C = -16.1\%) with no difference between conditions. The SPE presented similar results between the conditions (Condition A=8.4, Condition B=8.7, Condition C=8.7).

The reduction of HRV may be associated with metabolic syndrome (MS). Objective: To compare the HRV and health variables in individuals with and without MS. Methods: One hundred and nineteen participants were divided into two groups: without MS (WOMS, n=68) and with MS (WMS, n=51). We evaluated the spectral analysis of HRV at rest, during cardiopulmo-nary exercise testing (CPET) and recovery in low frequency bands (LF = 0.04-0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF = 0.15-0.4 Hz) and LF/HF ratio. Resting heart rate (HRres), maximum heart rate (HRmax), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic (DBP), blood glucose, lipid profile, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and body composition were also evaluated. Results: There were no differences between HRres and VO2peak between the WMS and WOMS groups (73.3±9.1 vs. 70.1±11.0 bpm), (26.8±4.6 vs. 28.1±6.6 ml.kg-1.min-1), respectively. HRV was similar between the groups at the different moments analyzed. The blood glucose levels (99.8±22.5 vs. 87.6±8.6 mg/dl) were higher in WMS compared to WOMS.

HDL-c (40.7±11.5 vs. 49.3±9.8 mg/dl) was lower in WMS compared to WOMS. BMI (33.1±4.7 vs. 30.8±3.8 kg/m²) was higher in WMS compared to WOMS. The SBP (128.6±12.9 vs. 119.5±11.3 mmHg) and DBP (77.2±10.5 vs. 72.9± 8.1mmHg) were higher in WMS com-pared to WOMS, p<0.05. Conclusion: The results suggest that the presence of MS is not sufficient to induce changes in HRV at rest, during cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and in recovery when patients are compared to healthy individuals.",

Keeping the drop height constant, the variation of the landing technique can modify the performance and the mechanical characteristics of the jump. Objective: To evaluate the effects of different landing techniques on the performance and the reaction force of the vertical component of the ground after drop jump. Methods: Twenty-five healthy and physically active men (age: 26±8 years, total body mass: 75±10 kg, height: 175±10 cm) performed four landing techniques after the drop jump: bounce drop jump (BDJ), drop jump with 90° of knee flexion (DJ90), drop jump with 135° of knee flexion (DJ135), and drop jump with 135° of knee flexion with hands resting on the ground (DJ135A). Three attempts were performed for each technique; the subjects performed the drop jump falling from a 40 cm high force platform. The measures of jump height, contact time and impact were determined by the force of reaction of the vertical component of the ground, measured by the force platform, at a frequency of acquisition of 2,000 Hz. The repeated measures by ANOVA were used to compare the different techniques. Results: The BDJ technique presented lower jump height, shorter contact time and greater impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). The DJ90 technique presented jump height similar to the DJ135 and DJ135A techniques and a short contact time (P<0.001) and a lower impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). Conclusion: The highest jumps were observed for DJ90, DJ135 and DJ135A. The lowest contact time was observed in the BDJ technique, followed by DJ90. Regarding the impact, the BDJ technique presented the highest values.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Childhood obesity has been growing in recent years and is probably due to changes in lifestyle, such as inactivity and inadequate food consumption. In the overweight population, postural control, which is a prerequisite for various postures and activities, can be modified. Objectives: To evaluate and compare the postural control and physical activity in eutrophic, overweight and obese children at the age of eight of the public school network of Londrina, PR. In addition, to verify the association between physical activity and nutritional classification. Methods: The sample consisted of 346 children divided into three groups: eutrophic (n=205), overweight (n=69), and obese (n=72) who answered the questionnaire of physical activity for children (PAQ-C). The assessment of postural control was performed on a force platform, preferably in a unipodal position. Results: The prevalence of overweight children was 40.7\%, and the prevalence of sedentary ones was 82.9\%, with a median of three hours daily in front of the TV. The children presented a COP area of 13.41±6.77 cm2 in the unipodal position, the eutrophic group had COP area of 13.97±6.67 cm2, the overweight group, 12.34±5.71 cm2, and obese 13.59±7.94 cm2 (p=0.785). Girls had better performance in postural control than boys (p=0.000). The AP frequency (Hz) and ML (cm/s) presented a statistically significant difference (p=0.033 and p=0.016, respectively). It was also found association between eutrophic and overweight children and physical activity (p=0.013; X2=6.186; odds ratio = 0.308; p=0.020; X2=5.38, odds ratio = 0.293, respectively). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of overweight and sedentary children. Overweight did not affect the COP area (cm2), but interfered AP frequency and ML velocity. Physical activity proved to be a protective factor in eutrophic and overweight children. Therefore, physical activity intervention programs should be included in schools since they can have a preventive role regarding obesity and sedentary lifestyle.",

However, only the association between the Berlin questionnaire result and glycated hemoglobin remained significant in the adjusted multivariate analysis, for the traditional risk factors and for an additional model, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Conclusion The glycated hemoglobin, even below the threshold for diagnosis of diabetes, is independently associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, even after adjustment for obesity and C-reactive protein. These findings suggest a possible pathophysiological link between changes in insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, independently from obesity or low-grade inflammation.",

 abstract = "Abstract Obesity has nowadays reached epidemic levels and represents a public health issue. Despite of being traditionally treated through dietary reeducation and the practice of physical activities, these measures are not always effective to the treatment of morbid obesity. In such context, the bariatric surgery emerges as one of the main treatments for substantial weight loss that the medical science is able to currently offer. However, it is estimated that this procedure is efficient in 85\% of the cases- it can be seen, for instance, cases in which the patients eventually recover part of their lost weight and therefore develop dietary disorders or several compulsive behaviors. This article aims to comprehend the psychic suffering inherent to obesity, through a bibliographic review of Freudian psychoanalytic concepts. These concepts allow the comprehension of the psychic apparatus dynamic, emphasizing the concepts of death instinct, narcissism and melancholy. Out of the analysis of the ``Dead mother complex'', as described by André Green, we sustain the hypothesis that some obesities might be the consequence of an attempt to overcome a melancholic pain, a mourning that cannot be worked through and that is related to a narcissistic loss.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction In spite of technological advances, anamnesis and physical examination are still the most important and effective early diagnostic tools in any clinical case. However, many students graduate in medicine lacking these essential skills. The absence of a standardized physical examination is one of the main difficulties in the teaching-learning process. Objective To evaluate the clinical skills of medical intern students and the applicability of a simplified physical examination guide for improving these skills. Methods This was an analytical and quantitative-approach study, which compared before-and-after information among general medicine student interns from January to February 2014. The students were trained with the simplified guide for a 3-week period and their clinical examination was evaluated in 13 items: vital signs, examination of oral cavity, fundoscopy, otoscopy, thyroid examination, cardiovascular examination, pulmonary examination, abdominal exam, lymph nodes, anthropometric measurements, ankle-brachial index (ABI), neurological examination, examination of the breasts or testicles (examination of breasts for female patients and testicles for male patients). The result of the evaluation of each item was classified into 3 categories: complete evaluation, partial evaluation and no evaluation. Results A total of 31 students participated. Significant improvement was found in almost all items in relation to the complete evaluation after training with the guide: cardiovascular system (3.23\% versus 74.19\%, before and after training, respectively, p < 0.01), pulmonary system (22.58\% versus 90.32\%, p < 0.01), abdominal exam (22.58\% versus 74.19\%, p = 0.01), vital signs (16.13\% versus 100\%, p < 0.01), palpation of lymph nodes (6.45\% versus 77.42\%, p < 0.01), neurological examination (0\% versus 22.58\%, p = 0.02), thyroid palpation (0\% versus 61.29\%, p < 0.01), examination of oral cavity (6.45\% versus 67.74\%, p < 0.01), anthropometric measurements (0\% versus 45.16\%, p < 0.01), breast examination (0\% versus 36.84\%, p = 0.02), fundoscopy (0\% versus 32.26\%, p < 0.01), evaluation of the ankle-brachial index (0\% versus 83.87\%, p < 0.01), examination of the testicles (0\% versus 8.33\%, p = 1.0). An increase of 280.7\% was also observed in the students' median score after training (1.92 versus 7.31 points, P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between student performance and time on the medical course (R2 = 0.1242; P = 0.0515). Conclusions There is a large deficit in teaching clinical skills during undergraduate medical courses. As an effective solution, a simplified sequential clinical examination guide can serve as training for medical students.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Background There is a growing need to use palliative care (and support care) in health areas, particularly in Medicine. This is due to an aging population and the increased prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases, especially metastatic cancer and advanced dementia. Thus, it is very important to start the teaching-learning process in palliative care during undergraduate medical training. Purpose To evaluate: (1) knowledge in palliative care (KPC) among medical students at the Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde medical school (Brasília, DF), and (2) the gain in KPC among first, fourth and sixth-year students. Method A cross-sectional study involved the application of an anonymous questionnaire with questions about age, gender, and 19 questions about KPC. These questionnaires were applied separately to the students. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied. Thereafter, the Kruskal-Wallis test compared the 3 groups (first, fourth and sixth year students), and when any statistically significant difference was verified, post hoc analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.016).Results: The study included 193 students (inclusion rate: 76.8\%; 95\%CI: 71.0\%-81.8\%), 23.6±4.3 years-old, 100 women (51.8\%). The median KPC(interquartile) scores based on the number of correct responses per student of the first, fourth and sixth year of the course were: 4.00(2.00-5.00), 10.00(9.00-12.75), 12.00(10.25-14.00), respectively (p <0.001). When directly comparing the first and fourth year students, and the first and sixth year students, the statistical difference persists (p <0.001 and p <0.001, respectively); but the analysis between fourth and sixth year students shows no statistical difference (p=0.041). Conclusion KPC among our students is limited, and KPC gain between the fourth and sixth years of study was not statistically significant. This shows the need to improve the process of teaching and learning in palliative care, especially in internship scenarios.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The practice of hazing is a phenomenon that began in the middle ages and persists in many universities around the world. In Brazil, although the problem is widely recognized, it has been insufficiently studied. Objective To estimate the prevalence of hazing among medical students of a public university in São Paulo state – Brazil, and investigate factors associated with this problem. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted, including 477 medical students from the first to the sixth year of the course. The self-reporting questionnaire included questions and structured instruments to access: socio-demographic characteristics, aspects of academic life, social support, symptoms of depression, harmful alcohol use (using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test – AUDIT), common mental disorder (using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire – SRQ), whether the participant had suffered any form of hazing that he/she considered abusive or whether the participant had practiced hazing about which he/she felt guilty or regretful afterwards. Bivariate analyses were conducted, followed by logistic regression analyses to identify independent predictors of these two outcomes (having suffered abusive hazing or having participated in hazing and feeling regretful afterwards). Results The response rate was 87.0\%. Among the participants, 39.8\% (95\% CI: 35.4\% – 44.2\%) reported having suffered abusive hazing and 7.5\% (95\% CI: 5.2\% – 9.9\%) reported having practiced hazing. Those who reported having suffered abusive hazing were more likely to be male, to report difficulties in adaptation to the city, lower social support and psychiatric and/or psychological treatment after entering university. Those who practiced hazing and felt regretful afterwards were also more likely to be male, were older and presented higher mean scores in the AUDIT. Conclusion Hazing was associated with the male sex and mental health treatment among the victims, and with harmful alcohol use among the perpetrators. It is essential that medical schools discuss and better understand the problem of hazing in order to adopt effective preventive measures.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical education has been heavily debated in both national and international contexts due to changes in society and public health demands. In Brazil, it is postulated that learning in Primary Health Care (PHC) should occur throughout the entire medical course. Learning in PHC has faced some barriers such as inadequate environment for medical practice, including a lack of supervisors and general practitioners with insufficient training to assist students, lack of lecturers with expertise in the area, and resistance from traditional faculties to include PHC in the curriculum. This paper addresses an educational model to include PHC and family medicine in a medical school curriculum in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Furthermore, we describe the challenges of tying in educational and managerial objectives in the context of primary care services, and how to overcome such challenges. Our proposal is based on using educational objectives to develop student competencies (knowledge, skills and attitudes) so they can provide comprehensive care as regards the individual's background (social, family and environmental). Students are exposed to increasingly complex educational content that requires connecting new knowledge to previous knowledge. The innovative aspect of this educational project is its integration of planning and educational management, involving the following strategies to achieve a better quality learning process: (1) Students in primary care services from the first to the last semester of the course; (2) Hiring family doctors as faculty members; (3) Integrating PHC and family medicine with the contents of other subjects such as epidemiology, public health policies and evidenced-based medicine; (4) Using problem-solving methodologies suitable both to the studied theme and to student and lecturer profiles; (5) Formative evaluations; (6) Improving teaching skills for lecturers and field supervisors; (7) Implementing practices to encourage students to work in multi-professional teams; (8) Motivating students to take part in interchange programs with national and international institutions; and (9) Encouraging the publications of books, scientific papers and research into PHC and family medicine. Several factors facilitate the success of this educational proposal, including: PHC and family medicine being underlying matters in the political-pedagogical faculty project; the educational setting being that of an institution with a long history of health education, public care provision and contributions to service-learning integration; the close relationship between health service managers, lecturers and supervisors, which facilitates coordination between the theoretical content and practice in PHC; the investments made to develop supervisor teaching skills, to support their participation in the debate about relevant family medicine content, and in the discussion about integrating theory with practice; and finally the human resource policies that raise the value of family doctors who are also supervisors. We hope this experience contributes to enhancing the debate about PHC and family medicine educational models in medical courses, and the related challenges and possibilities within medical training.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT For years stress has been recognized as a major influence on professional and academic performance and on people's health. The period leading up to university admission is commonly recognized as a time that causes anxiety, stress and even depression. The causes related to such discomfort in this period are diverse, such as the pressure for success in the exam, family interference and competition. Besides, the medical course is seen as one of the most difficult and laborious because it requires dedication, effort, sacrifice and physical and emotional endurance of the students. Taking into consideration the stressors in student life, this research aimed to evaluate the presence of symptoms of stress among pre-school students and medical students in the city of Montes Claros (MG), by means of questionnaire forms investigating socio demographic factors and phases of stress (Inventory of Symptoms of Stress for Adults of Lipp). It was found from the statistical analysis that female pre-university students (p<0.001), and those with more than three years of study(p=0.012) and presenting headaches (p=0.010) displayed advanced stages of stress. Among the medical students, significant association was only observed between the presence of mood disorders and stress levels (p=0.023). Significantly higher resistance and depletion rates among pre-university students were detected when compared to medical students(p<0.001). It is prudent, therefore, to question the appropriateness of a competitive and stressful system to which young people is submitted for the simple aim of studying. It is necessary to emphasize the need for the young person to have the ability to deal with stress and anxiety, a fundamental element for success in the medical exam. There is, therefore, the need for psychological counseling of medical and preparatory course students in order to prevent the installation of stressing comorbidities that affect school and work performance.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Several studies have demonstrated that medical students' attitudes toward patient-centred care tend to decline throughout undergraduate education. At present, the adequate translation of the communication skills among medical students into clinical practice remains a challenge. Regardless of the increased efforts of educators to improve the provision of patient care, learning to communicate as a professional physician remains a complex process. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the ``doctor-patient relationship'' discipline on medical students' attitudes towards patient-centred care, and to examine whether variables related to demographic characteristics and different stages of education are associated to medical student's patient-centred attitudes. Methods Two-hundred and seventy nine medical students who responded a Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS), a validated instrument exploring attitudes towards the doctor-patient relationship were enrolled: 128 (45.9\%) who attended the ``Doctor-Patient Relationship'' discipline and 151 (54.1\%) volunteer students, matched by sex and age, who have not taken the discipline. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to quantify the independent association between PPOS scores (overall PPOS, `sharing' and `caring' dimensions), demographic variables and year of medical school. Logistic models were created to quantify the independent association between the ``doctor-patient relationship'' discipline and PPOS and the sub-scales scores. Results In the linear regression analysis, female gender (p ≤ 0.01), older age (p ≤ 0.02) and earliest years of medical school (p ≤ 0.02) were significantly associated with more patient-centred attitudes. Higher score on the `sharing' sub-scale was independently associated with attending the ``doctor-patient relationship'' discipline (4.50 ± 0.65 for those who have studied the discipline vs. 4.33 ± 0.65 for those who have not studied the discipline, p = 0.03) after adjustment, in logistic models, for student's age, gender and years on the medical course. Medical educators should be focused on innovative strategies that stimulate humanistic attitudes, improve communication skills and truly change medical students' behaviour towards patient-centred care.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Tobacco and alcohol consumption is considered a major cause of diseases and disorders in the world. In Brazil, there has been increased consumption of these drugs among young people, especially university students. Objective To discover the prevalence of and factors associated to smoking and alcohol consumption among medical students, as well as their level of knowledge about techniques to stop smoking at different times of their academic life. Methods Analytical study of prevalence among medical students in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. The study sample included all the city's medical schools and their first year (S1/S2) and fourth year (S7/S8) students and students in the final year of their internship (I3/I4). The sample was calculated considering an expected smoker frequency of 10\%, with a 3\% margin of error, estimating 726 students in the four institutions. A structured questionnaire containing 46 questions was applied. Data were analyzed using Stata 11.2 software. Results 1,035 students were interviewed, distributed proportionally in the three periods: 392 (37.87\%) from the first year (S1 / S2), 319 (30.82\%) from the fourth year (S7/S8) and 324 (31.30\%) interns (I3/I4). 553 students (53.4\%) were female; most of the students were single (993; 96.3\%), born in Fortaleza (748; 72.4\%), living with their parents (896; 86.8\%) and with a household income of more than 10 minimum wages (652; 61.8\%). In total, 533 (51.5\%) were students at private institutions. Of the total, 254 (24.6\%) had smoked. This consumption was significantly higher among males (p = 0.025), with no difference in relation to marital status (p = 0.247) or household income (p = 0.191). All the students who reported having experienced any tobacco derivative also reported using alcohol in their lifetime (p < 0.000). Alcohol consumption was reported by more than 80\% of the students, and was higher among those whose family income was more than nine times the minimum wage (p = 0.001). Alcoholic intoxication was reported by over 70\% of the students – where this had occurred before the age of 18 years. Beer and vodka are the most consumed beverages. Only 39.5\% said they were inclined to advise a patient to avoid alcoholic beverages and only 28.4\% had received training on the subject at their university. Conclusion The prevalence of alcohol consumption is very high among medical students, especially among those who reported smoking. These issues are addressed in a primitive manner in their training. We must strengthen these aspects in the training of future health professionals.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Due to the importance of radiology in medical research, disease diagnosis and prevention, allied to its current and future technological advances, it is imperative that more studies are conducted to evaluate its curricular dynamics. Objective To evaluate the curricular profile of radiology in Medicine, Physiotherapy and Biomedicine courses offered in public and private undergraduate educational institutions in the southern region of Brazil. Material and methods The class hours of the courses were analyzed and data about subjects that would be related to radiology (SRRs – Subjects Related to Radiology) was collected. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The proportionality of the class hours of the SRRs in the courses was made through correlation between the courses' total class hours and those allocated to the SRRs by analyzing Person's correlation coefficient. Student's t-test with a level of significance of P < 0.05 was employed to verify the existence of standardization in the radiological studies among the courses. Results The average class hours found in the courses was 58 hours. By analyzing every course separately, Biomedicine showed the highest average class hours compared to the Medicine and Physiotherapy courses. High variability in the courses was found in relation to the class hours of SRRs. Medicine and Biomedicine showed a positive correlation, i.e., the more class hours, the more class hours allocated to SRRs. In the Physiotherapy course a slight negative correlation was detected, i.e., the more course class hours, the less class hours were related to SRRs. Conclusion The results showed that Biomedicine and Medicine courses possessed the highest average class hours. Biomedicine had the biggest gap in class hours, and high heterogeneity with respect to the teaching of radiology between the courses analyzed and between the same courses at different institutions. Despite the study limitations that included not having access to specific class contents, the competencies and skills being taught, this study has contributed to the overall discussion regarding the curricular profile of courses that involve radiology.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The theoretical and practical experience of medical school can be approached using virtual environment learning strategies. In this respect, flexible time and space would appear advantageous for the establishment of the teaching-learning process in the period where there is a predominance of practical activities. The virtual environment can represent a space for sharing experiences and discussions with students in different practical scenarios. This case study aims at evaluating how medical interns perceived learning in two different scenarios using the Moodle virtual environment. The first intervention consisted of discussing clinical cases of patients with infectious and parasitic diseases who had been treated or assessed in primary or secondary health care by other interns. The second intervention involved completing the reflective portfolio, with teacher feedback regarding the activities performed by the interns during their public health internship. In both cases prior expectations, subsequent satisfaction and self-perceived learning were systematically analyzed. As a result, the responses of 36 students were evaluated in the first intervention, and of 30 students in the second, accounting for more than 97\% of the students invited. Most of them considered the Moodle environment suitable and reported knowledge/skill gain in both interventions. The main gains pointed to were improved skills for clinical reasoning and reflection on clinical practice in primary care. In the discussion of clinical cases, student involvement increased significantly once they were awarded marks for qualified participation in the activity. In the reflective portfolio, teacher feedback was considered an important motivating factor for the students. However, 51\% of their posts received no teacher feedback. In conclusion, the virtual environment was considered useful for student learning during internship, but there remains a need to develop the tutors' role in this process.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT While discussions develop regarding problems in the doctor-patient relationship and the deficiency of the clinical examination in medical practice, which leaves diagnoses more dependent of complementary tests, the importance of the computer in medicine and public health is highlighted. This is happening, either through the adoption of clinical decision support systems, the use of new technologies, such as wearable devices, or the storage and processing of large volumes of patient and population data. Data storage and processing capacity has increased exponentially over recent years, creating the concept of ``big data''. Artificial Intelligence processes such data using algorithms that continually improve through intrinsic self-learning, thus proposing increasingly precise diagnostic hypotheses. Computerized clinical decision support systems, analyzing patient data, have achieved a high degree of accuracy in their diagnoses. IBM's supercomputer, named ``Watson'', has stored an extraordinary volume of health information, creating a neural network of data processing in several fields, such as oncology and genetics. Watson has assimilated dozens of medical textbooks, all the information from PubMed and Medline, and thousands of medical records from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Memorial Hospital. Its oncology network is now consulted by numerous specialists from all over the world. The English supercomputer Deep-Mind, by Google, has stored data from 1.6 million National Health Service patients, enabling the development of new clinical decision support systems, analysis of these patient data and generating alerts on their evolution in order to avoid contraindicated or conflicting medications, whilst also sending timely updates to the physicians about the health of their patients. Analyzing a set of dermatological images in a melanoma study, Deep-Mind showed a higher level of performance than that of specialists (76\% versus 70.5\%), with a specificity of 62\% versus 59\% and a sensitivity of 82\%. Nevertheless, whereas the computer provides the know-what, it is the physician that will discuss the medical problem and the possible solutions with the patient, indicating the know-why of his or her case. This area requires continuous focus on the quality of medical training, emphasizing knowledge of the physiopathology of the organic processes and the development of the abilities to listen to, examine and advise a patient and, consequently, propose a diagnosis and treatment, accompanying his or her evolution.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Over the last two decades, curriculum changes and developments have taken place at medical schools, aimed at humanizing medical training. It is believed that this will enable these professionals to meet the current demands of the changing health care system. Within context of this new approach, one can highlight the importance of methods of breaking bad news being included in undergraduate medical training. This will aid students to act empathetically and efficiently in not only this specific situation, but all situations. Emotionally-loaded content reinforces the need for student medics to be adequately prepared to know how to deal with both the reactions of patients and their own feelings. This article consists of a cross-sectional study, in which we evaluated the ability of delivering bad news and the communication skills of medical students. The students were from a preclinical science training course and analyzed by means of a checklist during an OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). A sample consisting of 119 second-year students from the University of Fortaleza medical school was evaluated, of which 67\% reported an overall performance of greater than 90\%. The greatest difficulty observed when breaking bad news was their making of a ``brief announcement'' at the beginning of the consultation (35.3\%). However, the students were efficient at not ``sugarcoating'' the bad news, with none of the students failing in this aspect of the evaluation. Furthermore, the ability of identifying the influence of the symptoms in the patient's life using the Kübler-Ross model of grief and loss and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale was assessed, with 84.1\% of the students identifying it correctly. Therefore, in order to improve this essential skill in medical practice, one can underline the importance of drawing on personal experiences in teaching-learning, as patient actors, of training among peers, of an approach that includes standardized procedures and reflections on the importance of these strategies in teaching how to break bad news.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Homeopathic medicine was recognized by the Federal Council of Medicine as a medical specialty in 1980, and since then its teaching as part of medical training has grown in Brazil. Homeopathic medicine was first taight in Brazil in 1994 in the undergraduate medicine program of the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF). The history of teaching Homeopathy in the UFF medical course was analyzed in a qualitative-approach case study using documental analysis, direct observation, individual interviews with coordinators and students, and focus groups with alumni from five disciplines that address Homeopathy. The path identified involved resistance and progress, triggered by the curricular reform process in context of the implementation of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and the expansion of primary care. The teaching of Homeopathy in the UFF medical course was supported by the collaboration of external professionals. The major challenges included consolidating the discipline on the compulsory curriculum, acheiving integration with other clinics, hiring qualified teachers and recreating an outpatient Homeopathy school environment for supervised practice. From the perspective of integration and complementarity of the biomedical approach, humanized medical practice and comprehensive care were the most mentioned contributions. In the compulsory subjects it is argued that students can develop skills and abilities to: (a) guide and refer patients to Homeopathy whenever they might benefit from this medical practice; and (b) hold dialogues with homeopathy colleagues concerning the monitoring of common patients. The optional subjects are important for students who want to broaden their theoretical and practical training in Homeopathy, aimed at offering a professional practice that includes this specialty and permits the integration of the vitalist and biomedical paradigms in health care. The teaching of Homeopathy in the UFF undergraduate medical program is supported by its academic community's commitment to a plural health education that enables future professionals to use different paradigms for dealing with the disease process, the body and people in a contemporary society. This, in turn, contributes to improving relationships with patients, promotes autonomy, reduces invasive and insensitive approaches and expands comprehensive health care and resolute health work. This critical study of the trajectory of Homeopathy education in the UFF undergraduate medical course adds support to reflections on its teaching in other medical schools, including schools that already contemplate Homeopathy in their schedule or schools that are planning to include it in their curriculum in response to student and teacher demand.",

Method: we conducted a prospective, longitudinal, observational study comparing the assumptions of bariatric surgeons obtained through responses on a specific questionnaire with the reality found in clinical data from the hospital records. We analyzed the following variables: preoperative fasting, early postoperative feeding, intravenous hydration, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, use of abdominal drains, type of analgesia, and prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting. We confronted the responses of seven surgeons with data from 200 records of patients undergoing gastroplasty for morbid obesity. Results: all interviewed surgeons knew the ACERTO Project. Five (72\%) responded that they followed the protocol thoroughly. The median time of preoperative fasting found in the records was higher than the reported by the surgeons (p<0.05). Early postoperative feeding was prescribed for 96.5\% of cases. The median volume of intravenous fluids prescribed in the first 24 hours was 4000ml, which was consistent with the interviews. There were no differences between the response in the questionnaire and the findings in the hospital records in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis, use of catheters and drains, analgesia and prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting. Conclusion: the ACERTO Project was well practiced among the surveyed surgeons. There was a good correlation between their assumptions and the reality in perioperative care of patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

The objective of this work was to compare the digestibility of the diet of nutrients in horses obtained by standard method (total collection of feces - TCF) and estimated by two internal indicators ( Klason Lignin - KL and indigestible Acid Detergent Fiber.- iADF) ) and external indicator NANOLIPE®, aiming to validate the latter for use in equine nutrition. In a randomized block design, eight Mangalarga Marchador adult mares were used to evaluate treatments (CBC, iADF, LK, NANOLIPE®). The diet was composed of 1.5\% PV hay Coast Cross, 1.0\% PV of commercial concentrate, divided into two daily treatment.. The trial lasted 13 days, with 8 adaptation to the diet and the handling and 5 for the experimental procedures. In the first five days of the experimental period total feces was collected and in the 3th and 4th day the animals received NANOLIPE® administered once a day through capsules of 0.25 g / animal / day orally. Using the method of TFC as standart, the Klason Lignin and iADF proved inadequate (P0,05) for estimating the digestibility of nutrients in the equine species. There were differences (P <0.05) between fecal production values estimated by iADF (0.86 kg DM) and LK (0.60 kg DM) compared to those observed in CTF (2.16 kg DM) and NANOLIPE® (2.17 kg DM) with under- or overestimation of the digestibility of DM, NDF, ADF, HEM, ED, OM and CP estimated by internal indicators. The NANOLIPE® got high recovery rate (100.46\%) and the digestibility coefficients of all nutrients were similar to those obtained by the CTF. The NANOLIPE® indicator was efficient to estimate fecal output and apparent digestibility of dietary nutrients in horses when provided for two days, with a daily application and start collecting feces 24 hours after administration.",

A total of 32 Arabian horses were evaluated, with 400 (±32kg) trained for endurance races, who competed in four events in free speed categories 80 km (n = 13), 120km (n = 14) and 160km (n = 5). Blood samples were collected before the start (M0), immediately after leaving the last veterinary inspection (M1) and three hours later (M2). Already at their farms, samples were taken at three (M3), seven (M4) and 14 (M5) days after the race. There was an increase of values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin and packed cell volume after the end of the race in all horses and this increase was maintained until three hours after the race in the of 120 and 80km horses. There was an increase in the number of platelets in all horses, which remained elevated up to 3 hours after the test and normalized on the third day. All horses underwent increase in neutrophil counts and decreased lymphocyte count immediately after the race and three hours later, returning to normal after the third day. There was also pronounced increase in the number of eosinophils in all horses on the third day, which lasted until the seventh after the race. An unheard of data of this study was an increase in blood eosinophils after three days of competition that remained until the seventh day. This may signal the participation of these cells in the repair process. The evaluation of blood components proved to be an important tool for the assessment of recovery of the animals. As only horses that finished the race were evaluated, the changes found within days of effort, indicate the importance of further studies to investigate the steps and components of the metabolic and muscular recovery, in order not to commit excesses, returning the animals to activity at the right time.",

The origin of this disease, as well as its pathophysiology, are still unknown. It is believed that it can be congenital or acquired. No predilection for race, sex, or age has been verified. The aim of this paper is to report a lumbar MAC case in a dog at 13 years of age that caused paralysis of the pelvic limbs. At the clinical examination the patient had back pain on the lumbar region, urinary and fecal incontinence, and paraplegia on the pelvic members. The symptoms were progressing for eight months with history of trauma. In myelography a MAC in the lumbar region (L1- L2) lateralized to left was identified. For treatment laminectomy and durectomy were established. The patient showed improvement of clinical signs eleven days after surgery. The surgical treatment achieved good results for this type of disease. MAC can occur in geriatric or member paraplegia dogs, so it must be included in the differential diagnosis list of the lumbar compressive myelopathy.",

This study evaluated the effect of inulin extracted from yacon roots (Smallanthus sonchifolius) on intestinal colonization of broilers experimentally infected with Salmonella Enteritidis. Sixty-one day old chicks were grouped into three treatments, with two replicates, and reared until 21 days. Birds in the yacon group received 100mg of inulin/day orally for three consecutive days. On the seventh day of life the treated birds and the positive control were challenged orally with a culture of S. Enteritidis. There were no differences between groups in live performance. The infectivity index of the chicks supplemented with yacon was lower until the sixth day after the challenge, but at the end of the experiment it was higher than the positive control. Data from this study show that the use of inulin during the first 3 days of life caused a reduction of intestinal colonization of chickens by Salmonella Enteritidis in the first week after challenge. Further studies are needed to determine the dose and the ideal time of treatment necessary for a longer protective effect.",

Methods: Between 2008 and 2012, all third-year medical students were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire based on the Global Health Professionals Student Survey and its additional modules. Results: The study sample comprised 556 students. The level of agreement with the World Health Organization recommendations was high, except for the components ``received smoking cessation training'' and ``raising taxes is effective to reduce the prevalence of smoking''. Most of the students reported that they agree with banning tobacco product sales to minors (95\%), believe that physicians are role models to their patients (84\%), and believe that they should advise their patients to quit cigarette smoking (96\%) and using other tobacco products (94\%). Regarding smoking cessation methods, most of the students were found to know more about nicotine replacement therapy than about non-nicotine therapies (93\% vs. 53\%). Only 37\% of the respondents were aware of the importance of educational antismoking materials, and only 31\% reported that they believe in the effectiveness of encouraging their patients, during medical visits. In our sample, the prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 5.23\%; however, 43.82\% of the respondents reported having experimented with water-pipe tobacco smoking. Conclusions: Our results revealed the need to emphasize to third-year medical students the importance of raising the prices of and taxes on tobacco products. We also need to make students aware of the dangers of experimenting with tobacco products other than cigarettes, particularly water-pipe tobacco smoking.",

Biochemical assessments of ten adults coatis serum were perfomred, five animals in group 1, population exposed to humans and five animals of the group 2, population less exposed. With the obtained results, comparisons were made between the groups' biochemical values and the reference values found in the literature. Biochemical tests revealed significant changes in glucose levels and total protein and changes in plasma levels of triglycerides in coatis captured in the population in direct contact with humans. It follows that the health of animals that have direct exposure to humans is being affected by the consumption of a diet high in carbohydrates and fats, coming from processed foods provided by tourists.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Skin grafting is a simple surgical technique and useful to repair wounds, especially those where there is a difficulty to apply primary closure skin or other reconstructive techniques. However, for graft survival a healthy wound bed and the presence of an exuberant granulation tissue are necessary. This study aimed to evaluate the application of amniotic membrane and laser therapy as potential healing stimulants in grafts applied in wounds without granulation tissue. For this, we used 42 rabbits divided into four treatment groups, control group (CG), membrane group (MG), laser group (LG) and membrane and laser group (MLG), submitted to macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. The macroscopic examination showed that the patients of the groups where the amniotic membrane was used in order to stimulate re-epithelialization (MG and MLG) presented evidences associated with severe inflammatory reaction, graft integration failure and consequent necrosis. LG patients apparently had the best graph aspect in the last valuation date. Microscopic examination showed intense integration of the graft to the dermis, high re-epithelialization level, and scarce inflammatory cells in the graft site of LG patients. The opposite was observed in patients in the MG and MLG groups, where a rejection of the membrane was observed. Finally, collagen formation was not correlated with other factors such as inflammation and necrosis in any of the treatment groups. We can conclude that laser therapy was effective, contributing to the healing process and integration of the graft. Thus, canine amniotic membrane should not be used for this purpose because it causes intense inflammatory reaction besides avoiding graft nutrition.",

The experimental design was randomized blocks in factorial 2X2, composed of four treatments with four replications. There was no interaction (p>0.05) between the levels of nitrogen fertilization and growth stages of harvest for all variables. The production of dry matter in the dough stage and pre-flowering were 10.171 and 4.982kg ha-1, respectively. The higher N rates increased the production of dry matter of 775kg ha-1. There was increased participation of spikes with the advancement of the cycle, presenting 43.0\% and 16.2\% in the dough stage and pre-flowering, respectively. In the growth stage of pre-flowering, the share of green leaf was higher (37.1\% against 9.8\% of the total MS). The hay harvested at dough stage had lower NDF and CP levels. Thus, each treatment presented favorable characteristics allowing its use in different strategies in ruminant nutrition.",

In veterinary medicine, hemoglobin polymorphism has been studied in production animals, but there are no reports of hemoglobinopathies in dogs, and studies involving hemoglobin polymorphism in this species are scarce.

These samples were subjected to alkaline electrophoresis of hemoglobin, which permitted separation and quantification of hemoglobin fractions by densitometry, and then subjected to hemoglobin electrophoresis in an acid medium, a technique used in human medicine for the separation of variant fractions of hemoglobin that do not differentiate in an alkaline medium. The erythrogram and RBC indices were obtained concurrently. The methods demonstrated that HbA is the major component of canine hemoglobin, and a small amount of HbA2 can be detected in some of the evaluated animals, and most dogs showed only HbA in its composition. It was concluded that the presence or absence of HbA2 does not interfere with RBC indices of evaluated animals, and the comparison between the hemoglobin of Experimental and Control groups showed no differences in fractions distribution between them, and there was no hemoglobin variants in evaluated canines.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tramadol or butorphanol roosters submitted to osteosynthesis of humerus. Twelve roosters (Gallus gallus domesticus) randomly into two groups were used: Tramadol group (TG) received as premedication 5mg.kg-1 of tramadol and butorphanol group (GB) as premedicated with 1mg.kg-1 of butorphanol. Then the induction occurred with the administration of inhalational anesthetic, isoflurane 3V\% and anesthetic maintenance with the same agent 1.3V\%. We evaluated systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and body temperature (BT). The evaluations were performed: before MPA (M0); 15 minutes after MPA (M1); after induction (M2) and different surgical times (M3, M4, M5 and M6). Postoperative analgesia was assessed by the modified scale of pain in birds by 2 reviewers blinded to the treatments in times: baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively; being the analgesic rescue perfomed when a higher sore than or equal to six points of a total of 24 were observed. Observed reduction in HR, RR and BT between M2 and M6 moments compared to baseline in both groups, and in GB periods of apnea were observed between M2 and M6, and between groups at higher values f in GT were M5 observed when compared to GB. SBP decreased only when M3 relative to baseline in the TG group. Postoperatively only a GT animal needed analgesic rescue with a higher score on the GT between M1 and M8 and GB between M1 and M12 compared to baseline, and between groups only T12 was higher in GB when compared to the GT. It was concluded that through the evaluation scale used analgesic, butorphanol, and tramadol showed satisfactory analgesia and may be used to control pain roosters subjected to fixation of the humerus.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT: Among the biological properties of propolis, the antimicrobial activity has received prominent attention. In this paper, we describe the antiviral and virucidal effect of three hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis (brown, green and jataí bees (Tetragonisca angustula), against bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea Virus (BVDV). All hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained from ethanol extraction. The chemical composition of propolis extracts was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometer (UFLC-PDA-ESI-TOF/MS) to identify and quantify compounds such as caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic, and flavonoids such as rutin. Cell toxicity and antiviral activity of propolis extracts in monolayers of MDBK cells (Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney) were assessed by microscopic observation and quantified by the MTT assay (3- (4.5 dimethylthiazol-2yl) -2- 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolato bromine). Propolis extract from Jataí bees proved to be less cytotoxic (1.57mg / ml) when compared to green extracts (0.78mg / ml) and brown (0.39mg/mL). Regarding antiviral activity, propolis has shown greater efficacy in both cellular treatments (post and pre-exposure) against BoHV-1 when compared to other extracts, ie, there was increased cell viability compared to cell and virus controls. Extracts from Jataí showed activity against both viruses (BoHV-1 and BVDV) infection in the pre-test, whereas brown propolis demonstrated action only against the BoHV-1 in the pre-infection method. To determine the virucidal activity, it were used different dilutions of virus, as well as different temperatures and incubation times. The green propolis at 37°C led to a greater reduction in viral titer (4.33log) compared to brown (3.5log) and jataí (3.24log). Jataí propolis showed the best results in both temperatures (22oC and 37oC) when tested against BVDV. In summary, the evaluated extracts showed antiviral and virucidal activity against BoHV-1 and BVDV, and may be important targets for the development of new compounds as an alternative to commercial antivirals.",

Objective: To evaluate the effect of diets with vegetable and animal protein content on the body composition of Wistar rats submitted to resisted ladder exercise. Methods: Forty male newly weaned rats were exposed to a period of adaptation to a commercial diet (4 weeks) and resistance training for eight weeks (three times a week), receiving diets with bacuri flour and whey protein. They were randomly assigned to 6 groups: G1 (sedentary bacuri), G2 (exercised bacuri), G3 (sedentary WP), G4 (exercised WP), G5 (sedentary control) and G6 (exercised control). Dietary intake, body weight, length, thoracic and abdominal circumferences were evaluated to calculate Lee index and body mass index; the fat sites were removed after euthanasia. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Tukey's test, considering a 5\% significance level. Results: The final weight of G3 (372±8.86 g) was higher than those of G2 (326.83±15.03 g) and G6 (316.75±5.90 g); the groups that received diet with bacuri flour consumed higher amount of food, however, they had lower final weight, did not differ in the Lee index and BMI, fat sites and adiposity index in relation to the groups treated with WP, presenting lower values in the thoracic and abdominal circumferences. Regarding fat and adiposity index, there was no difference between the sedentary and exercised groups. Conclusion: The bacuri almond protein showed good quality when compared to whey protein, and it is possible to recommend its use in the preparation of nutritional supplements as an alternative and low cost vegetable protein source.",

Objective: To evaluate the effects of a session of dynamic resistance exercise on blood pressure, heart rate and the double product in SHR female rats with spontaneous hypertension. Methods: We used 8 female SHR rats in the non-ovulatory phases of estrous cycle. Two days after the carotid artery cannulation, blood pressure was recorded for 20 minutes at baseline and for 60 minutes (5 min.; 15-30 min.; 30-45 min. and 45-60min.) after one session of dynamic resistance exercise in a ladder (20-40\% of maximum load). Results: There were no changes in systolic blood pressure (baseline: 191±6.1 vs. recovery 45-60min., 191±7.8 mmHg), diastolic (baseline: 157±2.6 vs. recovery 45-60min., 156±3.7 mmHg) and mean blood pressure (baseline: 174±2.5 vs. recovery 45-60min., 173±4.9 mmHg) during the 60 minutes post-exercise. However, there was a reduction in heart rate (45-60min. 330±10 vs. 379±15 bpm) and normalization of the double product (64390±3529 mmHg.bpm) in the recovery period compared to the baseline. Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrated that moderate-intensity dynamic resistance exercise induces reduced heart rate associated with normalization of the double product in female SHR rats, despite the absence of post-exercise hypotension. These results suggest good control of cardiovascular risk after a dynamic resistance exercise of moderate intensity in hypertensive patients.",

Objective: To evaluate and compare cardiopulmonary variables, handgrip strength (HGS) and body composition between cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus and healthy individuals, and to correlate maximal oxygen uptake (VO2MAX) with HGS. Methods: This survey is characterized as a case-control study composed of 36 participants (18 cirrhotic patients with HCV and 18 healthy individuals) of both sexes, older than 18 years. The palmar grip strength was measured by dynamometry using a mechanical handle dynamometer with adjustable handle. The ventilatory variables were evaluated by ergospirometry with a progressive load test on a cycloergometer. The body composition was measured by a level II cineanthropometry technician. Independent t test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparison between groups and Spearman correlation for association between variables. Results: There were differences in maximal oxygen uptake 16.20 (11.60-18.55), median and interquartile range x 19.90 (16.27-26.85), ventilation 45.40 (36.45-54.20) x 63.40 (50.40-78.00), carbon dioxide production 785.88 (655.81-963.14) x 988.04 (826.93-1546.21), maximum heart rate (127.66 ± 23.26, mean and ± SD) x (146.29 ± 23.31), first ventilatory threshold (10.700 ± 3.19) x (14.912 ± 4.45) and second ventilatory threshold (14.16 ± 4.48) x (18.25 ± 5.54) between cirrhotic patients and controls, respectively. We found a moderate positive correlation between maximal oxygen uptake and handgrip strength (r=0.474, p=0.047) Conclusion: There are changes in cardiopulmonary variables and there is an association between VO2MAX and HGS in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C virus.",

Therefore, the population has a high consumption of the dietary supplement Whey Protein and this exacerbated use becomes worrisome. Objective: To evaluate the profile of Whey Protein (WP) intake as well as verify how it is used, what types are consumed and whether this consumption is associated with physical activity and if there is any professional recommendation. Methods: The analyzed population was of students in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, enrolled in undergraduate courses of Biological, Natural and Agricultural areas. The areas considered were selected by raffle and in total there were 11 courses belonging to these areas that agreed to participate in the study. The research tool used to the proposed objective was a questionnaire composed of 15 questions, four of which were multiple-choice questions. Results: A total 133 individuals aged 18 to 28 years (58.6\% males and 41.3\% females) participated in the study. As for income, 71.4\% of participants earn on average up to three minimum wages. The main reason for consumption of Whey Protein was muscle hypertrophy (83.5\%). The use of Whey Protein supplement was indicated in 62.4\% of cases by friends, sellers, or own initiative. Conclusion: It is evident in the study that the search for better physical performance associated with aesthetic standards seems to be boosting the use of Whey Protein, however it is also necessary to know the risk of excessive use, especially when there is no qualified professional follow-up nor recommendations on quantity, type, and fractionation of the supplement.",

Despite the increasing number of practitioners of this sport in Brazil, no epidemiological data on paragliding injuries were found in the country. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the incidence, type, anatomical area affected, severity, and to verify if there is any pattern in the lesions in paraglider pilots in Brazil. Methods: A Quantitative, descriptive, analytical, cross-sectional, retrospective study was carried out using an adapted questionnaire from the Accident Notification Form of the German agency LBA - Federal Office of Civil Aeronautics to obtain information relevant to the research objectives. The application of the questionnaire was conducted online, through Google Forms Results: There were 575 valid participations, of which 92.7\% were male, and 30.4\% were between 41 and 50 years old. Among them, 68.6\% reported having already had an injury in this sport. The anatomical region with the highest injury incidence was the lower limbs (44.09\%), the landing being the flight phase in which most of the lesions occurred (68.01\%). A logistic regression identified that ``age'' and ``type of homologation'' were the two factors associated with the occurrence of injury in the studied sample. Conclusion: Based on this research, it is possible to develop a functional training program for the practitioners of this modality, aiming at a better performance, measures of prevention of injuries associated to the sport, as well as to provide adequate rehabilitation to paragliding pilots.",

Aim: To verify the association between the frequency of park use and different types, volumes and intensities of leisure time physical activity in adults from Curitiba, Brazil. Methods: In 2009 a cross sectional study, with a household survey, was conducted in representative sample of 1,461 adults living near to eight urban parks. The frequency of park use was assessed through a self-reported and ordinal scale describing four levels of park visits. Weekly minutes per week of walking, moderate, vigorous and total physical activity were assessed through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The associations were tested with Poisson regressions (p<0.05). Results: A positive association between park use and walking, moderate and total physical activity among men was observed (p<0.05). Among women such association was found only for walking and total physical activity (p<0.05). Park use in a frequency of ≥4 times/wk can increase in approximately three times (PR: 2.96; CI95\%: 1.92-3.66) the likelihood of individuals to achieve the total physical activity recommendations (≥150 min/wk). Conclusion: Park use was positively associated with physical activity among adults, with greater effect among men. These results can help managers to guide specific actions to promote of park use and physical activity practices at the places.",

Sixteen adult Wistar rats were divided into treated and control groups. The offspring of the treated group received L-thyroxine from weaning to 40 days-old. At weaning, plasma assay of free T4 was measurement on female rats. In the offspring, the following assessments were performed: measurement of total T3 and free T4, histomorphometry analysis of the thyroid, measurement of body weight and length and width of the femur. In femoral growth cartilage, immunostaining of CDC-47, gene or protein expression of VEGF, Flk-1, Ang1, Ang2 and Tie2 were evaluated. Data were analyzed using Student's t-test. Free T4 was significantly higher in treated rats and total T3 and free T4 were significantly higher in offspring. The width of the femur was significantly lower in treated animals. There was lower immunoreactivity of CDC-47, VEGF and lower expression of gene transcripts for VEGF and Ang1. We concluded that the excess maternal thyroxine associated with postnatal hyperthyroidism reduces the width of the femoral shaft, the cell proliferation and gene and protein expression of VEGF and gene expression of Ang1 on the growth cartilage in rats.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The crossbreed with the Jersey breed has been used mainly as an alternative to increasing the concentration of milk solids in Holstein herds, the production capacity of these animals having become the focus of several studies. However, there is still limited information on many relevant factors for decision-making and management of crossbreed herds, such as disease resistance and ease of calving, and this is the motivation for this work, which aimed to evaluate the health, immunity and calving difficulty in Holstein x Jersey crossbred cows compared to pure Holstein cows. Data from calving difficulty, retained placenta, gestation length, blood indicators for postpartum metabolic diseases (ketosis and hypocalcemic puerperal paresis) and immunity in a herd composed by crossbreeds and Holstein cows during one year was analyzed. The genetic groups did not affect ease of calving (P = 0.4376), retained placenta (P = 0.7074) and gestation length (P=0.2812). Crossbred cows had higher concentrations of gammaglobulins (1.776 versus 1.456g/dL) and total protein (7.019 versus 6.525g/dL). For the concentration of BHBA, differences occurred only at calving, with higher values for crossbred cows (0.580 versus 0.427mmol/L). Difference was observed between genetic groups for concentration of ionized calcium (P = 0.082), with crossbred cows presenting lower concentrations (3.92 versus 4.3mg/dL). In conclusion, crossbred cows have superior performance compared to Holstein cows for immunity indicators and lower for hypocalcemic puerperal paresis and ketosis indicators on the day of calving. Crossbred cows do not have an increased risk of dystocia in relation to pure Holstein cows when mated with Holstein bulls.",

Intestinal parasites affect animals in captivity, reducing their survival and reproduction. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of quicklime for use in soil disinfection and prevention of reinfection of endoparasites in paca (Cuniculus paca) kept in captivity. Soil samples of pacas' stalls were analyzed using the modified Rugai method. Two experimental stages were evaluated; the first at 5, 45 and 105 minutes after treatment and the second at 7 days and 14 days after treatment. The pH values of the samples were checked after the application of four treatments. An application of 400g/m2 of quicklime spread out on ground or 500mL/m2 of three lime solutions (10\%, 20\% or 40\%, w / v) applied on ground. In the first stage, the lime spread out on soil was ineffective in parasites control, while the 10\% solution provided the best control of parasites. In the second stage, the solutions were effective in raising the pH, but there was no significant difference in larval findings. In conclusion, under the conditions of the study, 10\% solution increased the soil pH and had good ability to inactivate the eggs of Strongyloides sp.; that is economically interesting. However, for effective control of Strongyloides sp. in pacas kept captive, both the frequency of application of solutions up to 20\% of lime and the adoption of a good worming schedule should be taken into consideration.",

The experimental design was completely randomized with repeated measures on time, three levels of supplement and six grazing periods. The stay time at each feeding station (9.4 sec.) was similar for heifers exclusively on pasture and receiving 1.0\% supplement BW. Heifers that received 0.5\% supplement BW remained 1.1 sec. longer at the feeding station than heifers on other supplement levels. Displacement between feeding stations (1.7 steps) and the number of bites in each feeding station (7 bites) were similar regardless of the supplied rice bran level. Heifers receiving 0.5\% rice bran BW are more dependent on the presence of leaf blades in grazeable stratum of canopy.",

We also evaluated the degree of difficulty in bypassing the cervix, time required to perform the insemination, presence of bleeding after insemination, semen backflow, as well as the volume and the total reflow cells 30 minutes after insemination. Gilts submitted to PCAI (n = 279) were inseminated with 45 mL doses of 1.5 x 10⁹ sperm cells and the ones submitted to TAI (n = 273) were inseminated with 80 mL doses with 2.5 x 10⁹ cells. The bypassing of the cervix was possible in 91.04\% (254/279) of gilts. The difficulty bypassing the cervix in at least one of the gilt's PCAI procedures happened with 41.58\% (116/279) of the females, but it did not affect reproductive performance (P>0.05). The presence of bleeding after insemination did not affect the farrowing rate and total number of piglets born for both treatments (P>0.05). The average time needed to carry out the PCAI was 1.47 minutes and the TAI was 4.04 minutes. The percentage of sperm present in the reflux was higher in TAI than the PCAI, but no correlation was found between litter size and the percentage of sperm in reflux (P>0.05) and the total number of piglets born (11.63 and 11.81) between TAI and PCAI treatments, respectively.

Since abdominal viscera point towards the chest making occlusion of defective intracorporeal sutures difficult, paracostal incision proceeding to hernia repair by short celiotomy was chosen. Laparoscopy allows for location of herniated place and promotes the reduction of organs involved with minimal surgical trauma.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT We report a case of secondary skin lesionby infection with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in bovine. Abscesses and multiple nodular lesions, ranging from 8x10 to 20x25 cm in diameter, firm, sensitive to touch, and without mobility, some with ulcerated surface, surrounded by reddish halo and draining piosanguinolenta secretion, and other surfaces with alopecia, were identified in the skin of the animal`s thoracic area. Histopathology and isolation of the agent from fragments obtained after surgical removal of the lesions confirmed the cutaneous infection by C. pseudotuberculosis. Microscopic lesions were characterized by lumpy skin disease and ulcerative pyogranulomatous. Evaluation of in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial demonstrated that the agent was resistant to amikacin, kanamycin, neomycin and penicillin G, and sensitive to ampicillin + subactam, amoxicilia with clavulonic acid, cephalexin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, and tetracycline. The surgical removal of the lesions, and treatment with enrofloxacin resulted in animal cure. Skin lesions observed in case of ptiose, squamous cell carcinoma and atypical form of Actinobacillosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous form of C. pseudotuberculosis infection in cattle. The data presented demonstrate that infection with C. pseudotuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skin lesions in cattle in Brazil.",

In each group the animals were euthanized at seven, 28 and 42 days after surgery. Macroscopic and Histological analysis have been performed. At seven and 28 days after surgery the samples from both groups had urothelial lining upon a lamina propria and smooth muscle fibers in regeneration process. However, the TA group showed less inflammatory signs and more organized structure, mainly regarding the smooth muscle formation. At 42 days after surgery all groups showed a bladder wall structure qualitatively identical to the normal tissue. We could conclude that tunica albuginea graft is able to maintain bladder function and support cellular migration without any kind of rejection.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Fractures usually occur with overriding of bone fragments, thus hindering fracture reduction. The aim of this research was to develop and test a skeletal traction device for use in dogs with long bone fractures. Twenty-one dogs were included, regardless of breed or gender, weighing between two and 27kg, and between two months and 11 years of age, with metaphyseal or diaphyseal fractures that had occurred between three and 24 days prior to intervention. While fixation of the patient's body to the table was performed using nylon straps, the traction force applied along the bone axis of the fractured limb was performed using nylon straps or transfixed pins and stirrups (with the pins implanted in the distal epiphysis of the fractured bone). Tensile strength was measured by a dynamometer, and the maximum load applied was no greater than 25kg. In all cases, the distraction force began at five kilograms except in dogs below this weight, where the starting load was equivalent to the weight of the animal. If necessary, in all dogs, force was increased every five minutes to maintain equal traction to the dog's weight or values which ranged from the dog's weight to five kilograms depending on the size of the animal, until the necessary traction for reduction was obtained. For this progression of distension, the equipment had a 25-milimeter-diameter threaded rod, a nut with a rudder system and sliding cylinder outside the rod, which connected to the dog via a chain and the dynamometer. Fracture reduction was achieved in all dogs without bone loss, and the device was shown to be efficient in both allowing and maintaining fracture reduction, with no neurologic, vascular, cutaneous, or articular damage. The developed bone distractor has the following characteristics: simple to construct, low cost, does not harm the patient, and facilitates reduction of the fragments in recent and old fractures.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare different techniques of material sampling for endometrial cytology in mares, in order to verify possible qualitative and quantitative differences in the practicality of implementation of this methodology. Twelve multiparous mares underwent an endometrial cytological exam, during estrus and diestrus, by means of a cytobrush and a low-volume uterine flush. With this test, no statistical difference was observed (P>0.05) regarding the result of endometrial cytology between the evaluated techniques. However, in comparison to the estrous cycle's phases, a significant difference was verified (P<0.05) on the average percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils: 8.07±2.80 in estrus and 1.55±0.28 in diestrus. Thus, we conclude that the studied techniques presented equally effective results for the detection of neutrophils in the cytological exam for both evaluated stages of the estrous cycle, whereas in estrus phase, the detection of a higher percentage of neutrophils allows a more precocious diagnostic and prognostic of endometritis and, therefore, a more adequate therapeutic approach.",

From February 2010 to February 2016, 23 T. tetradactyla from the municipalities of Juazeiro (BA) Casa Nova (BA), Sento Sé (BA), Nonato (PI), Petrolina (PE), Great Pond (PE ) and Willow (PE), have been received and inspected to evaluate the presence of ticks, which were later collected with the help of anatomical tweezer and stored in tubes containing 70\% alcohol. The identification was carried out by observation of morphological characteristics in stereomicroscope and use of taxonomic keys. Approximately 8.69\% (2/23) of the animals had parasitism by ticks. The Ixodids were found fixed on ventral and cervical regions and were identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (five female), parasitizing the anteater 1 coming from Petrolina-PE; Amblyomma auricularium (one larva, 18 nymphs and a female) and Amblyomma sp. parasitizing the anteater 2 coming from Salgueiro-PE. This study reports the novel parasitism by larva of A. auricularium in T. tetradactyla in semiarid of Pernambuco ; and reaffirms the higher affinity of this ixodid by members of the superorder Xenarthra. It was possible to determine the parasitism of R. sanguineus s.l. in collared anteater, the which may be related to the sharing of the same habitat with domestic dogs infested. The parasitism of wild animals in new locations where they were not previously registered must be stimulated to expand the knowledge of the geographical distribution of ixodids in Brazil.",

Ten one-year-old dogs underwent computed tomography (CT). In sagittal reconstruction images of animals, the identification of 70 IVD present in the spaces between L3 - T9 were performed. Among calcified IVDs, the presence of the change was determined as the location in the nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus (AF) and both. Of a total of 70 evaluated IVDs, 45 were found to calcified and 25 not calcified. Among calcified discs, location was determined in nine (20\%) in NP, eight discs (17.77\%) in AF and 28 (62, 23\%) NP \& AF. Calcification in this study was characterized by increased radiographic attenuation mineral density in the IVD topography. There is variation in the location and radiodensity of calcified areas between animals and IVD in the same individual. Changes related to IVD calcification can be classified as tomographic location in AF, NP and NP \& AF.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The blood group system recognized for cats is AB. Antibodies against other blood types occur naturally in cats, which makes the compatibility tests and blood typing important for preventing transfusion reactions. Wild felids need blood transfusions in cases of diseases and when run over on highways. The aim of this study was to perform blood typing of eight jaguarundies (Puma yagouaroundi), eight ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), seven pampas cats (Leopardus colocolo), seven domestic cats (Felis catus) of Persian breed and eight non-pedigree domestic cats (Felis catus), and test compatibility among the different species with the same blood types, to evaluate the possibility of performing interspecific blood transfusions. We conducted the study from August to December. We used haemagglutination in test tubes for typing. The occurrence of blood type A was 100\% among ocelots, pampas cats and domestic cats of Persian breed, while non-pedigree domestic cats showed 85.72\%. The occurrence of type B was 100\% for jaguarundis and 14.28\% for non-pedigree domestic cats. Regarding blood compatibility tests, 87.5\% (n= 4) of the ocelots were incompatible with domestic cats; 100\% (n=6) of the pampas cats were compatible with domestic cats, while 100\% (n=4) of the jaguarundis were incompatible with type B domestic cats.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate and compare subjective sleep quality in medical students across the various phases of the medical course. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving medical undergraduates at one medical school in the city of Botucatu, Brazil. All first- to sixth-year students were invited to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which has been validated for use in Brazil. Participants were divided into three groups according to the phase of the medical course: group A (first- and second-years); group B (third- and fourth-years); and group C (fifth- and sixth-years). The results obtained for the instrument components were analyzed for the total sample and for the groups. Results: Of the 540 students invited to participate, 372 completed the instrument fully. Of those, 147 (39.5\%) reported their sleep quality to be either very or fairly bad; 110 (29.5\%) reported taking more than 30 min to fall asleep; 253 (68.0\%) reported sleeping 6-7 h per night; 327 (87.9\%) reported adequate sleep efficiency; 315 (84.6\%) reported no sleep disturbances; 32 (8.6\%) reported using sleeping medication; and 137 (36.9\%) reported difficulty staying awake during the day at least once a week. Group comparison revealed that students in group A had worse subjective sleep quality and greater daytime dysfunction than did those in groups B and C. Conclusions: Medical students seem to be more exposed to sleep disturbance than other university students, and first- and second-years are more affected than those in other class years because they have worse subjective sleep quality. Active interventions should be implemented to improve sleep hygiene in medical students.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: To assess the prevalence and describe the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment and outcome of children with cancer initially referred to a tertiary outpatient pediatric rheumatology clinic. Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records from patients identified in a list of 250 new patients attending the tertiary Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic, Ribeirão Preto Medical School hospital, University of São Paulo, from July 2013 to July 2015, whose final diagnosis was cancer. Results: Of 250 patients seen during the study period, 5 (2\%) had a cancer diagnosis. Among them, 80\% had constitutional symptoms, especially weight loss and asthenia, and 60\% had arthritis. Initially, all patients had at least one alteration in their blood count, lactate dehydrogenase was increased in 80\% and a bone marrow smear was conclusive in 60\% of patients. Bone and intestine biopsies were necessary for the diagnosis in 2 patients. JIA was the most common initial diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2 patients), M3 acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastoma (one case each). Of 5 patients studied, 3 (60\%) are in remission and 2 (40\%) died, one of them with prior use of steroids. Conclusion: The constitutional and musculoskeletal symptoms common to rheumatic and neoplastic diseases can delay the diagnosis and consequently worsen the prognosis of neoplasms. Initial blood count and bone marrow smear may be normal in the initial framework of neoplasms. Thus, the clinical follow-up of these cases becomes imperative and the treatment, mainly with corticosteroids, should be delayed until diagnostic definition.",

The second phase of the study consisted of the collection of electromyographic signals in the proposed exercises. For this, a series with loads adjusted to 90\% of 10 MR was performed. To verify the differences in the activation of the respective muscles studied between the BP and DP exercises the paired student's T-test was used for dependent samples. Results: No changes were observed in the activation of any of the muscles analyzed in the proposed exercises (P>0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that performing the pullover exercise with barbell or with dumbbell does not change the participation/activation of the involved muscles.",

Objective: To analyze the association between the screen type and time of exposure to the screen, the perception of sleep quality, and episodes of parasomnia in adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study that incorporates a school-based epidemiological survey with a representative sample (n=481) of high school students (14-19 years old) in the public education network of the city of Caruaru, PE. For the analysis of sleep and lifestyle, the translated and adapted version of the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS) was used. The binary logistic regression was used to analyze the association between the variables, considering the negative perception of sleep quality as an outcome. Results: The prevalence of negative perception of sleep quality was 58\% (95\% CI 53.5-62.3). Among the behaviors analyzed, it was found that sleeping eight hours or less per day and watching television more than two hours per day increased, respectively, 2.69 (95\% CI 1.61-4.71) and 1.71 (95\% CI 1.08-2.73) the chances of reporting negative perception of sleep. Excessive screen time, especially in front of TV, was associated with a greater number of episodes of parasomnia. Conclusion: Sleep quality is related both to the number of hours of sleep and to the time of exposure to TV. In addition, a greater number of episodes of parasomnia occurred among adolescents who watched more than three hours of TV per day.",

Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the acute effect of different warm-up times on flexibility, balance, and functional performance in physically active individuals. Method: Thirty two healthy men, who exercise regularly at least three times a week, were randomly assigned to one of four groups (n=8): G0 (without WU), G5 (WU for 5 min), G10 (WU for 10 min), and G15 (WU for 15 min). The subjects were assessed before and after the intervention on the following variables: flexibility of the rectus femoris (RF) and hamstrings (HM) muscles, body balance with open and close eyes and functional performance through triple horizontal jump (THJ) and shuttle run (SR) tests. The WU was carried out on a treadmill between 70\% and 80\% estimated maximum heart rate for age. Results: There were no significant differences in flexibility and balance in intra and intergroup comparisons (p>0.05). However, there was a significant improvement in functional performance only in G10 in the intragroup comparison for THJ variables (5.88±0.55 to 6.23±0.66; p=0.0051) and SR variables (4.72±0.13 to 4.61±0.13; p=0.0194) variables.

Objective: To compare the effects of a proprioceptive training and muscle strengthening training on ankle joint stability in female indoor soccer athletes through the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Methods: Twenty female indoor soccer athletes, aged between 18 and 30 years (mean 22.45 ± 3.30) with no history of lower limb injuries in the last six months were divided randomly into two groups. One group underwent proprioceptive training and the other a muscle strengthening protocol for four weeks. SEBT was used to evaluate the pre and post-intervention phases. For the comparison of means of both ankles in each isolated groups the t test was used for repeated measures. For the comparison of means between groups, the t test was applied for independent samples. The level of significance was set at 5 \% (p≤0.05) and statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 18. Results: Both proprioceptive training and muscle strengthening training obtained statistically significant results in lateral, posterior-lateral, posterior, posterior-medial and medial directions, demonstrating a good stability of the ankle joint for any of the protocols. When comparing the pre- and post-intervention between groups there were no statistically significant differences in any of test directions.

This type of treatment can bring physical and psychological changes to the life of the patients. Objective: To analyze the influence of the radical surgery and conservative surgery on the sitting time, body image and quality of life in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: Participated in the study 172 women who underwent radical or conservative breast cancer surgery. A questionnaire was applied including data that involved personal characteristics, anthropometric measures, economic status (IBGE), characteristics of the disease, sitting time (IPAQ - short version), body image (BIBCQ) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 + QLQ BR - 23). For statistical analysis the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, Student T test for independent samples, and Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results: Patients who underwent radical surgery had longer sitting times at weekends, more reports of lymphedema, worse quality of life scores (physical function, pain, functional scale, body image and arm symptoms), and worse body image (vulnerability, stigma, limitations, transparency, and concerns about the arm). Conclusion: The type of surgery can influence sitting time and aspects of body image and quality of life, with worse scores for women undergoing radical surgery.",

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and habits of male athletes, members of the Brazilian Football and Basketball Confederations, about the interrelationship between oral health and sport. Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was developed, consisting of sixteen objective questions and one essay question, which were answered by 42 soccer athletes and 40 basketball athletes. The athletes were questioned on their knowledge about the use of mouthguards during sports practice, interferences of oral changes in sports performance, use of drugs for dental purposes and doping. They were also asked about the history of trauma during sports practice, use of mouthguards, supplements, isotonic or energy drinks intake, temporomandibular joint changes and participation in oral health program in the home club. Results: The results showed that the athletes interviewed do not have adequate knowledge about the influence of oral health on sports practice, although they agree that dental professionals contribute to the maintenance of oral health and the consequent improvement in sports performance. It was also observed that basketball athletes reported a higher percentage of trauma compared to soccer athletes. Most athletes of both modalities reported the use of sports drinks, but do not make use of dietary supplements and not being a mouth-breather. Conclusion: There is a need to disseminate the importance of oral health in sports to maintain systemic health and to improve sports practice.",

This article aims to present and discuss elements extracted from doctoral theses of the Medicine College of the University of São Paulo (Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo) in the 1920s, specifically related to the theme of mendelist eugenics from the point of view of that period's scientific production. The chosen span represents a moment of great influence of medicine in society, because of actions of control and normalization of individuals, influenced by eugenic theories. The doctoral theses represent the beginning of the College's student production and contain influences from theories in vogue of the period - evolutionist, positivist and eugenic theories. Eight doctoral theses were selected for presentation in this article, and they were analyzed from the concept of representation as document reading technique. In these theses, one can observe the concern of the authors with the formation of eugenic descent, defending the establishment of measures such as restriction to marriages, prenuptial medical examination and, in some cases, compulsory sterilization.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The ability to make site-specific modifications to the human genome has been an objective in medicine since the recognition of the gene as the basic unit of heredity. Thus, gene therapy is understood as the ability of genetic improvement through the correction of altered (mutated) genes or site-specific modifications that target therapeutic treatment. This therapy became possible through the advances of genetics and bioengineering that enabled manipulating vectors for delivery of extrachromosomal material to target cells. One of the main focuses of this technique is the optimization of delivery vehicles (vectors) that are mostly plasmids, nanostructured or viruses. The viruses are more often investigated due to their excellence of invading cells and inserting their genetic material. However, there is great concern regarding exacerbated immune responses and genome manipulation, especially in germ line cells. In vivo studies in in somatic cell showed satisfactory results with approved protocols in clinical trials. These trials have been conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia and China. Recent biotechnological advances, such as induced pluripotent stem cells in patients with liver diseases, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy, and genomic editing by CRISPR/Cas9, are addressed in this review.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT At the present there is no longer any doubt about the importance of human sciences and humanities in the medical curriculum. This is already a consensus. It is necessary to resume at least partially the ability of future doctors to empathize and communicate as in the past in addition to the systemic view so that patients can feel better welcomed which is very well illustrated in the text of the doctor Tatiana Bruscky produced by Ria Slides: ``Onde andará o meu doutor''4. However, finding a systematized way of working on these concepts still does not exist despite the initiatives that have been taking place in Brazil, especially after 2014, since the Curriculum Guidelines for undergraduate courses in Medicine have inserted even more aspects related to this medical / patient communication. Introducing these subjects and discussions in the teaching of medical courses is a difficult task since almost always dosing theory and practice and making the disciplines attractive and valued by the students is a great challenge. There are no clear parameters or detailed descriptions of the methodologies used only brief reports. This article seeks to address in detail one of the ways of teaching humanities in the Centro Universitário Lusíada (Unilus) medical course, describing the step-by-step methodology, experience and some results since its implementation in 2010 with a Station called Communication belonging to the discipline of Practical Skills. It is developed in the first three years. In the first year the focus is the communication between doctor and patient/family in different consultation situations. The second year is the communication of bad news while in the third the focus is the communication of pre and postoperative. In that way students can train and reflect through simulations a wide range of cases and contexts from the simplest to the most complex. The purpose is to share applied didactics and stimulate the discussion and exchange of experience among interested professionals committed to excellence in medical education.",

Objective: To identify the perception of graduates on the acquisition of abilities and competencies considered in the pedagogical project of a medical course. Methods: A cross-sectional study was developed with 229 graduates from a medical program carried out between 2005 and 2012, at Universidade Anhanguera-Uniderp in Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The study involved the application of a self-administered questionnaire including 34 competencies and abilities, assessed through a Likert scale, from April to July 2013. Results: Regarding the acquisition of general competences, ``good'' or ``very good'' answers were found for most of the studied items. For the competency regarding communication, most of the ``very good'' answers were found in the domains ``being capable of interacting with other health professionals'' (60\%) and ``being capable of maintaining information confidentiality'' (68\%). As for specific competencies, the majority of the graduates referred to the acquisition of most domains as ``good'' or ``very good''. The domains ``using scientifically validated therapeutic and diagnostic procedures'' and ``mastering knowledge in physiopathology, treatment and rehabilitation of prevalent diseases'' had the highest indices of ``good'' answers, 62\% and 59\%, respectively. As regards the acquisition of complementary competencies, the domains concerning general and specific practices, such as ``establishing a physician-patient relationship'', ``performing a physical exam correlating it to anatomical references'' and ``performing a general and segmentary physical exam'' achieved a greater percentage of positive answers (good or very good). The domains regarding ``performing a special neurological exam'', ``performing a special orthopedic exam'' and ``immobilizing fractures'' presented negative and regular answers, which when combined corresponded to 49\%, 69\% and 83\%, respectively. Conclusions: The present study served as a basis for changes in the course, providing resources for improving the quality of education and meeting the graduates' needs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The psychological distress suffered by medical students is well-known. The role of the teaching staff in detecting difficulties causing students psychological distress and their knowledge of how to handle them is fundamental for preventing such problems. However, medical teachers are not always prepared to deal with these challenges. Objective: To study the perception of the teaching staff of the medical school at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (FMUFMG) concerning the psychological distress of the students. Method: A cross-sectional quantitative study carried out with the faculty of the UFMG medical school. The sample of 102 teachers was obtained by random draw and divided into four groups: males with up to ten (10) years of teaching, males with more than ten (10) years, females with up to ten (10) years of teaching, and females with more than ten (10)years. A self-applied 28-item questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree was prepared. For the data analysis four indicators were elaborated: psychological distress perception indicator (IPSP), commitment of the teacher to the student emotional difficulties indicator (ICDE), performance in the face of psychological distress indicator (IAPS) and a general indicator (IG). Quartile analysis was carried out and the difference among the groups was calculated using nonparametric tests. Five questions that were not included in the indicators were independently analyzed. Results: Seven teachers refused to participate and 79 answers were collected. The results showed varying degrees of concern among the groups in relation to the psychological distress of students. For the IG, the female teachers with longer teaching experience obtained a higher median in relation to the men with less teaching experience (p<0.05). For the other indicators, despite the difference between the quartiles, the comparison of the medians showed no statistically significant differences. For questions not included in the indicators, it was shown that 85\% of the sample had perceived psychological distress among their students. Male teachers more frequently deny psychological distress among students. 16.5\% of the teachers did not know of any instances of institutional psychological care. The occurrence of bullying failed to be noted by more than 50\% of the teachers. Only 28\% of the teachers admitted that their actions or attitudes could precipitate a student's psychological distress. When questioned about emotional support for teachers, 75.9\% would appreciate some institutional support. Conclusion: The present study, despite its limitations, is unique in assessing the perception of the medical teaching staff in relation to the psychological distress of the students. Teaching experience and being female seem to play an important role in the teacher's perception of psychological distress among students. A significant portion of the teaching staff ignores the existence of psychological support programs for students.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT A new type of doctor-patient relationship is emerging due to the widespread use of social media. Therefore, a review of certain aspects of medical education is needed in order to preserve the trust and cooperation of the doctor-patient relationship. Objectives: To describe the online behaviour of medical students, their opinions the use of social media and to understand aspects of undergraduate medical training regarding ethics and professionalism. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 260 medical students enrolled in the fifth and sixth years at three medical schools in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The data were collected between August 2015 and July 2016 at the teaching hospitals of each medical school. This paper reports the results from a structured questionnaire composed by the authors about online ethics and professionalism and answered by the students. The obtained data were analysed by means of the following statistical tests: Pearson's Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis and McNemar tests. For the Likert scale-type part of the questionnaire average ranking was calculated for student responses. Cronbach Alpha was also calculated. The study was approved by the Ethics on Research Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. In order to ensure the confidentiality of the results, the medical schools had their names omitted. Results: A total of 84 students (32.3\%) reported that they had posted pictures or videos with patients and 108 (41.5\%) had posted pictures or videos with alcoholic drinks or cigarettes. A statistically significant difference (p<0.001) was found between the three medical schools relative to students posting pictures or videos with patients. The students from institution number III were the least likely to post photos or videos with patients or with alcoholic drinks or cigarettes, according to their answers to the questionnaire. Furthermore, institution number III also had the highest number of students that reported having addressed issues of online professionalism in medical training (26.2\%/22). Analysing the three institutions separately an inverse relationship was found between ``posting photos or videos with patients'' and ``online professionalism during undergraduate training''. Among those surveyed, 79\% (205) agreed that some content published by doctors on Facebook might harm the doctor's reputation. Students reported having had no discussions concerning online professionalism during their undergraduate course in 80.8\% of the cases. Analysing the curriculum from the three medical schools, only institution number III was found to offer specific content regarding professional development and formally addressed theories regarding concepts of ethics during the medical residency. Conclusion: When we consider the recommendations found in the Code of Medical Ethics, resolutions published by the Brazilian Federal Medical Council (BFMC), and foreign guidelines, it was evident that a large number of students had posted inappropriate content online. A failure to adequately address ethics and professionalism as part of academic training may well play a part in issues related to the behaviour of medical students on social meda. More research into online behaviour and ethics/professionalism taught as part of undergraduate training is needed to infer causal relationships. Finally, it could be concluded that online professionalism was a topic that was scarcely addressed in the curricula of the surveyed medical schools",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This article points out the deficiency of medical courses in relation to Humanities and argues that the study of Bioethics — a discipline that seeks to integrate the Human and Biological Sciences — can help fill this harmful gap. We present the Convergent Bioethics of Ricardo Maliandi and Oscar Thüer as a valuable theoretical framework able to help physicians to solve or minimize ethical conflicts inherent to their professional practice, without undue unilateralism. Comparing its theoretical foundation with the well-known proposal of Beauchamp and Childress we point out the advantages of the former. We showcase its applicability with the analysis of potential ethical conflicts inferred from information obtained from medical records of a patient admitted tothe Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro. To that end, medical literature was studied in search of probabilistic data about the disease in question (esophageal cancer with fistula, complicated by pulmonary septic shock), noting that these data can help toward gaining a better understanding of the prognosis, but cannot be used by the medical team as support for unilateral decisions about therapeutic limitations. Reading Azoulay's work regarding patients with diseases with poor prognosis who eventually find themselves in intensive care, we highlight his proposal for difficult cases from an ethical point of view, recognizing and demonstrating its compatibility with the Convergent Bioethics of Maliandi and Thüer. This is a theoretical essay on therapeutic limitation, in which we seek to link the literature's foundation to real-case applicability of a critical patient. We believe that this article could be a starting point for the dissemination of Convergent Ethics - developed by the philosopher Ricardo Maliandi and explained with the aid of the physician Oscar Thüer as refers to bioethics — in medical courses, bringing more security and less loneliness in the difficult decision-making process inherent to the relationship between physicians and patient/family, particularly with regard to end of life medical care.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to translate, validate and evaluate a British specialty choice inventory. This tool processes the answers to 130 items and returns a 59-medical specialty ranking, in decreasing order of recommendation, based on the candidate's profile adjustments to specialty characteristics. The top 10 and the bottom 10 recommendations are considered positive and negative ones, respectively. Translation and semantic adaptation followed the standard procedures described in the specialized literature, and resulted in a Brazilian Portuguese version named SCIB (Special Choice Inventory — Brasil). The best version of each translated item was chosen. SCIB was then applied to 120 Brazilian physicians (85 specialists and 35 residents) representing 38 different specialties. SCIB was also applied to 79 senior medical students. Participant physicians indicated in a structured questionnaire two specialties they could have chosen apart from the current one, as well as three specialties they would unlikely choose. SCIB was regarded as adequate or very adequate to the Brazilian conditions by 85.8\% (103/120) of the physicians and 73.4\% (58/79) of the students. Among the latter, 60.8\% (48/79) regarded the inventory useful or very useful. For the physicians, SCIB positive recommendations included their current specialty in 67.5\% (81/120) of the cases, and any of the specialties they could have chosen in 72.5\% (87/120) of the cases. SCIB negative recommendations included any of the specialties that participants would unlikely choose in 87.5\% (105/120) of the cases. The translation and adaptation procedures provided data for SCIB validation concerning the face, content and semantic aspects. Answers from the 120 physicians and data from a test-retest study involving 40 participants showed that SCIB has satisfactory levels of homogeneity, internal consistency and reproducibility. In conclusion, translation and adaptation for use in Brazil of the Sci59, a British inventory for assisting medical specialty choice, was successful and resulted in the, SCIB, a tool whose performance was very satisfactory. SCIB can thus be seen as a promising tool for assisting medical specialty choice, as well as for research in this field.",

Most of the publications were found in Conselho Federal de Medicina (CFM) and Federação Brasileira dos Médicos (Fenam), being 44\% in each site. `More Medical Program' and `Medical Movement' were the most frequent themes in the publications, which expressed opposition of the entities to the policies established by the Federal Government before the impeachment. The results indicate that EM advocate corporate interests, deviating themselves from the principles and guidelines inherent to the Brazilian Health Reform.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT: The bioprinting is considered a promising source in cell development, and production of mini-organs, valves, cartilage that may eventually be used in therapy for transplantation in animals and humans. It can also be used as an elective therapy in the treatment of injuries and treatment of chronic degenerative diseases. In humans, this therapy is been studied mainly in the treatment and regeneration of tissues printed from scaffold cells developed from stem cells, biomaterials and impressions in 3D. This technology is also an aid for the study of the formation of tumors, in order to design and evaluate the cellular proliferation of the tumors and the action of new chemotherapy drugs. However, the main drawback to this therapy is the lack of standardized protocols with reproducible and detailed methodologies with the aim of enabling the use of bioprinting and printing cells, tissues and organs in 3D. Thus, this review seeks to bring together the most current publications of the bioprinting area in order to describe the technique and its potential use as a therapeutic alternative.",

 abstract = "Abstract Background: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation tends to reduce mortality. However, it requires medium/long-term adherence to regular physical exercise. It is relevant to identify the variables that affect adherence to an supervised exercise program (SEP). Objective: To evaluate the influence of pre-participation levels of aerobic and non-aerobic physical fitness components in medium-term adherence to SEP. Methods: A total of 567 SEP participants (65 ± 12 years) (68\% men) were studied. Participants adherent to the program for less than 6 months (48\%) (non-adherent - NAD) were compared with 52\% of participants who were adherent for 6 months or more (adherents - AD). In the non-aerobic fitness, flexibility (FLX) (Flexitest) and muscle power (MPW)/body weight in standing rowing (watts/kg) were evaluated while aerobic fitness was obtained by direct measure of VO2max/body weight (VO2). These measurements were normatized for sex and age based on percentiles (P) (P-FLX/P-MPW) of reference data or percentages of predicted (P-VO2). Additionally, AD and NAD with extreme results (tertiles) were simultaneously compared for the three variables. Results: There was no difference between AD and NAD for non-aerobic results, in median [P25-P75], P-FLX: 30 [13-56] and 31 [9-52], respectively, (p = 0.69) and P-MPW: 34 [17-58] and 36 [16-62], respectively (p = 0.96), and for aerobic results (mean ± standard error) P-VO2 (75.9 ± 1.3\% and 75.0 ± 1.3\%, respectively) (p = 0.83). When comparing extreme tertiles, a difference was found for P-MPW in the lower tertile only, with a slight advantage of AD over NAD- 9 [5-16] versus 4 [1-11] (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Although awareness of the pre-participation levels of aerobic and non-aerobic physical fitness components is useful for individualized exercise prescription, these variables do not seem to influence medium-term adherence to SEP.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the automated technique for blood cells count of ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), comparing it with the manual technique. Blood samples were collected from eight ocelots, which were submitted to counting of erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and packed cell volume by the standard manual method and by the device VET ® 2800 BC with the configuration for domestic cats. The results were evaluated using the t test for paired data and the techniques submitted to Pearson correlation. The automated technique showed statistically similar results to erythrocytes and leukocytes. Significant difference was found only for packed cell volume between the manual and automated techniques, but the correlation was high. Although there was no significant difference between the techniques for platelets, the correlation was low. We concluded that the 2800 BC VET ® device with the configuration for domestic cats is a reliable technique in performing the erythrocyte and leukocyte counts for ocelots. The device may be used to determine packed cell volume, provided the correction is made. The manual technique is recommended for the platelet count.",

Four intra-articular injections with kartogenin (20mM) were performed weekly in one stifle (treated group). The same procedure using saline solution was performed in the contralateral joint (control group). Clinical, radiographic, ultrasound evaluations were performed for a period of 60 days. No statistical differences were detected between groups in any of the studied variables. Although kartogenin has shown to improve articular cartilage repair in laboratory animal models, the same was not observed in this equine model. In conclusion, the kartogenin therapy, according to the used protocol, did not promote any clinical benefit in equine femoral trochlear defects pretreated with subcondral drilling.",

In the third, seventh, 14th and 21st postoperative days wounds were biopsied for microscopic evaluation of inflammation and repair process indicators, especially collagen, in picrosirius staining, and cell proliferation, in AgNOR staining. There was a greater deposition of collagen fibers in groups B and CB (p=0.00003) on the seventh day and formation of thicker crusts, and more organized collagen fibers on the 21st day in these groups. In conclusion, in the initial phase of healing, barbatiman extract stimulates the production of collagen fibers and promotes the formation of more exuberant crusts on the wounds and remodeling phase favors the orientation of collagen fibers, but when combined with BMMC does not stimulate wound healing in rabbits.",

Therefore, further study of this region is of interest when it comes to diagnosis and treatment of lameness in horses. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the differences between the imaging findings of ultrasonography and computed tomography in the evaluation of the palmar structures of the podotrochlear apparatus of healthy adult horses and description of the structures observed in images obtained with these techniques. For this, four images of four anatomical parts were performed, and subsequently sectioned and used for the anatomical description. The use of anatomical parts helps in the understanding of normal anatomy leading to a better interpretation of the images and increasing the specificity of the diagnostic for detecting changes that cause diseases. Ultrasonography provides relevant information about these structures to be studied and the association with computed tomography (CT) increased the accuracy of the investigation. Despite the use of CT being more suitable for bone tissue it provides important information and can be used as a useful tool when there is no available MRI.",

Clinically, cerebellar hypoplasia was suspected and the animal was euthanized due to poor prognosis. During necropsy, gross lesions were not observed. Microscopically the lesions were restricted to the cerebellum and were characterized by neurodegenerative and necrotic damage with segmental disappearance of the Purkinje cells. In these areas, there were also empty spaces, called the empty basket aspect, resulting from the loss of Purkinje cells, as well as rare axonal spheroids and proliferation of Bergmann's astrocytes. In some areas, the granular layer was hypocellular and there was moderate multifocal gliosis in the molecular layer. The diagnosis of cerebellar abiotrophy was based on epidemiological, clinical and mainly on histopathological changes in neurons of Purkinje disease characteristics.",

Twelve dogs, were randomly allocated in two groups (n=6) who received constant rate infusion (CRI) of midazolam (0,5mg/kg/h), fentanyl (10µg/kg/h) and propofol (18mg/kg/h) in GMF or ketamine (0,6 mg/kg/h), morphine (0,26mg/kg/h) and propofol (18mg/kg/h) in GCM, during 24 hours. The dogs were mechanically ventilated to normocapnia with FiO2 of 40\%. Heart rate decreased 32\% in GMF and 34\% in GCM during infusion time reducing CI in 24\% at GMF and 29\% at GCM. CaO2, CmvO2, DO2 and VO2 decreased in GCM (5\%, 16\%, 31\% and 7\% respectively) and GMF (4\%, 19\%, 26\% and 15\% respectively). Extraction ratio increased 32\% in GMF and 36\% in GCM without differences between groups; however, decreased VO2, evaluated for indirect calorimetry, suggests minimization of DO2 reduction. No differences between time to extubation, sternal recumbency and total recovery time were observed between groups, with an average of 33,8±15,9, 134,8±60,7 e 208±77,5 minutes respectively. We conclude that both protocols allowed mechanical ventilation with IC and DO2 reduction without metabolic and hemodynamic impairment, and can be safely used in healthy dogs.",

Aiming to evaluate the effect of equine pituitary extract (EPE) on superovulation, the experiment was conducted using six mares Purebred Arabian in two estrous cycles (control and treatment). The mares were synchronized, and monitored daily by ultrasound B mode until the follicles reached diameter ≤ 23 mm (deviation). In the treatment cycle, from the deviation, mares received 8 mg of EPE, once a day, intramuscularly, until two or more follicles reached a diameter between 32 and 35 mm. Ovulation was induced with deslorelin acetate when follicles reached at least 35 mm. At the time of follicular deviation, induction of ovulation and final preovulatory exam, it was used B-mode ultrasound to measure the diameter of follicles and on the eighth day after ovulation to measure the area of the corpus luteum (CL); color Doppler was also used to assess blood perfusion of the follicle wall and luteal parenchyma. In the control cycle was performed the same procedure except for the use of EPE. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, with 5\% significance level. There was no effect of EPE on ovulation number, diameter of follicles, vascularity of the follicular wall and serum estrogen concentration. The animals treated or not, showed functional CLs, with no difference in parenchymal area or luteal vascularization, or in serum progesterone concentration on the eighth day after ovulation. It was observed that the EPE provided a greater number of subordinate follicles at the time of induction of ovulation of the dominant follicle. Although these follicles have failed to ovulate, it was concluded that EPE influenced the follicles growth, and it can be used in other biotechnologies, with greater utilization of equine ovarian follicular reserve.",

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 81 kidney transplant patients who had undergone transplantation between 30 and 60 months previously. Patients were followed up for 12 months. The analysis was carried out in a large public hospital in the countryside of São Paulo, Brazil. Based on the Duke University Religion Index-religiosity and spirituality scale, we divided patients into two groups (spiritualized [n=52] and less spiritualized [n=29]), considering the median spirituality. For statistical analysis, we used inductive tests and analysis with linear mixed models, with a level of significance of 5\% (p<0.05). Results: Clinical characteristics, immunosuppression, social support, adherence to drug therapy, quality of life, and depression did not differ between groups. Renal function after 12 months was significantly higher in the spiritualized group from 9 months on. After 12 months, the percentage of patients with creatinine clearance higher than 60 ml/min was 61.5\% in the spiritualized group and 34.5\% in the less spiritualized group (p=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that the less spiritualized group had a 4.7 times greater risk [1.4 – 16.8] for worsening in renal function (p=0.01). Conclusion: More spiritualized patients had better renal function after 1 year of transplantation. This result was independent of clinical features, social support, and adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. A holistic approach in health with emphasis on spirituality is encouraged.",

In these times of grave political and institutional crisis in Brazil and in the year of the first National Conference on Health Surveillance (1ª CNVS, acronym in Portuguese), it is particularly appropriate to revive the critical theoretical and epistemological discussions that have grounded the trajectory of Latin American social medicine and public health over the last 40 years. To this end, I draw on aspects of critical thinking on modernity devised by the Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos, who postulates three pillars of domination: capitalism, colonialism (or coloniality), and patriarchy. In the current context of a crisis of civilization, rethinking emancipation requires us to refresh our understanding of the meaning of social struggles in terms of their relationship with the knowledges and epistemologies undermined by modern civilization and still present in the Global South, whether in spaces occupied by indigenous peoples and poor farmers or in urban peripheries.",

The epidemiology service has combined epidemiological surveillance, continuing education, in-service training, research, and health service evaluation since 1986. The service is part of the national epidemiological surveillance network and was responsible for the notification of 55,747 cases between 1986 and 2016, most of which were the result of active search. The integration of various levels of health surveillance and health care makes classical control activities more agile and provides instruments for measuring. The important role played by the service in human resources training is evident in the training of 1,835 medical interns and 78 residents up to 2016. In addition, this experience has served as the basis for the implantation of several other hospital epidemiological surveillance units. Current challenges include the promotion of effective communication and coordination among the other health surveillance committees.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: to describe and evaluate the acceptance of a porcine experimental model in venous cutdown on a medical education project in Southwest of Brazil. Method: a porcine experimental model was developed for training in venous cutdown as a teaching project. Medical students and resident physicians received theoretical training in this surgical technique and then practiced it on the model. After performing the procedure, participants completed a questionnaire on the proposed model. This study presents the model and analyzes the questionnaire responses. Results: the study included 69 participants who used and evaluated the model. The overall quality of the porcine model was estimated at 9.16 while the anatomical correlation between this and human anatomy received a mean score of 8.07. The model was approved and considered useful in the teaching of venous cutdown. Conclusions: venous dissection training in porcine model showed good acceptance among medical students and residents of this institution. This simple and easy to assemble model has potential as an educational tool for its resemblance to the human anatomy and low cost.",

An 8-year-old mule was observed at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, presenting papular-crusted and pruritic cutaneous lesions with clinical evolution of two years. In three previous situations, the disease had been treated as fungal dermatitis by other veterinarians. For the diagnosis, cytopathological and parasitological examination of the skin, bacteriological and fungal culture, histopathological analysis and blood count were performed. The exams showed a chronic eosinophilic perivascular superficial dermatitis. A topical therapy with dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfadiazine, urea, and vitamin A was indicated. The therapeutic protocol was satisfactory, allowing complete remission of the clinical condition. This work reported clinical and pathological findings of allergic dermatitis to the bites of Culicoides spp. in muar, in addition to alerting about the importance of complementary examinations for the accomplishment of the differential diagnosis and adequate therapeutic orientation.",

Leukocytes pattern was characterized by leukocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis and eosinopenia around calving. Lymphocytosis and high proportions of B cells CD21+ were a constant finding between week -2 and +3, thus cows were tested and confirmed seropositive for BLV. The values of T lymphocytes subsets were low during the transition period, observing two peaks that coincided with high levels of cortisol at delivery (2.11µg/dL) and week +3 (1.97µg/dL). Hp had gradual increase from week -2 (166µg/mL) until week +3 (576g/mL) probably due to high rate of uterine infection detected between week +2 and +3. The seropositive cows for BLV presented stress leukogram around delivery, except for lymphocytes. Lymphocytosis and the high proportions of B cells, associated with the low proportions of T lymphocytes, can be indicative of immunosuppression and predisposition to the inflammatory process observed in the post-partum period.",

Twelve adult Rottweilers were used and subjected to the echocardiography examination without the use of sedation (control - CT) and subjected to three treatment protocols using meperidine (MT), acepromazine (AT), and the combination of drugs (MAT). Variables were analyzed by Tukey test (p<0,05). The averages obtained in A-wave of mitral inflow in AT and MAT decreased significantly compared to MT, which did not differ from CT. There was a significant decrease in the measurement of mitral annulus motion (MAM) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) at TA. There was no significant difference in shortening fraction (SF) values between TA and other treatments. However, it was observed that 57.3\% of the dogs showed SF values below the normal range for the species. All changes found may be due to the hypotensive effects of acepromazine used in isolation. In conclusion, meperidine or its association with acepromazine does not alter echocardiographic parameters in healthy dogs and acepromazine, used alone, causes changes in the parameters of systolic function and is not recommended for sedation of dogs submitted to echocardiogram, since it could cause a misinterpretation of the exam.",

Clinical signs most commonly associated with this clinical feature are paresis, paraplegia, tetraparesis, tetraplegia, which may lead the patient to a comatose state, and even death. Fortunately, these clinical signs can be perceived during physical examination. All of which, alongside imaging techniques, may allow a precise diagnose of the location of lesions and prediction of a prognosis for the patient. We present a case report of a Mangalarga mare, with four years of age, presenting signs of post-traumatic tetraplegia with spastic paralysis with increased muscular tonus and hyperreflexia in all four limbs. A thorough neurological examination of the patient associated with conventional and contrast medium radiographic imaging of the cervical region identified lesions at the atlas (C1) and axis (C2, and fifth (C5) and sixth (C6) cervical vertebrae. Fracture of the atlas vertebrae, dislocation of the axis' dens as well as subluxation of C5-C6 causing ventrodorsal medullary compression of the spinal cord were diagnosed radiographically. Due to the extent of the lesions the animal was euthanatized with the owner's consent. All lesions identified radiographically were posteriorly confirmed during post-mortem examination.",

A parallel was made with histochemical techniques of Masson's trichrome, Picrosirius Red under polarized light and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS). Twenty four uterine biopsies received by the Veterinary Pathology Service and Animal Reproduction of FMVZ, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, were diagnosed with endometriosis. Histological analysis revealed that the orange dense collagen fibers correspond to type I collagen, being prevalent in inactive and inactive destructive endometriosis. The green loose collagen fibers correspond to type III collagen, and are predominant in active and active destructive endometriosis. In the same processes, a greater amount of periglandular myofibroblasts were observed in comparison to inactive and inactive destructive endometriosis. The presence of these cells in active processes are strongly related to an increased deposition of collagen type III in fibrotic nests. Regarding the basement membrane, the active destructive and active endometriosis shows thickening, apparently not related to an increase in expression of type IV collagen. The active destructive and inactive destructive endometriosis exhibited disruption areas in type IV collagen fibers. Thus, it is noted that the myofibroblasts are related to increased deposition of type III collagen in active fibrotic nests.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This work aimed at demonstrating that an inadequate radiographic position of pelvic limbs of dogs, from a strict lateral radiographic view, resulted in oblique images, affecting the measurement of the tibial plateau angle (TPA). There were two radiographic projections of the right and the left pelvic limb, one in strict lateral radiographic view and another with inclined hind limb in 21 dogs from the clinical surgical assistance at Hospital Veterinário of Universidade de Cuiabá in Cuiabá-MT. Inclusion criteria were dogs free from pelvic hind limbs orthopedic affection records, weighing between 15 and 40 kilos, without a preference for breed or gender and ageing between two and seven years old. A total of 42 radiographic images in strict lateral radiographic view and 42 inclined limb radiographic views were obtained. Three observers with TPA calculation experience made measurements. In the calculus for the strict lateral radiographic view the first observer has reached an average of 23,35º ± 2,82, the second observer 23,88º ± 4,83 and the third observer 24,54º ± 4,01. No significant statistic differences among the calculus of the three evaluators p=0,944 (P>0,05) was found. In the calculus of the inclined limbs radiographic views the first observer reached an average of 21,69º ± 4,22, the second observer 19,42º ± 5,92 and the third observer 22,64º ±. 5,23. Significant statistic difference in the calculus of the three observers, p=0,016, that is to say, P<0,05 was found. The data indicated that the inclined limb radiographic image compromises the final value of the calculation of tibial plateau angle in dogs. Thus, correct positioning of the pelvic limb, in a strict lateral radiographic view, must be always used for obtaining images aiming at measuring the value of TPA.",

After 15 minutes, anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.46±0.79 mL) and maintained with isofluorane. Ovariohysterectomy was performed and cardiorespiratory variables were registered 15 minutes after pre-anesthetic medication (M0), 15 minutes after anesthetic induction (M15), and every five minutes until the end of the surgical procedure (M20, M25, M30, M35 e M40). Pain evaluation started 30 minutes after the surgery (MP30) and sequentially at thirty-minute intervals (MP60, MP90, MP120). After MP120, each evaluation was registered at every hour (MP180, MP240 e MP360). Dexmedetomidine-midazolam association results in decreases on initial heart rate (HR) without clinical relevance and it is related to pronounced sedation, poor and less durable antinociception and vomiting events, when compared to tramadol-midazolam association. Both protocols indicate cardiorespiratoy stability and safety in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.",

Clinical evaluations were performed on days 0, 3, 5 and 7 and the histopathology on days 5 and 7. In the proposed methodology, the use of ADSCs increased vascularization, formation of granulation tissue, collagen deposition and increases the number of hair follicles in just seven days of evaluation.

The study was prospective and cross-sectional, conducted in dogs treated at the Teaching Veterinary Medicine Hospital of the Universidade Federal Fluminense (HUVET-UFF) and private clinics in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Gastroduodenal mucosal samples were obtained by endoscopic biopsy and were processed by routine histological technique and stained with hematoxylin- eosin and Giemsa. The samples were submitted to histopathological analysis for the detection of spiral bacteria suggestive of Helicobacter spp. The rapid urease test was also performed. The clinical signs, the macro and microscopic findings were compared and correlated. In this study, we established a positive correlation between weight loss and the presence of erythema in the antrum, body and duodenum as well as correlation between change in appetite and the presence of gastric inflammatory infiltrate and positivity in the urease test. This study demonstrated the importance of the observation of some clinical signs such as weight loss and appetite changes in the course of IBD. Thus, it is emphasized that dogs showing these clinical signs should have the IBD included in the differential diagnoses group avoiding thereby neglecting a disease that increasingly affects small animals.",

A reduction of lipid droplets was observed in embryos cultured in medium supplemented with CLA compared to embryos cultured in the FCS in the absence and presence of CLA (P 0.05). Only one pregnancy was observed in early and confirmatory diagnosis, as the result of a Control group embryo transfer.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: In many cases, augmentation rhinoplasty is more difficult than reduction rhinoplasty. Solid dorsal grafts performed with costal cartilage have been widely used for dorsal augmentation; however, they are associated with high rates of revision. Thus, many authors began to use cartilage cut into cubes wrapped in fascia. The mastoid fascia, connected to the perichondrium of the auricular conchal cartilage can form a composite graft to augment the nasal dorsum, which is also a treatment option. The objective is to demonstrate the possibility of using fragmented auricular conchal cartilage fixed to its perichondrium and wrapped in mastoid fascia to form a composite graft for augmentation of the nasal dorsum. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 9 patients who underwent operation between 2012 and 2016 at the Base Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of São José do Rio Preto, in which the nasal dorsum was augmented with fragmented conchal cartilage fixed to its perichondrium and wrapped in the mastoid fascia. Results: The patients were followed up for up 6 to 48 months. They were questioned about their satisfaction with the nasal procedure and hearing sensitivity, and provided a positive evaluation of the surgeons. Conclusion: The conchal cartilage seems a highly valuable alternative graft for nasal dorsum augmentation procedures. The technique of using cartilage wrapped in mastoid fascia seems to be an advantageous alternative when compared with those using cartilage wrapped in other fasciae: it has low morbidity and complications rates and can be a great option for saddle nose treatment.",

Objective: The objective of this work was to seek national laws, as well as normative and resolutions issued by professional councils, aiming to address such controversies, enlightening professionals to the legitimacy of the procedure. Results: Since 1978, the Federal Councils of Medicine and Dentistry have issued resolutions to determine thresholds for professional performance, which particularly focused on Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology because it is the closest clinical dental specialty of medical practice. Over time, these Councils have been updating these resolutions, considering the technical and scientific advances of the area, but all the resolutions analyzed were unanimous in affirming that the accomplishment of bichectomy with a strictly aesthetic purpose is a medical attribution. Conclusion: Subsequently, based on the documents currently in force, it is verified that the dental surgeon who is willing to perform bichectomy surgery for aesthetic purposes will be incur administrative infractions and, consequently, such interpretations can be seen in other legal areas (civil and criminal).",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, the medical course does not provide complete education and handling of pain, and it is also devoid of disciplines addressing thanatology in palliative care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge about pain and palliative care of medical students and their perception on how these themes are taught the graduation course. METHODS: We invited to participate in the survey students of the medical school who are concluding the fourth, fifth and sixth year of graduation at the Federal University of Health Science of Porto Alegre. The demographic and characterization data of the sample were collected, and a questionnaire was applied and validated with 19 direct questions about pain and palliative care. RESULTS: Forty-seven students agreed to participate in the study. The vast majority mentioned not receiving enough information during the undergraduate program about the proper handling of patients with pain, and patient care in a terminal situation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights education gaps on pain and palliative care in medical schools. It shows the difficulties of the students have to put the theoretical knowledge into practice, for example, their insecurity in handling pain, especially when it comes to the use of opioids.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to translate, validate and evaluate a British specialty choice inventory. This tool processes the answers to 130 items and returns a 59-medical specialty ranking, in decreasing order of recommendation, based on the candidate's profile adjustments to specialty characteristics. The top 10 and the bottom 10 recommendations are considered positive and negative ones, respectively. Translation and semantic adaptation followed the standard procedures described in the specialized literature, and resulted in a Brazilian Portuguese version named SCIB (Specialty Choice Inventory – Brasil). The best version of each translated item was chosen. SCIB was then applied to 120 Brazilian physicians (85 specialists and 35 residents) representing 38 different specialties. SCIB was also applied to 79 senior medical students. Participant physicians indicated in a structured questionnaire two specialties they could have chosen apart from the current one, as well as three specialties they would unlikely choose. SCIB was regarded as adequate or very adequate to the Brazilian conditions by 85.8\% (103/120) of the physicians and 73.4\% (58/79) of the students. Among the latter, 60.8\% (48/79) regarded the inventory useful or very useful. For the physicians, SCIB positive recommendations included their current specialty in 67.5\% (81/120) of the cases, and any of the specialties they could have chosen in 72.5\% (87/120) of the cases. SCIB negative recommendations included any of the specialties that participants would unlikely choose in 87.5\% (105/120) of the cases. The translation and adaptation procedures provided data for SCIB validation concerning the face, content and semantic aspects. Answers from the 120 physicians and data from a test-retest study involving 40 participants showed that SCIB has satisfactory levels of homogeneity, internal consistency and reproducibility. In conclusion, translation and adaptation for use in Brazil of the Sci59, a British inventory for assisting medical specialty choice, was successful and resulted in the, SCIB, a tool whose performance was very satisfactory. SCIB can thus be seen as a promising tool for assisting medical specialty choice, as well as for research in this field.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Brazilian primary health care and mental health policies have contributed significantly to improving health care in the country. Both defend the basic principles of the Unified Health System (SUS) and propose a change in the health care model, focusing on a decentralized, community/family-oriented approach, rather than the traditional centralized, hospital-oriented model. Objective: This article aims to provide practical elements, which may serve as a model for the implementation of mental health education programs for primary health care physicians who work in Brazil. Methods: Learning needs in mental health were identified using data triangulation methodology that drew on literature review, questionnaires and focus groups. The study was conducted in the town of Sobral,, Ceará, with the participation of 26 family physicians from 28 Basic Health Units and three psychiatry professors from Brazilian medical schools. Results: Most of the family doctors felt unprepared to solve mental health problems and identified major gaps in their medical training. They reported that the focus on mental health issues was insufficient, and centered on the hospital setting and healing, rather than in the context of community care. The educational program developed provides health teams and health education institutions with the conceptual, practical and methodological framework for primary-level mental health education initiatives. Conclusion: The tools to identify health learning needs proved useful in the development of continuing education programs together with primary health professionals. For the purposes of validation, it is suggested that this program be tested in different Brazilian cities followed by thorough evaluation.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: The internet is now an essential tool, through which people enjoy easy and rapid access to information and can maintain personal relationships through social networks. However, when its use becomes uncontrolled and maladaptive, what can entail is known as Internet Addiction (IA). In previous studies, several comorbidities associated with this disorder have been investigated, generating knowledge that is important for clinical management. Objective: To investigate the correlation between indicators of internet use and social networks with the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative study with convenience sampling, carried out with medical students in 2015. The anxiety and depression symptoms were analyzed through the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively. In addition, a questionnaire made by the researchers based on the internet Addiction Test (IAT) was used. Results: Out of the 169 students who participated in the research, 98.8\% (167) use the internet and/or social networks on a daily basis. The prevalence of various indications of the harmful use of the internet was evaluated, as well as the participants' conception of its use. No statistical association was found between the time spent on the internet and the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to the BAI and BDI scores. However, some statistically significant associations were observed between the results obtained from the BAI and BDI and indicators of the need for internet verification as well as signs of maladaptive use of the internet. Conclusion: The present study ratifies the previous findings in the literature by pointing out that IA is not necessarily related to the time spent on the internet, but rather to a maladaptive pattern of use. The results found here may serve as basis for future interventions in educational institutions that seek to minimize the damage of this disorder, which has become increasingly present.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to characterize the profile and professional career of graduates from the São Paulo State residency programs in Family and Community Medicine. Methods: A descriptive, crosssectional study with a quantitative approach, which characterized the profile of the 234 graduating medical residents from 17 São Paulo State residency programs in Family and Community Medicine (PRMFC) who completed residency between 2000 and 2009. Results: Of the 234 residents, 55.1\% responded to the survey questionnaire, the majority (96.9\%) were Brazilian, born in the state of São Paulo (71.2\%), 58.1\% were women; 88.4\% were 39 years of age or younger, 89.1\% lived in large urban centers and they tended to settle in the state of São Paulo (80.0\%), where the residency was conducted. The doctors worked in the area of Family and Community Medicine (74.0\%); 49.6\% related to the Family Health Strategy. Staying in the area was favored more by those who, upon graduating, wanted to be family doctors (77.6\%) than thos who did not (63.6\%). Almost half of the graduates reported having two or three jobs and 99.2\% continued their education after the residence. Interest in teaching was observed among 48.1\% of the respondents who reported teaching in undergraduate and graduate courses, including medical residency programs, while a third of the respondents reported conducting research activities. Conclusion: A better understanding of the profile and whereabouts of trained primary health care professionals can contribute towards constructing an identity for family doctors, thereby strengthening this medical specialty. The study results indicate a favorable outlook for the Community and Family Medicine speciality in São Paulo, however this cannot be generalized for such an unequal health system in Brazil, even considering the improvements brought about by recent SUS management regulation measures. The literature reviewed and discussed shed light on the potential in the field of specialist training, but for undergraduate training, the effectiveness of these changes takes longer to become apparent.",

Objective: To identify the perception of graduates on the acquisition of abilities and competencies considered in the pedagogical project of a medical course. Methods: A cross-sectional study was developed with 229 graduates from a medical program carried out between 2005 and 2012, at UniversidadeAnhanguera-Uniderp in Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The study involved the application of a self-administered questionnaire including 34 competencies and abilities, assessed through a Likert scale, from April to July 2013. Results: Regarding the acquisition of general competences, ``good'' or ``very good'' answers were found for most of the studied items. For the competency regarding communication, most of the ``very good'' answers were found in the domains ``being capable of interacting with other health professionals'' (60\%) and ``being capable of maintaining information confidentiality'' (68\%). As for specific competencies, the majority of the graduates referred to the acquisition of most domains as ``good'' or ``very good''. The domains ``using scientifically validated therapeutic and diagnostic procedures'' and ``mastering knowledge in physiopathology, treatment and rehabilitation of prevalent diseases'' had the highest indices of ``good'' answers, 62\% and 59\%, respectively. As regards the acquisition of complementary competencies, the domains concerning general and specific practices, such as ``establishing a physician-patient relationship'', ``performing a physical exam correlating it to anatomical references'' and ``performing a general and segmentary physical exam'' achieveda greater percentage of positive answers (good or very good). The domains regarding ``performing a special neurological exam'', ``performing a special orthopedic exam'' and ``immobilizing fractures'' presented negative and regular answers, which when combined corresponded to 49\%, 69\% and 83\%, respectively. Conclusions: The present study served as a basis for changes in the course, providing resources for improving the quality of education and meeting the graduates' needs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This article points out the deficiency of medical courses in relation to Humanities and argues that the study of Bioethics — a discipline that seeks to integrate the Human and Biological Sciences — can help fill this harmful gap. We present the Convergent Bioethics of Ricardo Maliandi and Oscar Thüer as a valuable theoretical framework able to help physicians to solve or minimize ethical conflicts inherent to their professional practice, without undue unilateralism. Comparing its theoretical foundation with the well-known proposal of Beauchamp and Childress we point out the advantages of the former. We showcase its applicability with the analysis of potential ethical conflicts inferred from information obtained from medical records of a patient admitted tothe Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro. To that end, medical literature was studied in search of probabilistic data about the disease in question (esophageal cancer with fistula, complicated by pulmonary septic shock), noting that these data can help toward gaining a better understanding of the prognosis, but cannot be used by the medical team as support for unilateral decisions about therapeutic limitations. Reading Azoulay's work regarding patients with diseases with poor prognosis who eventually find themselves in intensive care, we highlight his proposal for difficult cases from an ethical point of view, recognizing and demonstrating its compatibility with the Convergent Bioethics of Maliandi and Thüer. This is a theoretical essay on therapeutic limitation, in which we seek to link the literature's foundation to real-case applicability of a critical patient. We believe that this article could be a starting point for the dissemination of Convergent Ethics — developed by the philosopher Ricardo Maliandi and explained with the aid of the physician Oscar Thüer as refers to bioethics — in medical courses, bringing more security and less loneliness in the difficult decision-making process inherent to the relationship between physicians and patient/family, particularly with regard to end of lifemedical care.",

 author = "Waizbort, Ricardo Francisco and Luz, Maurício Roberto Motta Pinto da",
 abstract = "ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to introduce some principles of Evolutionary Medicine to the community of medical educators in Brazil. Evolutionary Medicine can be defined as the application of the theory of evolution through natural selection to the understanding of human health problems. This innovative approach provides the medical field with a theoretical framework which contributes to the explanation of a great variety of serious disorders. Evolutionary Medicine, which dates back to the early 1960s, aims to explain diseases based both on recent physiological causes — those most commonly addressed by medicine — and on more distant evolutionary causes — those responsible for the emergence and survival of useful and functional biological structures throughout the history of the planet. Evolutionary Medicine rests on the assumption that functional biological characteristics are the result of evolutionary adaptive processes. Therefore, it is possible to analyze a great number of diseases in terms of adaptive vulnerabilities connected to our phylogenetic inheritance, such as human bodily inadequacies in relation to the modern environment. Besides presenting a definition of Evolutionary Medicine, this paper discusses two health problems recently dealt with in the light of the theory of evolution through natural selection. First, we discuss how the appearance, the ethnic and geographic distribution of lactose intolerance (and, on the other hand, the persistence of lactase) can only be understood taking our species' recent evolutionary history (including its cultural transformations) into consideration. The limitations faced by previous explanations, which lacked evolutionary causes — are discussed. Secondly, the paper discusses herniated spinal disc, trying to demonstrate the link between this condition and the adaptation problems that bipedal posture may entail in view of the demands of modern lifestyle. The understanding of such problems of adaptation, combined with restrictions to natural selection pressures when adjusting a quadruped structure to a biped lifestyle, serve as the basis for the development of specific concepts used to formulate a hypothesis with relevant diagnostic potential. Finally, the paper describes ways in which medical students could incorporate this relatively new knowledge into their education.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT A new type of doctor-patient relationship is emerging due to the widespread use of social media. Therefore, a review of certain aspects of medical education is needed in order to preserve the trust and cooperation of the doctor-patient relationship. Objectives: To describe the online behaviour of medical students, their opinions the use of social media and to understand aspects of undergraduate medical training regarding ethics and professionalism. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 260 medical students enrolled in the fifth and sixth years at three medical schools in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The data were collected between August 2015 and July 2016 at the teaching hospitals of each medical school. This paper reports the results from a structured questionnaire composed by the authors about online ethics and professionalism and answered by the students. The obtained data were analysed by means of the following statistical tests: Pearson's Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis and McNemar tests. For the Likert scale-type part of the questionnaire average ranking was calculated for student responses. Cronbach Alpha was also calculated. The study was approved by the Ethics on Research Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. In order to ensure the confidentiality of the results, the medical schools had their names omitted. Results: A total of 84 students (32.3\%) reported that they had posted pictures or videos with patients and 108 (41.5\%) had posted pictures or videos with alcoholic drinks or cigarettes. A statistically significant difference (p<0.001) was found between the three medical schools relative to students posting pictures or videos with patients. The students from institution number III were the least likely to post photos or videos with patients or with alcoholic drinks or cigarettes, according to their answers to the questionnaire. Furthermore, institution number III also had the highest number of students that reported having addressed issues of online professionalism in medical training(262\%/22). Analysing the three institutions separately an inverse relationship was found between ``posting photos or videos with patients'' and ``online professionalism during undergraduate training''. Among those surveyed, 79\% (205) agreed that some content published by doctors on Facebook might harm the doctor's reputation. Students reported having had no discussions concerning online professionalism during their undergraduate course in 80.8\% of the cases. Analysing the curriculum from the three medical schools, only institution number III was found to offer specific content regarding professional development and formally addressed theories regarding concepts of ethics during the medical residency. Conclusion: When we consider the recommendations found in the Code of Medical Ethics, resolutions published by the Brazilian Federal Medical Council (BFMC), and foreign guidelines, it was evident that a large number of students had posted inappropriate content online. A failure to adequately address ethics and professionalism as part of academic training may well play a part in issues related to the behaviour of medical students on social meda. More research into online behaviour and ethics/professionalism taught as part of undergraduate training is needed to infer causal relationships. Finally, it could be concluded that online professionalism was a topic that was scarcely addressed in the curricula of the surveyed medical schools.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The time required to complete undergraduate medical courses is well established in medical school training programs worldwide. However, not all students complete the degree in the expected timeframe, which can lead to a low graduation rate. Nevertheless, an isolated analysis of the graduation rate does not accurately predict the magnitude of training costs if it does not take into account the average completion time, particularly for undergraduate medical course for which the training time is longer and requires substantial resources. The aim of this study was to determine the length of time to complete the degree, as well as the proportion of students who graduated within the regular timeframe. In this retrospective study, we analysed data from 15 cohorts of medical students who finished the undergraduate program at the Faculty of Medicine of the Agostinho Neto University (FMUAN) in Angola, from 2001 to 2015. Data were collected from the academic records registered at the FMUAN. From the total number of graduates (n = 1259), 59.7\% were women and the average age at course completion was 35 ± 7 years. The average admission rate was 6.8\%, and it was found that 88 students (36 men and 52 women) had graduated per year. On average, students took 10 years to complete the degree. The graduation rate was 82.2\%, and only 24.2\% of the total graduates concluded the program in the regular period of six years. The results suggest that despite a high graduation rate, less than one third of the students finished the training program within the expected timeframe, highlighting the need to identify the causes of prolonged course duration which may have implications for both academic management and for human resource planning in health. Thus, a combined analysis of graduation rate and the time to complete the undergraduate course may be a good indicator of the efficiency of the medical education system.",

The distribution of normality was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and repeated measures ANOVA (split plot) was used to test the interaction between time and group. Results: No significant interaction between group and time was observed for any analyzes variables, indicating that the irradiated group did not show advantages over the placebo group. Conclusion: After the proposed fatigue protocol, a single low-power laser application was not sufficient to produce positive effects on strength performance and on the electromyographic signal of the biceps brachii muscle of volleyball athletes.",

Deficits in this system can lead to body instability and overload of musculoskeletal structures generating dysfunction and pain. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate postural control in three different sports modalities: taekwondo, handball, and American football. Methods: All athletes performed a one-legged stance/balance test on a force platform in the right and left lower limbs. Three tests of thirty seconds each were performed with eyes open. The mean of the three tests was used to measure the parameters of postural control, pressure center and velocity of anteroposterior and mediolateral displacements. Results: Significant differences were observed among the three groups in all analyzed parameters (P=<0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed that taekwondo athletes had better postural control (P=<0.035) of lower limbs compared to the other two modalities. There were no significant differences between handball and American football. Conclusion: Taekwondo athletes have better postural control during the one-legged stance/balance test than handball and American football athletes.",

In this sense, the studied variables were analyzed as possible predictors of performance. Objective: To develop different regression models in order to predict performance using the anthropometric variables body composition, maximal oxygen consumption, and strength. Methods: Twenty rowers participated in the study (21.35±0.98 years). The tests of maximal oxygen consumption, strength, 500 m, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were applied. Multiple linear regressions were performed on SPSS 16 for the four different regression models. The reliability of the models was indicated by the coefficient of determination R2 and by the standard error of the estimation (SEE). Results: The anthropometry-power models (R2=0.92, SEE=0.06), VO2 peak (R2=0.88, SEE=0.07), strength-power (R2=0.93, SEE=0.06) presented reliable prediction for 500 m in the rowing ergometer, as well as the combination of all the variables (R2=0.94, SEE=0.08). Conclusion: Once these analyzes have been made, we can assure the necessity of these models with the objective of complementing the identification, selection of talents and, above all, improvement in performance.",

Taking as reference the public policies cycle, the study focuses on the formulation and implementation stages. Using the analytical reference the concepts of bureaucratic insulation and window of opportunity, it is argued that the PMM has instigating aspects, either because of the insulated characteristics that mark its formulation process - which leads one to believe that the program has been maintained disregarding the external pressures of this initial phase -, or because of the favorable environment created by the days of June 2013, marked by popular manifestations that paved the way for the federal government to launch the clearly controversial initiative.

Objective: To study the perception of the teaching staff of the medical school at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (FMUFMG) concerning the psychological distress of the students. Method: A cross-sectional quantitative study carried out with the faculty of the UFMG medical school. The sample of 102 teachers was obtained by random draw and divided into four groups: males with up to ten (10) years of teaching, males with more than ten (10) years, females with up to ten (10) years of teaching, and females with more than ten (10)years. A self-applied 28-item questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree was prepared. For the data analysis four indicators were elaborated: psychological distress perception indicator (IPSP), commitment of the teacher to the student emotional difficulties indicator (ICDE), performance in the face of psychological distress indicator (IAPS) and a general indicator (IG). Quartile analysis was carried out and the difference among the groups was calculated using nonparametric tests. Five questions that were not included in the indicators were independently analyzed. Results: Seven teachers refused to participate and 79 answers were collected.The results showed varying degrees of concern among the groups in relation to the psychological distress of students. For the IG, the female teachers with longer teaching experience obtained a higher median in relation to the men with less teaching experience (p<0.05). For the other indicators, despite the difference between the quartiles, the comparison of the medians showed no statistically significant differences. For questions not included in the indicators, it was shown that 85\% of the sample had perceived psychological distress among their students. Male teachers more frequently deny psychological distress among students. 16.5\% of the teachers did not know of any instances of institutional psychological care. The occurrence of bullying failed to be noted by more than 50\% of the teachers. Only 28\% of the teachers admitted that their actions or attitudes could precipitate a student's psychological distress. When questioned about emotional support for teachers, 75.9\% would appreciate some institutional support. Conclusion: The present study, despite its limitations, is unique in assessing the perception of the medical teaching staff in relation to the psychological distress of the students. Teaching experience and being female seem to play an important role in the teacher's perception of psychological distress among students. A significant portion of the teaching staff ignores the existence of psychological support programs for students.",

There are several ways to identify individuals, depending on whether he is alive or dead (cadaver or skeleton). This research aimed to create a database for facial soft tissue thickness in living individuals of a specific Brazilian population, according to age, sex and body mass index. Methods: Measurements of facial soft tissues thickness were done in 101 patients (62 men and 39 women, aged 18 to 106 years). CT scans were performed taking into account 20 craniometric points previously selected. The soft tissue thickness in these points were initially found and compared with age, sex and nutritional status, and with another populations data worldwide. Results: According about sex was no significant difierence in points: nasion, rhinion, midphiltrum, supradentale and lateral orbit. Distances with significant difference for both sexes between the diferent populations were: supradentale; infradentale; supramentale; lateral orbit; zygomatic arch and occlusal line. Some anthropometric points showed significant differences between sex, age groups and nutritional status. Between sexes, men had greater means. Among age groups, there was also significant differences in some distances. In relation to nutritional status, the distances were lower among normal weight and higher among the obese. Conclusion: When considering various populations, soft tissue thickness had significant differences in many craniometric points highlighting how distinct they might be.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Liposuction is the second commonest procedure performed in Brazil. The scope for liposuction has broadened with advances in the technique, with better equipment, and increased safety in the surgical environment. However, there are concerns about patient safety. Safety committees have made recommendations on various aspects of the procedure including infiltration, anesthesia, patient selection, and aspirated volume. The Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery and the Federal Council of Medicine have also determined the parameters for aspiration safety volumes, and for the aspiration of body surface. However, supporting literature for the recommendations is scarce. The objective is to evaluate changes in hemoglobin, serum iron, and total protein levels in the peri-operative days (between 7 and 10 days), in addition to its impact in patients. Methods: We performed a prospective study, with patients submitted to either liposuction alone, or in conjunction with abdominal dermolipectomy for esthetic indications. We evaluated 30 patients, collecting their demographic data, weight, body mass index, hemoglobin, serum iron, and total protein levels in both, the pre-operative period, and between 7 and 10 post-operative days. Results: The fall in hemoglobin levels were between 2 and 6 g /dL, with an average of 3.1 g /dL between 7 and 10 post-operative days . A minimum hemoglobin value of 7.8 g/dL was noted between 7 and 10 days after surgery, while the mean reduction of serum iron was found to be 44.87 g/dL. Conclusion: The reduction in hemoglobin levels was responsible for the clinical symptoms. Iron supplementation was required in the immediate postoperative period.",

Methods A retrospective descriptive study, with analysis of clinical processes of adolescents (10-18 years) seen at the Adolescent Medicine Clinic, from January 2006 to December 2013. The following variables were analyzed: sex, age, number of visits, referring service and primary diagnoses according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. As to the variable age, the adolescents were divided into two groups: Group I comprised those aged 10-14 years, and Group II, 15-18 years. Results A total of 7,692 visits were carried out, in that, 1,659 first visits (22\%), with an annual growth rate of 6\%. The mean age was 14.2 years, and 55\% of patients were female. The group of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases was the most representative in our sample (34\%), with obesity being the most frequent diagnosis in both sexes and age groups (23\%), with a higher prevalence in males (13\% male versus 10\% female, p<0.001) and younger adolescents (18\% in Group I versus 5\% in Group II p<0.001). The group of mental and behavioral disorders was the second most prevalent (32\%), affecting mainly females (39\% female versus 22\% male, p<0.001) and the older age group (39\% Group II versus 27\% Group I, p<0.001). Social problems were the primary diagnosis in 8\% of visits. Conclusion Most diseases diagnosed have a strong behavioral and social component, particularly mental disorders and obesity. This specific type of diagnoses reinforces the need for a global approach for adolescents and specialized adolescent medicine units/clinics.",

The implementation of evidence-based guidelines is a global challenge, and traditional strategies based only on disseminating their recommendations have proven insufficient for changing prevailing clinical practice. A major challenge for adherence to the new guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil is the current pattern in the use of mammographic screening in the country, which very often includes young women and a short interval between tests. Such practice, harmful to the population's health, is reinforced by the logic of defensive medicine and the dissemination of erroneous information that overestimates the benefits of screening and underestimates or even omits its harms. In addition, there is a lack of policies and measures focused on early diagnosis of symptomatic cases. To overcome these barriers, changes in the regulation of care, financing, and implementation of shared decision-making in primary care are essential. Audit and feedback, academic detailing, and the incorporation of decision aids are some of the strategies that can facilitate implementation of the new recommendations.",

RESULTS: The analysis, guided by the model of Signs, Meanings, and Actions, shows a vast mosaic of situations and issues that permeate the medical care in an emergency unit. The results indicate that physicians may consider one death more difficult than another, depending on the criteria: age, identification or not with the patient, circumstances of the death, and medical questioning as to their responsibility in the death process. CONCLUSIONS: For physicians, no death is easy. Each death can be more or less difficult, depending on different criteria that permeate the medical care in an emergency unit, and it reveals different social, ethical, and moral issues.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To verify the adequacy and factors associated with compliance with the immunization schedule (BCG, DTP-Hib, MMR, PCV-10) in children hospitalized with pneumonia at a pediatric referral hospital in Northeast Brazil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study with an analytical component, with a sample of 452 children hospitalized with pneumonia at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira, between 2010 and 2013. The inclusion criterion was children aged from one month to less than five years of age with proof in the immunization record. The exclusion criterion was the presence of hospital-acquired pneumonia or concomitant disease. We have evaluated the adequacy of the immunization schedule for the BCG, tetravalent, MMR, and 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV-10) vaccines. We used the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test followed by multivariate Poisson regression, estimating the crude and adjusted prevalence ratios and respective 95\% confidence intervals. The variables with p < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was good adequacy in the immunization schedule, except for PCV-10, which presented a percentage lower than 85\%. We have observed an association between adequate compliance with the immunization schedule and education level of the mother (89.9\% complete high school), sex of the child (87.2\% female), age of the child (94.2\% younger than six months), and breastfeeding (84.3\% breastfed). CONCLUSIONS: Given the high rate of education level of the mother and the high percentage of breastfeeding, we can understand that there is a better understanding of the health of the child by the mothers studied in this study, showing the effectiveness of public policies for infant feeding. However, children did not have good adequacy of the immunization schedule of PCV-10, one of the main vaccines against pneumonia, which can be one of the main factors in the causes of hospitalization, with no influence on the classification of the severity of the disease. In this way, we emphasize that the causes of pneumonia morbidity are not associated with a single factor.",

Five years earlier, an overseas expedition from this school had been in the region to investigate yellow fever. When Thomas and his colleague Anton Breinl set sail for Manaus, their mission was still to investigate this disease. In the interval between the two expeditions, dynamic processes were underway in the realm of tropical medicine, especially with regard to trypanosomiasis. Thomas gained recognition when he showed that atoxyl was an effective treatment for humans and animals infected with trypanosomes. In this article, Thomas guides us through a web of actors and diseases in the Americas, Europe and Africa. Their synergies reveal the outlines of tropical medicine and the place occupied by the Amazon region within this field at the beginning of the twentieth century, with special emphasis on trypanosomiasis. Until his death in Manaus in 1931, Thomas involved himself with other local health problems and with physicians who were on the forefront of Amazonian public health and experimental medicine, an unusual course for most European researchers sent on missions to colonies and areas influenced by imperial metropolises. Thomas was `rediscovered' two decades after his death when he was named one of the recipients of a prize from the Belgian government granted to the scientists who discovered the treatment for sleeping sickness. As we shall see, his memory was revived on other occasions in the academic sphere.",

 abstract = "Abstract The concepts of electricity and magnetism, way before appearing as fundamental aspects of contemporary science and techonology, had their virtues sung in prose and verse, analyzed in philosophical studies, extolled in moral treatises, applied in medicine and, even in mythological literature. The history of its discovery, which we believe has not yet been completed, is confused with the very history of human knowledge, since remote times. Considering its importance, we will therefore try to weave some facts and narratives regarding to the formation of the concepts of electricity and magnetism throughout ancient history until the Middle Ages, in order to contribute with the studies related to this temporal cut in the context of physics.",

We retrospectively evaluated the following parameters: age, diagnoses during hospitalization and comorbidities, serum levels of albumin and hemoglobin, place of hospitalization, drug involved, anatomic segment affected, therapeutic management and death during hospitalization. Results: we followed-up 14 patients. The main drug involved was noradrenaline (21\%). All patients underwent debridement of tissue necrosis. Three patients were submitted to flaps after preparation of the wound bed with negative pressure therapy, with good results. Seven patients had no definitive treatment of their lesions due to lack of clinical conditions. Conclusion: in patients with favorable clinical conditions, the definitive treatment with flaps was adequate for cases of wounds due to extravasation of drugs in the subcutaneous tissue when there was exposure of noble structures.",

This was a single and integrated case study with multiple analytical units and a qualitative approach. A total of 17 focus groups were performed, in which 47 health professionals were heard (14 physicians, 19 nurses, and 14 dentists), members of 17 family health teams in 16 municipalities in the South of Brazil. The empirical material was analyzed from the perspective of Foucauldian discourse analysis. The family health teams, adopting general practice, reported difficulties in conducting prenatal care, evoking and bolstering the discourse of obstetric medicalization that their practice should supposedly offset. The discourse officially adopted by humanization, prioritized in the generalist model of prenatal care, continues to function as a complementary discourse to that of medicalization and specialization, which prevails in the practices reported by the teams. The emphasis on humanized care for pregnant women tests the limits of professional territories and assumes the renegotiation of competencies. Efforts at collaboration between the family health teams and obstetricians have not proved very successful in this specific case.",

The vast majority of nurses (90\%) reported complying with the existing recommendations on hand hygiene in pre-established moments. However, none of the nurses were able to identify all the moments for hand hygiene using water and soap or alcohol-based handrub.

RESULTS The participants presented high demand and high control of the work and low social support, indicating an active work. Nurses had less control over work (p<0.001) and physicians received more social support (p=0.006). Reduced social support was related to greater exposure to stress among nursing assistants and technicians (p=0.012). CONCLUSION Workers who felt the low social support had higher exposure to stress.

Next, it analyzes the social base of certified physicians and nurses, using data from the 2000 and 2010 Population Censuses. The results show that there was an expansion in the social base of recruitment in both professions, especially an increase in students from low-income families and those self-identified as black or brown. The social base of certified physicians and nurses underwent a reconfiguration, characterized by rejuvenation and a decrease in work market remuneration. The two processes were experienced differently within and between the professions, highlighting the existence of differences in the respective professional groups' capacity to mobilize resources proper to the professional world and that can guarantee special positions in the work market and in social structure.",

The clinical outcome data showed that 69.7\% of patients improved after treatment with acupuncture, 16.7\% had no significant response and 13.6\% died. No patient had worsening, despite three of nine animals that died were due to progression of the primary disease treated only with acupuncture. The main indications for the use of acupuncture in cats at the clinic were neurological diseases - particularly trauma in the spinal cord and brain - where there was an improvement in 53.7\% of the animals. Treatment was considered successful in neurological cases, when animals regained independent locomotion and in cases of spinal disease, when neurological scores changed for IV or V to I or II. Dry needle acupuncture was the most used technique for the treatment, with 94.7\% of prevalence, followed by electroacupuncture (30.6\%) and laserpuncture (21.4\%). The mean number of acupuncture sessions were 6.97±14.97. It was concluded that acupuncture was efficient to treat most of the cats with different clinical conditions, showing that these species probably respond as well as dogs after acupuncture treatment.",

Results: 22 medical specialties were identified as related to BS. The five specialties with the highest prevalence of BS cases were, in decreasing order: intensive care unit medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, internal medicine and orthopedics. Discussion: the syndrome etiology is multifactorial. There are factors associated with BS that contribute to the onset of the syndrome and others that may prevent its outcome. Factors that are common to medical practice and others associated with medical specialties were identified. The main factors associated with BS are those related to work organization and environment and the way physicians cope with stress.",

We investigated this training based on bibliographic review and discourse analysis of documents that describe the emergence of FCM and interviews with individuals directly linked to it. We were able to identify that the discursive formation of the FCM is traversed by the histories of general medical practice, family and community; the structuring of Primary Health Care; of Community Medicine programs; and the formation of Collective Health in Brazil. In addition, it is linked to the scientific field of general medicine and international family and its affirmation as a medical specialty. As a scientific society, it has been presenting doubts regarding the historical guidelines of the health movement and the defense of a public, universal and anti-privatization health system. However, in order to avoid institutional crystallization, we believe it is necessary to think of FCM as a heterogeneous field and without a single history.",

Because stem cells and Nanotechnology are two areas of extremely promising science, a new field of study, called ``stem cell Nanotechnology'', has gradually emerged. In this, Nanotechnology is used to help the stem cells apply their therapeutic potential in the treatment, cure, and repair of the damaged tissues, in an effective and safe way. In this way, stem cell Nanotechnology has generated great interest, since it may result in significant contributions to Regenerative Medicine and tissue engineering. The present work aims to present the state-of-the-art regarding its therapeutic use in Human Medicine.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Some of the first Renaissance manuscripts of the cookbook attributed to Apicius, produced in the second half of the 15th century, were almost certainly made to integrate private libraries of powerful signori of Northern and Central Italy. Nonetheless, the long history of the Apician manuscript Plut. 73.20 - an item that was moved from the Medici's private collection to the first modern public library in Florence, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana - allows further considerations about it. The investigation of its material aspects, as well as of its physical and spatial location in the library, will be used in this article as a starting point to discuss how the contents of Apicius' cookbook were interpreted and classified by the humanists of its time. The working hypothesis is that humanists, particularly those interested in medicine, were fundamental in changing its classification, at least temporarily, from culinary to medical one.",

 abstract = "Abstract: The objective of this study was to understand how physicians at the largest emergency department in a large Brazilian city orient care for critical patients with suspected brain death and who are potential organ donors. This ethnographic study was conducted in an emergency care hospital, a reference in traumatology in Latin America, located in downtown Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State. The institution took pioneering steps in Brazil with a specific sector where patients with suspected brain death are referred. The fieldwork was performed over the course of nine months, based on targeted observations and interviews with 43 on-duty staff physicians (25 men and 18 women), from 28 and 69 years of age. Data analysis followed the ``signs, meanings, and actions'' model. The ethnography revealed the process of medical care for patients with suspected brain death, including: intensive care, adherence to protocol, and communicating the patient's status to the family. In the latter case, the dialogue reveals the controversies in the concept of brain death, the sociocultural context, and the emergency care context. It became clear that this process of medical care extrapolates merely normative issues, entering into a complex web of elements, especially the professional's role as mediator of a myriad of interwoven elements and tensions. Between confirmation of the brain death and communicating the situation to the family, ambivalent perceptions emerge, both for the physicians and the family members. The study evidenced how the tenuous definition of what constitutes life and death touches on all of the medical act, with direct implications on care for patients/potential donors and their families.",

Methods: Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire during the Biostatistics course in August of 2016. The students were inquired about demographic characteristics, data on their secondary education and college entrance exams, practice of physical exercise, leisure activities done, to have a physician in the family, and specialty that they intended to pursue as a career. Results: Most of the students were women aged 18 to 21 years and who were originally from the state of São Paulo, had received secondary education in a private school, took a course to prepare for college entrance exam, and participated in more than 5 college entrance exams in the same year they entered in the School of Medicine. The majority of participants practiced physical exercise regularly and were engaged in common leisure activities. Most of students (58\%) had a physician in the family and more than half (52\%) did not know which specialty to pursue as career. There was no association between relationship with a physician and the student's choice of a specialty (p=0.390). Conclusion: Although it was the first group of student of School of Medicine at Faculdade Israelita de Ciências da Saúde Albert Einstein who took a different admission process, our data showed that students' profile is similar to students from other colleges.",

Methods: we evaluated the residents approved in the public contest for the Medical Residency Program in General Surgery of HC-FMUSP in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. We carried out the study by applying a questionnaire and gathering information from the Medical Residency Commission of the Institution. We analyzed data on identification, origin of the candidate, undergraduate school, surgical teaching received, reason for choosing Surgery, residency expectations, choice of future specialty and pretensions as to the end of medical residency. We also analyzed the result of the examination of access to specialties. Results: the mean age was 25.8 years; 74.3\% of residents were male. The majority (84.4\%) had attended public medical schools, 68\% of which were not in the Southeast region; 85,2\% of the residents were approved in the first contest. The specialty choice was present for 75.9\% of individuals at the beginning of the residency program, but 49.5\% changed their minds during training. Plastic Surgery, Urology and Digestive System Surgery were chosen by 61.5\%. Sixty hours per week work were considered adequate by 83.3\%; 27.3\% favored direct access to the specialty. At the end of the specialty, 53.3\% intended to continue in São Paulo, and 26.2\%, to return to their State of origin. A strict-sense post-graduate course was intended by 68.3\%. Conclusion: the current profile of the resident reveals a reduction in the demand for General Surgery, an earlier definition of the specialty, options for increasingly specific areas and an activity that offers a better quality of life.",

Sessions were recorded and the content was analyzed in two stages using the Wordle.net platform and Bardin technique. Focal groups discussed five main topics: faculty teaching skills; academic planning; faculty skills evaluation by students; theory-practice integration and the teaching-learning process. In general, it was observed that all the students had similar ideas, but those with more years in the course showed greater mastery of subjects.

It is assumed that the provision of effectively differentiated health care actions, which consider the socio-cultural specificities of indigenous peoples and their traditional medicine, can contribute to a greater resolution of health services targeted for these peoples and mitigation of some social determinants of their ways of living and dying. Thus, a qualitative study with an ethnographic approach was developed, using participant observation techniques and semi-structured interviews with managers of the Subsystem in Bahia. Data collection took place between September 2014 and March 2017. The narratives often revealed a rhetorical tone of the idea of ``differentiated health care'' as an initiative to respect indigenous cultural specificities, which were insistently used as a justification for not conducting differentiated practices (as specific protocols, for example). The presence of indigenous people in the management contributed for producing more contextualized practices, oriented to the problems experienced by the communities, but the effort to legitimize themselves in this social space ratifies a ``white'' hegemony in the main topic of discussions.",

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI after a training session of jiu-jitsu athletes on creatine kinase (CK), functional strength tests, and isokinetic parameters. Methods: Twelve jiu-jitsu athletes (age 21.75 ± 3.10 years; BMI 24.65 ± 3.81 kg/m2; training time 3.41 ± 0.51 years) were selected. Considering that this is a crossover study, each group had the participation of 12 athletes with a 30-day wash-out. Participants were divided into two experimental groups: (I) control group (CON), in which the athletes did not underwent CWI, and (II) CWI group, in which athletes underwent CWI (~ 12 °C) for six minutes. The physical exertion was carried out in a training session with simulation of jiu-jitsu fights, with four fights five minutes each and an interval of three minutes between them. Plasma CK, static and dynamic protocols of the Kimono Grip Strength Test, and isokinetic parameters (peak torque, work, and power) were assessed before and after the experimental recovery procedures. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance (time and treatment). The level of significance was 5\%. Results: The effect of time on the comparison of plasma CK (increase of 174.39 ± 99.95 IU/l for CON and increase of 187.91 ± 113.02 IU/l for CWI) and static test KGST (Δt of -5.83 ± 9.35 s for CON and Δt of -2.83 ± 13.94 s for CWI) was observed before and after the experimental recovery procedures, but without treatment effect (P> 0.05). Isokinetic parameters were not influenced (P>0.05). Conclusion: It is concluded that the CWI did not promote post-exertion recovery in jiu-jitsu athletes. Level of Evidence II; Lesser quality RCT.",

Objective: The present study investigated this relationship in adults from Muzambinho, Minas Gerais, a population with a high rate of physically active individuals. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-seven individuals (132 women), mostly young adults (44.3\% between 20 and 39 years) were assessed. Cardiovascular risk predictors (body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, fasting cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure), physical activity (total weekly volume of total physical activity) and physical fitness (aerobic fitness and relative hand strength) were measured. Results: More than 90\% of the individuals were classified as active (they practiced physical activity for more than 150 min/week). Linear regression identified a negative association of relative hand strength and aerobic fitness to body mass index and waist circumference, as well as a positive association of relative hand strength with diastolic blood pressure. The indicators of physical activity and physical fitness showed no association with global cardiovascular risk. Conclusion: In this population, the inverse relationship between physical activity, physical fitness and cardiovascular risk was limited to physical fitness and obesity indicators, suggesting that in populations with high rates of physically active individuals, the increase in physical fitness, but not in physical activity, can help reduce obesity.

Methods: Forty-two rats were used, six animals per group: G1 - control euthanized on the 15th postoperative day (PO); G2, G3 and G4 - submitted to sciatic nerve compression, euthanized at 3rd, 8th and 15th PO days, respectively; G5, G6 and G7 - submitted to sciatic nerve compression and treated with cryotherapy, euthanized at 3rd, 8th and 15th PO days, respectively. The assessments of sciatic functional index (SFI) and the functional disability test took place at the pre-injury, 2nd PO and on the day of euthanasia in each group with injury. After the intervention period, the animals were anesthetized properly and the sciatic nerve distal to the compression procedure was dissected and collected for morphological analysis. Statistical analysis was by the mixed ANOVA test with a significance level of 5\%. Results: There was a decrease of SFI after injury and the functional disability test showed an increase in paw elevation time. Regarding the morphological analysis, the G1 showed normal nerve fibers and in the groups with lesion, there was nerve degeneration, G6 had a slight recovery of the nerve fibers, besides mild regeneration in G4 and G7.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of two different static stretching routines with the same total volume on passive range of motion (ROM), muscle activation (EMGRMS and EMGFM) and the performance resistance force (10-RM). Methods: Fourteen male subjects underwent three different randomized procedures: a) control condition (CC); b) fractionated static stretching (SS-30 s), and c) continuous static stretching (SS-2 min.). To measure the ROM, the digital photogrammetry method was used, and the force performance and myoelectric activation were measured by the 10-RM test in the unilateral leg press exercise and by the electromyographic signal of the vastus lateralis (VL), respectively. Results: There was significant difference in the ROM in the comparison between SS-2 min. vs. CC (P=0.006) and SS-30 s vs. CC (P=0.01). Both stretching conditions promoted significant acute increases in ROM in the comparisons prior to and immediately after (P=0.0001, 144.2±10.2 vs. 152.2±10.5 for SS-30 s and 147.4±11.9 vs. 155.1±9.9 for SS-2 min.), but with no difference between procedures. There was no significant difference for any other variables tested. Conclusion: Continuous and fractionated static stretching routines with less volume can be used to acutely increase the ROM levels without causing damage to muscle strength or activation levels.

Several factors are associated with population health problems, which can be previously identified through simple techniques such as anthropometric measurements and risk scores, used to determine potential risks. Objective: To relate anthropometric variables with the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in rural workers. Methods: Cross-sectional study with 138 rural workers, who completed a lifestyle questionnaire, anthropometric, biochemical, and cardiovascular evaluation and FRS evaluation. The anthropometry was estimated using the indicators body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), conicity index (CI), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR); the biochemical profile identified total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glycemia; the cardiovascular function was evaluated by systolic blood pressure and resting diastolic blood pressure. From this information, the subjects were classified according to the FRS in G1 (low risk), G2 (intermediate risk) and G3 (high risk). The statistical analyses consisted of frequency and percentage, comparison of means by Kruskal-Wallis test, and correlation of Pearson or Spearman, considering p<0.05. Results: Regarding FRS, 81.4\% of the female subjects and 51.9\% male showed low cardiovascular risk, with more than half of workers with inadequate responses in WHR (58.7\%), WHtR (67.4 \%), TC (58.0\%) and LDL (52.9\%). In the relation between the total of absolute points of FRS and the anthropometric variables, WC and WHtR showed weak correlations (0.293 and 0.175, respectively) and WHR and CI showed moderate correlations (0.475 and 0.459, respectively). Conclusion: Some anthropometric indicators (WHR and CI) had stronger relationships with FRS, indicating that they are more effective in certain populations, besides implying the higher probability of cardiovascular events in rural workers.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Brazilian legislation provides regulations for the marketing of supplements for athletes. In this context one of the most widely used supplements for athletes are the carbohydrate-rich ones, which are excellent sources of energy for exercise. Objective: To evaluate the adequacy of the labeling of supplements based on carbohydrates marketed in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil according to the current legislation. Methods: The labels of products marketed in drugstores and nutritional supplement stores were evaluated in the region of the Plano Piloto de Brasília. The information evaluated on the labels were intended use of the product, specific composition, presence of mandatory phrase and absence of prohibited images and expressions according to the Resolution of the Collegiate Board of Directors number 18/2010 of the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA). Results: Sixty national and imported products were cataloged. It was observed that 75\% of the sample products had some item that failed to comply with the regulation. The presence of the mandatory statement in bold and highlighted was the item with the highest percentage of inadequacy (73.3\%). In addition, there have been cases where the mandatory statement is worded with opposite meaning. All supplements have complied with the legislation regarding the minimum carbohydrate content relative to the total energy value of the product and the minimum amount of carbohydrate per serving. Conclusions: Considering that 75\% carbohydrate-based supplements were inadequate for labeling and that the most frequent mismatch was the absence or incorrect wording of the mandatory statement on the labels of supplements, it is concluded that this type of irregularity serves the interests of industry and not necessarily the interests of the consumer. The presence of the mandatory statement in the product is an easily enforceable requirement, therefore, it is emphasized a more efficient inspection of the energy supplements marketed.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Circuit training is a model of resistance exercise that allows a varied combination of overload and therefore, requires more information to understand the anaerobic glycolytic demand during its execution. Objective: The objective was to compare two weight training protocols with (Tconv) and without (Tcirc) pause between performances, regarding the blood lactate ([la]) response. Methods: Eleven men (21.0±2.3 years old, 76.7±5.4 kg, 179.5±7.0 cm) underwent to one-maximum repetition test (1RM). Tconv and Tcirc were prescribed at 60\%1RM, 12 repetitions, three laps with 300 s rest for Tcirc and three series of exercise with 180 s rest for Tconv. The exercises that comprised both training protocols were bench press, unilateral leg extension, shoulder press, double leg curl, high pulley, leg press 45º, seated row and hack-squat. The ANOVA (Bonferroni post-hoc) test compared [la] at the 1st, 3rd e 5th minute after the Tcirc laps and after each Tconv series. The independent t-test compared the means of the lactate peak between Tcirc and Tconv. In all analyzes the level of significance was set at P≤0.05. Results: Differences were observed for the [la] between the 1st (10.6±1.0 mmol/l) and 2nd lap (13.5±1.8 mmol/l, P=0.01), and between 1st and 3rd lap (15.0±2.5 mmol/L, P<0.01) in the Tcirc. During Tconv, the highest mean peak values of [la] were observed in high pulley (11.2±2.2 mmol/l) and leg-press 45º (11.9±2.6 mmol/l) exercises. There was a difference (P<0.01) when comparing the [la] between after Tconv (12.8±2.2 mmol/l) and Tcirc (15.9±2.0 mmol/l). Conclusion: Tcirc demands greater glycolytic response, emphasizing its effectiveness to increasing anaerobic muscle capacity. Furthermore, the non-intermittent execution of Tcirc can explain its greater glycolytic demand, since Tconv and Tcirc were proportionally designed regarding the volume and load protocol.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Seafood products represent an important source of proteins and minerals as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, its consumption in Brazil is very low in comparison to other kinds of meat. This may due to lack of skill in its preparation, making immensurable the importance of the search for new ways to market it, such as ready-made or semi-ready to serve products. The trawl fishery method often accidentally captures a variety of species, composed basically of low commercial value and size. Such catches are called ``second-hand catch''. With this in mind, this paper has as its main objective de development of two products: fish meatball and kibe, using what is considered accidental catches in the trawl fishery industry done on Rio de Janeiro's offshore as the raw material. The taxonomic identification of the species resulted in the species, Red porgy (Pagrus pagrus), Argentine croaker (Umbrina sp.), Atlantic bigeye (Priacanthus arenatus), Black cusk-eel (Conger sp.), Cusk-eel (Genypterus brasiliensis) and Blackfin goosefish (Lophius gastrophysus). The dry material of the raw product was 31.20±1.30\%, in the raw meatball and kibbeh the values was 37.90±1.10 and 32.10±1.10, respectively, in the baked product the results was 33.40±1.20 and 34.20±1.00 (kibbeh and meatball). The ash content in the pulp was 1.5\%, for the raw kibbeh and meatball, the amounts of ash were 2.55±0.05 and 1.47±0.05, respectively. For baked goods results were 1.87±0.05 for the kibbeh and 1.92±0.05 for the meatball. The measured lipid levels in the pulp was 4.80±0.30\%. In respect, raw kibbeh and meatball, the percentage of lipids were 4.20±0.80 and 4.20±0.60, respectively. For baked goods was 4.50±0.60 for the kibbeh and 4.40±0.60 for the meatball. The protein level presented in the raw material was 15.60±1.04\%, to the raw kibbeh and meatball was 17.80±2.16 and 14.90±2.12 and for the baked goods 15.10±2.10 both. Soluble nitrogen compounds shows values of 285mg/100g in the raw material, in the kibbeh NNP 291mg/100g and the meatball NNP 294mg/100g. The results of the total count of psychotropic remained below 7.0 log CFU/g, for standard count of aerobic microorganism plates.

A total of 40 production factors regarding the management, sanity, plant and equipment, nutrition, genetics and environment were taken into consideration. Pens with less than 20 pigs resulted in a reduction in DFI (P<0.05) and an improved FCR (P<0.01). In pens that used linear dump feeders, the DFI was less (P<0.01) and the FCR was better (P=0.001). Pens with shallow pools had higher DFI (P<0.01) and worse FCR (P<0.01). Batches of females had lower DFI (P<0.001) and better FCR (P<0.001) compared to mixed-sex batches. The factors used for the final models explained the 25\% and 46\% of the total variance for the DFI and FCR, respectively.

The hoof biopsies were performed at M0, M4, and M72 and the samples were subjected to zymography analysis. There was an increase in leukocytes in M12 and M24, due to the increase in segmented neutrophils and band neutrophils, which decreased as of M36. According to zymography technique not observed changes were not not observed in MMP-2 and -9, possibly due to the low intensity of the small colon lesions.

Reference intervals for the hormones sampled were indicated and the effects of species and sex on these values were analyzed. Concentration values of total T4, free T4, free T3 and TSH varied respectively from 0,3 to 2,5µg/dL (average =0,94µg/dL), 0,11 - 0,46ɳg/dL (average = 0,28ɳg/dL), 3,59 - 1,46pg/mL (average =2,42pg/mL), and 0,01 - 0,12µUI/mL (average= 0,04µUI/mL). There was interaction between species and sex (P0.05) for concentrations of free T4, free T3 and TSH, but species effect was observed (P<0.05) for free T3 concentrations. In this case, concentrations of free T3 were lower in Ara ararauna than in Ara chloropterus. The results of this study suggest that it is possible to measure serum concentration of thyroid hormones in macaws by means of chemiluminescence method, as long as relevant variations between different species and sexes are taken into account.",

The objective of this study was to compare the TPA obtained by calculating standard manual on conventional radiographs, with the values obtained by calculations in digital images through a computer program. Bilateral digital radiographs of hind limb were analyzed in true profile for 20 healthy dogs older than two years. Three observers with similar levels of experience in calculating the TPA conducted measurements on each radiograph. First we calculated the angle of the tibial plateaus manually in x-ray film and then the calculations were made through the program offered by the computer program in the digital image. The results of this study showed significant differences between the methods, with average value of 20.48±3.71 digital calculating average and 23.90±2.4 in the manual calculation. P value was < 0.01 when comparing averages. No significant difference in manual calculation in right profile were found between interobserver assessments, suggesting greater variation in manual calculation compared to digital. The calculation performed by the software showed less variation in values. The slight variation obtained in our results is believed to be due to the facilities provided by the software. There was a difference between the values obtained by means of conventional and digital methods for calculating the angle of the tibial plateau, and the smaller digital values between the observers and the digital method in the calculation of the tibial plateau angle led to less variation when compared to the manual method.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of ram semen frozen with extender with the flavonoid myricetin against damage to sperm. Eight pools of semen obtained from four ram breeders, were frozen with different concentrations of myicetin (0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000nM). After thawing, the semen was evaluated for spermatic kinetics, plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and membrane stability. Samples treated with 10nM myricetin preserved a lower percentage of rapid cells (P≤0.05) when compared to the 1000nM myricetin group. Samples from the control group presented higher (P≤0.05) VAP than 10nM group of myricetin, while cryopreserved samples with myicetin (10, 100 and 1000nM) showed greater (P<0.05) BCF, when compared to control group. The group treated with 1000nM myricetin had a higher percentage (P<0.05) of cells with lipid peroxidation, when compared to the control group. In conclusion, supplementation of ram semen cryopreservation extender with 10 and 100nM myricetin affects sperm kinetics, without causing changes in the overall structure of the gamete, while 1000nM myricetin causes changes in the kinetics associated with peroxidative damage.",

Five healthy adult horses received the L84 solution, in a volume corresponding to 10\% of BW, by continuous intravenous infusion, in two instants: a) rapid infusion (16.66mL/kg/h) during 6 hours; b) slow infusion (8.33mL/kg/h) during 12 hours. Venous blood samples were taken at the beginning of the infusion (hour 0) and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after. Urine samples were taken at 0, 6, 12, and 24h. pH (blood and urine), pCO2, HCO3-, BE, TPP, L-lactate, Na+, K+, Cl-, AG, SID, Atot, PVV, urine specific gravity, and L-lactate, Na+, K+, and Cl- renal fractional clearance were determined. The L84 solution causes lower magnitude alkalizing effect when administered slowly, due to the gradual correction of the iatrogenic imbalance by the kidneys during the infusion period. The L84 solution infused at a low rate in horses could be recommended in cases where metabolic acidosis is suspected and it is not possible to quantify the imbalance degree.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This study reports the development and evaluation of the use of ``Cell ELISA'' as a tool for clinical interpretation for the control of strangles. The presence of anti-S. equi antibodies was evaluated in horses with strangles, in asymptomatic carriers and in vaccinated foals. Equine positive for strangle showed higher average of absorbance (P<0.05) when compared with the average for the other categories of horses studied. Asymptomatic S. equi equine carriers had higher average of absorbance (P<0.05) than equines with negative culture. After vaccination, foals presented an increase in antibody levels, followed by a decrease in antibody levels 90 days post the second vaccination. The ``Cell ELISA'' was efficient for the detection of antibodies in horses exposed to S. equi antigens, differentiating infections with S. zooepidemicus. Thus, the test might be a clinical tool for indirect diagnosis of the strangles, differentiating, between the asymptomatic horses, the potential carriers of infection. The results observed in vaccinated foals confirm the potential use of this test as an auxiliary instrument for strangles vaccination programs based in the serological monitoring of the herd after immunization. These results suggest that the ``Cell ELISA'' is a promising auxiliary tool in the control of equine adenitis.",

At 30 days, the variables of performance, body composition and somatic indexes were evaluated. The animals submitted to the CPA-25\% treatment presented a growth response equivalent to those that received the Control treatment, but superior to the fish submitted to the CPA-50\%. There were no significant differences between treatments for the somatic indices evaluated. Animals submitted to diets containing CPA had higher body fat content. Body fat deposition was higher for fish fed with CPA-25\% and lower body protein deposition for those fed with CPA-50\%. The results indicate that CPA can substitute up to 25\% fish meal protein, without compromising the growth of jundias, and this level of substitution provided an 8\% reduction in diet cost.",

Both defend the basic principles of the Unified Health System (SUS) and propose a change in the health care model, focusing on a decentralized, community/family-oriented approach, rather than the traditional centralized, hospital-oriented model. Objective: This article aims to provide practical elements, which may serve as a model for the implementation of mental health education programs for primary health care physicians who work in Brazil. Methods: Learning needs in mental health were identified using data triangulation methodology that drew on literature review, questionnaires and focus groups. The study was conducted in the town of Sobral, Ceará, with the participation of 26 family physicians from 28 Basic Health Units and three psychiatry professors from Brazilian medical schools. Results: Most of the family doctors felt unprepared to solve mental health problems and identified major gaps in their medical training. They reported that the focus on mental health issues was insufficient, and centered on the hospital setting and healing, rather than in the context of community care. The educational program developed provides health teams and health education institutions with the conceptual, practical and methodological framework for primary-level mental health education initiatives. Conclusion: The tools to identify health learning needs proved useful in the development of continuing education programs together with primary health professionals. For the purposes of validation, it is suggested that this program be tested in different Brazilian cities followed by thorough evaluation.",

The scientific production around the world has become a great ally in medical education can be intensified in the medical internship. Evidence-based health includes the best scientific literature associated with clinical expertise and the patient's will. Evidence-based health it has aroused the need for the health care professional to upgrade through the medical literature, but many scientific literatures are being produced and published without quality evaluated. Knowing how to choose a literature through knowledge of his criticism helps the health care professional to optimize your time. It is in medical schools where the student has the place to learn to identify relevant factors to determine the best product and together with clinical learning to understand and discuss the best management of the patient. The question is the basis of the undergraduate student, followed by the search for better therapy, diagnostic exams, patient's quality of life and the prognosis of diseases. This universe is the thrust of undergraduate students interested in reading an article related to your question. The ease of searches in electronic databases helps in the best literature choice and brings the reader what is being produced by the scientific world. Learning how to critically evaluate scientific literature has become a major partner of undergraduate students in the search for new knowledge with scientific evidence of high quality. The importance in internship teaching of the critical evaluation of literature is to awake on us the interest in clinical research associated with knowledge of new technologies produced around the world, its application consciously to get a better quality of clinical care.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Academic Leagues are powerful strategies developed in health training, which integrate teaching, research and extension activities, carried out by the students and supervised by teachers. The objective of this work, therefore, is to investigate Brazilian scientific production about academic leagues in order to identify knowledge gaps. This is a study into the state of affairs based on searches in the Virtual Health Library and the CAPES Data Bank of Theses and Dissertations. The keyword ``academic leagues'' was used with the following guiding question: ``What scientific production is there regarding academic leagues?'' After detailed analysis, 24 pieces of work were selected for the final sample of the study. It was found that medicine stands out in the study of the theme, with the Brazilian Journal of Medical Education being the periodical that has published the most articles on the theme. It was also identified that the following types of study prevailed: case studies and editorial reports. The case studies were mainly related to experiences in leagues by specialties and undergraduate courses. Also of note were works regarding the standardization of the academic leagues, and academic leagues and health training as an object of study. Academic Leagues have been growing throughout Brazil, with an emphasis on medical courses as precursors to these initiatives. The main contributions they offer to health education are the promotion of training based on the reality with which future professionals will be engaged, the capacity to stimulate teamwork, critical reflection, and student autonomy. However, some challenges are recognized, such as early specialization and lack of effective teacher supervision. From the tripod of the university, academic leagues have the possibility to promote a differentiated health training, anticipating the insertion of the trainees in practical settings, and filling the knowledge gaps found in undergraduate training based on an autonomous student-led approach, besides providing teaching-service-community integration.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Graduating as a medical professional is admittedly an arduous task and involves great challenges, which begin in the process of entering university and extend throughout the long training process. In this essay, we revisit the classic model of the Hero's Journey, also known as monomyth. This model, proposed by the anthropologist Joseph Campbell and reviewed by the screenwriter Christopher Vogler, was used to describe and understand the different perceptions of the transformations undergone by medical scholars throughout the course. The present paper consists of an interpretative theoretical essay that seeks to correlate the experience of the training course of the medical student with the Hero's Journey. Even considering that the individual situations are experienced in unique ways, the analysis of the common aspects support the identification of aspects of collective experiences. There is no intention to prove any specific point, but rather to discuss how the stages of the monomyth present themselves in everyday academic life. What is sought is to interpret the experience of the formative course of a medical student from the perspective of the archetype of the hero, identifying the events that define the steps or steps in the Journey, according to Campbell's vision. The discussion brings to light the medical student's journey presented from the steps proposed initially: four acts containing 3 steps each. It is important to emphasize that the stages are not proposed as fixed or obligatory stages, but rather as being subject to scrambling, deletion or addition, without compromising the narrative. Thus, the main events of the trajectory of the medical student were compared to the expected events of the monomyth, emphasizing the symbolic character of the journey, which is primordial. The correspondences between the Hero's Journey and the academic experience were analyzed in terms of several similarities, supporting the discussion of the symbolic aspects of medical training and its impacts on the situations experienced by students, teachers and medical professionals and their repercussions on the doctor's relationship with society and with him or herself.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Clinical reasoning refers to the cognitive process by which the physician is able to provide a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment for a clinical problem. Despite the great medical knowledge evolution over the time, clinical practice is still very dependent on professional ability to make a correct diagnosis. Studies have shown that diagnostic errors are an important source of preventable diseases and death, promoting clinical and financial damage to patients, families and nation. Medical schools and teachers face the challenge of promoting the development of this competence in medical students as it is one of the greatest attributes to be developed during medical school. In the last three decades, the processes involved in learning and developing clinical reasoning have been studied and now much is known about the stages involved in the formation of this important skill. Theories and cognitive studies on memory building and function can be found in several areas of knowledge, however, little information exists with a discussion focused on medical education. The aim of this work is present a review of the main theories and researches on clinical reasoning, providing teachers with a comprehensive review that allows understanding this fascinating medical education area. It is hoped, to offer a contribution on medical education, providing medical teachers with technical material for planning their instructional strategies guided by clinical reasoning learning principles and stimulate research on medical education. To favor comprehension, the theories will be presented by topics, however, since clinical reasoning is a complex cognitive activity, it is important remember that the information proposed in each topic have factors that overlap and often occur simultaneously.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The present report seeks to share a successful experience of using the WhatsApp® application as a resource for medical education, highlighting the pedagogical and formative potential of social networks, not yet fully utilized by universities. This essay took the form of a class for undergraduate students of the medical course of the Federal University of Uberlândia that was conducted in the popular chat application WhatsApp®. This class had as its main theme Health Education in Media and its objectives were: to evaluate the knowledge previously formed by the students during the course Collective Health Module III and to verify, in practice, the effectiveness of a new social media as a means of Health Education. This Teaching Module focused on working with students' concepts and knowledge on Health Promotion, Popular Education in Health, Health Education, Prevention of diseases and social determinants of the health-sickness-care process. In order for the activity to be in line with the themes addressed in the Module, teachers and students debated whether moving from the classroom to a virtual space would be conducive to learning the theme and after reaching a consensus they collectively constructed the structure of the activity and how it should be conducted. Examples of health education actions conveyed in different media were shared in a WhatsApp® group to which the students and teachers involved were added. These actions aimed to guide the proposed debate, and the activity allowed a fluid and dynamic discussion, with intense contribution of all the participants. At the end of the class the students were very satisfied with the final results and considered the experiment very positive and profitable. This experience shows how new information and communication technologies, especially social networks, have the capacity to improve the teaching-learning process and bring new ways of interaction between educator and learners. We also hope that this report will encourage more teachers and students to explore the pedagogical and formative potential of social networks, which must be fully exploited.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Some authors have found close and positive relationship between religiosity and spirituality and healthy behaviors that result in good health. Furthermore, data drawn from the literature suggest that, in general, people rely on their beliefs to face moments of personal and collective difficulties. Professionals whose practices are linked to health care, need to be trained to meet and observe the needs of patients, in terms of religiosity and spirituality. Objective: To investigate what medical students as well as students in the health area think about this topic, in addition to identifying the role and importance they attribute to religiosity and spirituality in their lives and future professional practices. Methodology: This was a quantitative and qualitative, descriptive, cross intentional sample study. We applied a questionnaire to first-year students of medicine, biomedicine, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, physical education, nutrition, psychology and social service, which assessed socio-demographic variables and concepts involving religiosity and spirituality and health. For the data analysis, we used the Chi-Square test developed in SPSS version 2.0, and P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: We selected 270 students, aged between 18 and 43, however, only 183 completed the questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were female, who come from conventional Catholic and Christian families, and inherited their religion from their parents; 78.6\% (144/183) report religious affiliation, 43.5\% (87/183) practice it in a disciplined way. Most the individuals considered that R/S gives meaning to their lives, strengthens them in times of trouble and brings benefits to their health. They also consider religiosity and spirituality and issues related issues as very important to their academic background, whereas 31.4\% (57/183) quoted that religiosity and spirituality have influenced their professional choice. Conclusion: Those who have become students at the Universidade Federal do Triângulo Mineiro have a positive attitude towards religiosity and spirituality and expect a more comprhensive and spiritual approach towards their curriculum.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Historically speaking, Brazilian medical school curricula have not provided training aimed at working in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and Primary Care. This has been identified as one of the factors that hinders the work of medical graduates. Several curricular transformations have been taking place, but they have failed to cater for many health professionals. This research was an integral part of a master's thesis and was carried out through a descriptive, cross-sectional field study that aimed to analyze the training of the medical professional who responded to Module II of the National Program for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care (PMAQ-AB), cycle I and / or II, in the state of Paraná. The data were obtained through a semi-structured questionnaire made available online via the Qualtrics program. Of the 183 physicians who formed the universe, 32 (17.48\%) participated in the study. Among the respondent professionals, 16 (50\%) were graduates from public universities, 11 (34\%) from private institutions; 17 (53\%) graduated before 2006; 15 (46.9\%) considered the theoretical learning about the Unified Health System and the theoretical and practical learning about Primary Health Care (PHC) obtained during undergraduate training as lacking or insufficient; 13 (59.1\%) underwent up to one year of practical training as undergraduates; 14 (43.75\%) reported that they were adequately trained in the undergraduate program, but required updating training to work at this level of care; 12 (37\%) were resident doctors, 6 (50\%) in Family and Community Medicine; 21 (66\%) reported having a specialization, 2 (9\%) in family health, 3 (14\%) in collective health and 7 (32\%) in Family and Community Medicine; 23 physicians (71.8\%) chose to work in PHC for personal/professional fulfillment. It was concluded that the physicians participating in the field research consider their training on the SUS and the PHC work process as insufficient, and required complementary training for their professional performance. This fact shows that there is indeed a need for changes in the training process.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Traditional medical education is historically rooted in French positivism and the Flexner Report, which is currently reflected in the undergraduate division of the clinical and basic science sections. This division has been the object of constant debate over the last decades, making way for other models of medical education to be proposed and developed. There are many aspects of traditional medical education that are criticized, for example that it is excessively mechanistic, biologically and individual-oriented, hospital-centered and that it is geared towards precocious specialization. The disarticulation between the clinical and basic science sections, among these, is often highlighted. This disconnect prevents the content of the basic cycle from being transmitted in such a way as to remain applicable in the clinical section or future medical performance. This research intends to evaluate the integration between these two parts of medical training at the Federal University of Parana (UFPR) from the unique standpoint of the medical student, and assesses its influence on the quality of the education offered. A questionnaire developed by the authors, consisting of questions related to basic science teaching and tables that allow correlations to be made between basic science and clinical science, was applied to students in the last semester of the clinical setting. The tables correlate the disciplines in both individual and group terms in the semesters of the basic science section. Students were also asked to evaluate possible proposals that would increase the articulation between these sections. The main findings were as follows: 63\% of students considered that the basic science portion is of key importance to medical pratice; 77°\% report dissatisfaction with the teaching; 94\% considered that they had assimilated less than 60\% of the content taught during the basic science section, and 65\% of the students evaluated this assimilated content as not very useful; 52\% have thought about quitting medical school, half of them during the basic science period, and, of those, 44\% correlate this intention to a lack of integration between the sections. The overall analysis of the connection between the tables demonstrated an insignificant level of integration between 59\% of the disciplines. The individualized analysis of the tables, on the other hand, showed that the disciplines of Physiology, for example, were assessed as having an insignificant level of articulation by up to 70\% of the students, and when compared to the related clinical disciplines, that same evaluation corresponded to the opinion of up to 44\% of the students. Therefore, the basic science seems unable to transmit a suitable learning content that is appropriate for the clinical training. The result of the research reaffirms, through objective and quantitative data, the fragmentation present in the most traditional medicine schools. This paper revises the subject in the national and international setting, demonstrating its breadth, as well as inquiring and proposing approaches that can help in the integration between the sections, reviving key discussions that address the problems related to comprehensive medical education.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Studies on the teaching of pathology are scarce in Brazil and show a demotivating scenario for students and professors. Although it is fundamental for medical training, the distance between pathology and other clinical disciplines leads to students not recognizing the importance of pathology for their professional education, especially in the field of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the teaching-learning process of pathology in three medical schools in the state of Rio de Janeiro which offer traditional teaching, and its impact on the work of pathologists and infectious disease specialists. It is a qualitative study using the collective subject discourse technique in semi-structured interviews. We interviewed seven pathology professors from the three medical schools along with 10 physicians, five pathologists working in pathology laboratories and five infectious disease specialists from a referral center on infectious diseases in Rio de Janeiro. The discipline of pathology is taught in a non-contextualized manner limited to a few semesters. Professors recognize that non-contextualized classes neither stimulate interest in the specialty nor prepare students for interaction with pathologists and pathology laboratories. For infectious disease specialists, medical undergraduates' lack of perception regarding the importance of pathology leads to difficult interaction between pathologists and infectious disease specialists. This difficult interaction translates into incomplete histopathological requests, difficulty in interpreting pathology reports and inadequate sending of samples. Infectious disease specialists and pathologists believe that a focus on more practical activities, greater integration with clinical disciplines and the presence of pathologists in other learning scenarios would increase interest in pathology. All the professors and physicians surveyed acknowledged the existence of gaps in the teaching of pathology in medical schools and the need for a reformulation to make it a more interesting discipline and aligned with future practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The present study investigated the concepts and practices related to health promotion among professionals from nine Basic Health Units - BHU, that constitute the internship field of the Medical course of Rio Grande do Norte State University - UERN, in the town of Mossoró/RN. The findings are discussed from the perspective of new trends in Medical Education, Health and Care. This is an exploratory study with a qualitative approach, applying the thematic analysis technique for data analysis. The research subjects were twenty-five professionals who work in the Family Health Strategy - FHS. The results revealed three conceptual tendencies: Health Promotion assimilated as a form of disease prevention, a diffused concept of Health Promotion and, finally, an appropriate characterization. The practices included lectures with groups of patients, in the context of actions and programs, such as Hiperdia (addressing hypertension), health of the elderly and pregnant, and individual guidelines, provided both at the BHU and during home visits. The main challenges identified for health promotion included: the persistence of the biomedical model, the human resources deficit, the excess demand and absence of qualification mechanisms, which contribute toward team fragility and fragmentation. In conclusion, it is necessary to intensify efforts toward achieving a dialogical construction between Teaching, Services, Health Management and the Society, highlighting in the field of Medical Education the availability of instruments that support coordination between training institutions and the Health Services and offer mechanisms for integrated training and permanent education. The role of medical schools is reasserted: committed to consolidating the purposes of Health Promotion, aligned to the dialogical model of education for training medical professionals with a profile that society needs, and in favor of a healthier life and a better society.",

The women presented higher scores in the ``sharing'' aspect (3.97 ± 11.61) than the men (3.82 ± 1.54), with p = 0.034, and in the global mean, female (4.51 ± 1, 57) and male (4.40 ± 1.55), with p = 0.047. For the ``sharing'' factor, those who said they had completed extracurricular internship (3.98 ± 1.62) reported a better score than those who had not (3.81 ± 1.53), with p = 0.033. The students that specified social contribution as a factor in their decision to follow the medical course (4.00 ± 1.58) presented a better score in the ``sharing'' factor. Conclusion: Most of the intern students focused their attention on the doctor figure rather than the patient, especially with the lower scores at the end of the training period. By contrast, the academics believed that the patient's expectations, feelings, and life circumstances may interfere with their treatment. Women, students who performed extracurricular activities during the course and students who pointed out social contribution as a factor in their decision to follow a medical career, presented better results from the point of view of dialogue and allowing the patient to be part of the treatment.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Homeopathic medicine was recognized by the Federal Council of Medicine as a medical specialty in 1980, and since then its teaching as part of medical training has grown in Brazil. Homeopathic medicine was first taight in Brazil in 1994 in the undergraduate medicine program of the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF). The history of teaching Homeopathy in the UFF medical course was analyzed in a qualitative-approach case study using documental analysis, direct observation, individual interviews with coordinators and students, and focus groups with alumni from five disciplines that address Homeopathy. The path identified involved resistance and progress, triggered by the curricular reform process in context of the implementation of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and the expansion of primary care. The teaching of Homeopathy in the UFF medical course was supported by the collaboration of external professionals. The major challenges included consolidating the discipline on the compulsory curriculum, acheiving integration with other clinics, hiring qualified teachers and recreating an outpatient Homeopathy school environment for supervised practice. From the perspective of integration and complementarity of the biomedical approach, humanized medical practice and comprehensive care were the most mentioned contributions. In the compulsory subjects it is argued that students can develop skills and abilities to: (a) guide and refer patients to Homeopathy whenever they might benefit from this medical practice; and (b) hold dialogues with homeopathy colleagues concerning the monitoring of common patients. The optional subjects are important for students who want to broaden their theoretical and practical training in Homeopathy, aimed at offering a professional practice that includes this specialty and permits the integration of the vitalist and biomedical paradigms in health care. The teaching of Homeopathy in the UFF undergraduate medical program is supported by its academic community's commitment to a plural health education that enables future professionals to use different paradigms for dealing with the disease process, the body and people in a contemporary society. This, in turn, contributes to improving relationships with patients, promotes autonomy, reduces invasive and insensitive approaches and expands comprehensive health care and resolute health work. This critical study of the trajectory of Homeopathy education in the UFF undergraduate medical course adds support to reflections on its teaching in other medical schools, including schools that already contemplate Homeopathy in their schedule or schools that are planning to include it in their curriculum in response to student and teacher demand.",

Objetive: To conduct an overview with meta-analysis to compile evidence from multiple systematic reviews (SR) on the diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess acute chest pain in the emergency department (ED). Methods: We included SR of primary studies that evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of CCTA ≥ 64 channels in the ED. The studies were conducted in patients at low and intermediate risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Quality assessment was performed using PRISMA and approved reviews that scored ≥ 80\%. Two authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. Spearman correlation test, Chi-square test, Cochran's Q test or Higgins and Thompson statistical I2 were used. For meta-analysis, ``mada'' package statistical software R Core Team, 2015, was used. The significance level adopted was 95\%. Results: Four reviews were eligible for inclusion in this overview, resulting in 13 articles after applying the exclusion criteria, and only 10 of these were used for meta-analysis, adding up to a total of 4831 patients (mean age, 54 ± 6 years; 51\% male), of whom 46\% were hypertensive, 32\% had dyslipidemia, 13\% had diabetes and 26\% had a family history of premature CAD. In the meta-analysis, 9 studies defined CCTA positive in the presence of luminal lesions ≥ 50\%, while 1 study defined it as luminal lesions ≥ 70\%. Sensitivity ranged from 77\% to 98\%, and specificity, from 73\% to 100\%. The univariate analysis showed homogeneity of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) [Q = 8.5 (df = 9), p = 0.48 and I2 = 0\%]. The pooled mean DOR for CCTA in primary analyses was 4.33 (95\% CI: 3.47 - 5.18). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.982 (95\% CI: 0.967 - 0.999). There was no death, 29 (0.6\%) infarcts, 92 (1.9\%) revascularizations and 312 (6.4\%) invasive coronary angiographies. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome occurred in 7.3\% of the 1655 patients included in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: The use of CCTA as a tool for stratification of patients at low or intermediate cardiovascular risk, who are in the ED with chest pain, has high accuracy, safety, reduces length of hospital stay and probably the costs, producing an early diagnosis and more effective decision making.

 abstract = "Abstract Background: Data on the current situation of nuclear medicine practices in cardiology in Brazil are scarce. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recommended eight ``good practices'' to minimize patients' ionizing radiation exposure during myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS). Objectives: To assess the adoption of the eight good practices in MPS in Brazil. Methods: Cross-sectional study with data obtained by use of a questionnaire. All hypothesis tests performed considered a significance level of 5\%. Results: We observed that 100\% of the nuclear medicine services (NMS) assessed do not use thallium-201 as the preferred protocol. Regarding the use of technetium-99m, 57\% of the NMS administer activities above the threshold recommended by the IAEA (36 mCi) or achieve an effective dose greater than 15 millisievert (mSv). The abbreviated stress-only myocardial perfusion imaging is not employed by 94\% of the NMS; thus, only 19\% count on strategies to reduce the radioactive doses. Approximately 52\% of the NMS reported always performing dose adjustment for patient's weight, while 35\% administer poorly calculated doses in the one-day protocol. Conclusion: A considerable number of NMS in Brazil have not adopted at least six practices recommended by the IAEA. Despite the difficulties found in nuclear practice in some Brazilian regions, almost all obstacles observed can be overcome with no cost increase, emphasizing the importance of developing strategies for adopting ``good practices'' when performing MPS.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: The primary objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of cases admitted to hospital with cauda equina syndrome (CES) at the Institute of Orthopedics and Traumatology (IOT) from 2005 to 2015. Secondly, this article is a continuation of the epidemiological work of the same base published in 2013, and will be important for other comparative studies to a greater understanding of the disease and its epidemiology. Methods: This was a retrospective study of the medical records of admissions due to CES at IOT in the period 2005-2015 with diagnosis of CES and neuropathic bladder. The following variables were analyzed: gender, age, etiology of the disease, topographic level of the injury, time interval between injury and diagnosis, presence of neurogenic bladder, time interval between diagnosis of the CES and surgery, and reversal of the deficit or of the neurogenic bladder. Results: Since this is a rare disease, with a low global incidence, it was not possible, just with the current study to establish statistically significant correlations between the variables and outcomes of the disease. However, this study demonstrates the shortcomings of the Brazilian public health system, both with the initial management of these patients and the need for urgent surgical treatment. Conclusion: The study shows that despite well-defined basis for the conduct of CES, a higher number of sequelae caused by the pathology is observed in Brazil. The delay in diagnosis and, therefore, for definitive treatment, remains as the major cause for the high number of sequelae. Level of evidence: 4, case series.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth (Piperaceae) is widely distributed throughout Brazil. In addition to its ecological importance, it is used in folk medicine and a great number of its biological activities have been already proved. Thus, the aim of this research was to investigate the effect of seasonality on the content of essential oil (EO) in leaves of Piper gaudichaudianum and ascertain the possible influence of the drying process of the plant material in the yield of this extractive. Leaves were randomly collected from individuals of a native population in Santa Maria, RS state, Brazil, along a year. The EO was extracted from fresh and dried leaves by hydrodistillation. When reproductive organs were observed, they were extracted in order to examine their influence on the yield of leaf EO. To determine the moisture content (MC\%), 20 g of leaves and 10g of reproductive organs were dried separately in an oven at 50°C until constant weight. The yield of leaf EO (\% w/ w) was calculated for the fresh material based on the dry weight considering the MC\%, and for the dried material at room temperature. Only small seasonal variations in EO content was detected for the analyzed samples, with no statistical difference between them. The highest yield was observed in the spring for EO from the leaves (1.61 ± 0.09\%), and from the reproductive organs (5.17\%), while the lowest yields of leaf EO occurred in the summer (1.32 ± 0.14\%), the only season which showed no presence of the reproductive organs. The absence of significant difference between the yields indicates no quantitative seasonal variability in production of EO in leaves of this population. However, yields did not differ statistically, indicating no seasonal variability of the EO content of the leaves of this population. Therefore, the collection of this plant organ can be performed at any time of the year in order to obtain this extractive. Since there was no decrease in the content of EO during the drying process at room temperature, this post-harvest processing can be adopted.",

This categorization was conceived as an ideal Weberian type, guided by Levi-Strauss's dynamics of symbolic effectiveness. We conceptualized six constituent movements of clinical encounters: (1) user's acceptance; (2) demand listening; (3) problem investigation; (4) diagnosis elaboration and interpretation; (5) socialization of interpretation; and (6) therapy elaboration, agreement and implementation. These constituent movements can be associated with Madel Luz's medical rationality dimensions (cosmology, doctrine, physiology, morphology, diagnostic and therapeutic systems), allowing the description, analysis and comparison of various clinical practices, guided by one or more medical rationalities. Therefore, this analytical instrument could facilitate the investigation and understanding of clinical practices within different medical systems, contributing to both comparability of different medical practices and to its general effectiveness.",

All normal and subluxation radiographic images were randomized, and submitted to subjective analysis. It was observed that the anatomical parameter with the highest correlation is the length of the spinous process of the axis, obtaining a mean value of 0.056 index and 0.019 standard deviation. Index mean value obtained in dogs with the disease of 0.287 and standard deviation of 0.123. The subjective analysis revealed 88.89\% to 95.24\% agreement, while the result obtained by the CCD formula was shown to be 100\% effective in the diagnosis of SAA.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The fungi Rhodotorula sp was considered nonpathogenic, but with the increase of immunosuppressed humans in the last two decades, the species R. mucilaginosa, R. glutinis and R. minuta became potentially pathogenic agents. There have been few veterinary clinical reports associated with Rhodotorula spp. and this work aims to describe the first case of fungal dermatitis caused by R. glutinis in immunosuppressed dog due to visceral leishmaniasis and osteosarcoma in the city of Cuiabá-Mato Grosso. An 11-year-old male mongrel dog was examined to the Veterinary Hospital with skin lesions and the diagnosis was dermatophytosis and the treatment was implemented with topical tea tree oil for one month, but the treatment failed. The animal returned to the Veterinary Hospital with bleeding in the injured area of the tail and biopsy was performed for microbiological and histopathology evaluation. In the microbiological and histopathological analysis, yeast was isolated and yeast-like structures in silver staining were observed, respectively. The isolated yeast was identified as R. glutinis by DNA sequencing. A new treatment was implemented without clinical improvement. The animal was diagnosed with leishmaniasis and osteosarcoma, which probably caused immunosuppression, and its clinical conditions evolved to death.",

Samples were made during the dry season (September/ December 2015) and rainy season (March/ June 2016). They were captured 40 specimens of S. herzbergii at two different points of the estuarine complex: A1) Itaqui port (potentially contaminated area); A2) Igarapé do Puca, Alcântara (control area). Abiotic variables were recorded: salinity, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. In the laboratory, the gills of each species were fixed in 10\% formaldehyde and kept in 70\% alcohol until the usual histological technique was performed. The gill alterations identified in the fish of the potentially contaminated area were: epithelial displacement (DE), congestion (CO), aneurysm (AN), lamellar fusion (FL), hyperplasia (HI), capillary dilation (DC), necrosis and epithelial cell proliferation (PCE). The changes in the control region were: epithelial displacement (DE), lamellar fusion (FL), necrosis (NE) and epithelial cell proliferation (PCE). Gill alterations were more frequent in the port region (84\%) than in the control region (16\%). These results indicate that fish from the potentially contaminated area are presenting biological responses to local stress.",

The diagnosis is usually through abdominal palpation although it is not very accurate, thus ultrasound provides a valuable complementary exam to establish a precise diagnosis of location and extent of intra-abdominal umbilical diseases. Given those facts and the lack of established standards for umbilical ultrasound imaging the present study proposal was to standardize the physiological aspects of umbilical components during involution. Ultrasound images were obtained for 23 Holstein calves, from birth until 30 days of life. Iodine tincture of different concentrations was used for umbilical region antisepsis. Results show that umbilical vein and arteries lose their vessel characteristics, becoming similar to ligament, due to the proliferation of fibrous tissue. The growth pattern of the fibrous tissue was from the vessel walls growing toward vascular lumen. The involution process begins at the most distant part and did not vary with antiseptic concentrations. To obtain a reliable ultrasound exam it's important to know the aspects of imaging patterns according to each phase of umbilical involution, thus leading to an accurate diagnosis of structural variations and umbilical diseases.",

The osteosynthesis of the femur was performed with a combination of two Steinmann pins, as modified Rush technique, and a dynamic compression plate. The surgical techniques used were satisfactory for stabilization, consolidation of both fractures and function return of the member. Ninety days after surgery the animal was reintroduced to nature.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to compare three analytical methods to determine serum in refrigerated raw milk. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), acidic and colorimetric ninhydrin methods were applied. A collection of 100 samples of raw milk from cooled expansion tanks took place. The results showed that 10 samples (14.7\%) were negative and 58 (85.3\%) were positive for the acidic ninhydrin method. The mean sialic acid content found in the ninhydrin technique was 5.58μg/mL, with a more frequent value of 2.70μg/mL. From all 68 HPLC negative samples, two were positive (2.94\%) and 66 (97.06\%) negative to the colorimetric method. The relative frequency of positive samples was 32\%, HPLC had the highest mean serum levels (14.37\%), followed by the colorimetric method (5.28\%) and acid ninhydrin (3.12\%). The high-performance liquid chromatography method was different from the acid and colorimetric ninhydrin methods. The ninhydrin and colorimetric methods were not different from each other, both of which could be used as screening methodologies. Among the three techniques, HPLC was the most sensitive methodology for the detection and quantification of serum in refrigerated raw milk.",

For the diagnosis of infection by Campylobacter fetus subsp. venrealis and Tritrichomonas foetus the samples were submitted to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) grown in Columbia agar plus antibiotics and Diamond, respectively. There was an occurrence of 1.8\% (2/113) of positive animals in the microbiological examination with confirmation by PCR, for C. fetus subsp. venerealis. We observed that 100\% of positive samples were from two (2) males from the same herd. No animals were positive for T. foetus. This is the first report of infection with C. fetus subsp. venerealis in buffaloes in Brazil.

Image diagnostic exams to evaluate biliary tract, like ultrasound, conventional X-ray and CT, have been used in veterinary medicine with some restrictions such as low sensibility, and in many regions unfeasibility of achievement. Due to this, most of the pacients with biliary obstruction sings are submitted to surgical procedure before an accurate diagnostic of the disease. This paper aimed to standardize and describe the percutaneous transcolecystic cholangiography in dogs that consists in the injection of contrast inside of the gall bladder guided by ultrasound. It allows to see all the bililary tract, using X-ray. The technique was performed 10 times in six clinical healthy dogs. The puncture was performed in the 9th intercostal right space near to the sternum using a 20G catheter, the dose was 1ml per 4kg. After contrast injection, serial radiographs of the abdominal region were made, in left lateral projection and ventrodorsal, the first projections were performed immediately after contrast injection and repeated after five and ten minutes. No animal showed any side effect due to the technique, this was confirmed by observation and by hepatic function evaluation. The technique was considered efficacious to visualize all the biliary tree and to see any possible obstruction in ill dogs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT: Vector-borne diseases have been emerging and reemerging all over the world, causing a challenge to veterinary and human medicine. Among these diseases are those caused by agents of the order Rickettsiales, obligatory intracellular Gram-negative bacteria, with ability to infect several animals and humans. Rickettsiales of the species Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. residing in cytoplasmic vacuoles of leukocytes and platelets. Rickettsiales of the species Rickettsia spp. freely infect cytoplasm or nucleus of host cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the natural infection with Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. in captive wild felids at the Federal District and Goiás, Brazil. In addition, it was also aimed to relate possible changes in hemogram with the presence of these agents. Blood samples from 34 animals were analyzed by PCR to detect the presence of DNA from these agents. The DNA of Ehrlichia canis was detected in 5.8\% (2/34) of samples. A. platys was detected in 64.7\% (22/34), A. phagocytophilum was detected in 5.8\% (2/34). The DNA of Rickettsia spp. was not detected in any sample. Two felides presented co-infection with E. canis and A. platys, and two presented co-infection with A. platys and A. phagocytophilum. There were no significant differences in hematological data from positive and negative samples. The data suggest that captive wild felids can serve as potential reservoirs for Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp., despite hematological abnormalities were not observed.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in the world and in Brazil, after non-melanoma skin cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the medical students' perception of breast cancer and breast reconstruction. Methods: This is a cross-sectional pilot study composed of students from the fifth and sixth year of medical school, in May 2016. Results: We questioned whether there is a possibility of breast reconstruction after mastectomy, and the response was unanimous (100\%). For a better characterization, we asked if the reconstruction could be done at the same time as the mastectomy, and 69 (57.5\%) students said yes and 51 (42.5\%) denied. In the analysis of surgical knowledge, we asked whether they knew any breast reconstruction technique, and 49 (40.83\%) answered yes and 71 (59.16\%) denied knowing. With regard to referral to a medical specialist who was better prepared to follow and perform breast reconstruction, 93 (77.5\%) students chose plastic surgery and 26 (21.66\%) chose mastology. Regarding the possibility of breast reconstruction in patients who need to undergo adjuvant radiotherapy, 66 (55\%) answered yes, 51 (42.5\%) did not answer, and three (2.5\%) did not know how to respond. Regarding this possibility in patients with silicone implants, 59 (49.16\%) answered yes, three (2.5\%) answered no, and 58 (48.33\%) said they did not know about the subject. Conclusion: We conclude that mastology has been gaining immense interest in the field of breast reconstruction, including in the academic world, based on the high percentage of respondents who stated that they are better prepared for this procedure than for plastic surgery for breast reconstruction.",

The material analyzed comprises expectations of 72 students collected by an invitation to write freely about what they expect from the discipline. The result shows the dominance of discourses and pedagogical experience that contribute to production of an `instrumental' and `colonial' conception of the medical practice and allows us to understand some difficulties to the critical-reflexive exercise of social science in the medical education. Identifying the need to deconstruct this `logic', the article concludes not with a concrete pedagogical proposal, but with the indication of the need for a process of deinstitutionalization/ institutionalization oriented to epistemic `decompression' of the field of health in general and medical education in particular, an opening to other agents, other epistemologies and to the possibility of new productive connections in the field of health and medicine.",

 abstract = "Abstract Objective: To verify the trajectory of the functional capacity of elderly persons hospitalized due to clinical conditions in a university hospital. Method: A descriptive, prospective cohort study was conducted between 2015 and 2016. Elderly patients admitted to the Hospital das Clínicas of Botucatu Medical School (Unesp), Brazil, were evaluated for the functional assessment of basic activities of daily living (BADL) using the Katz scale, nutritional status (body mass index (BMI)) and presence of the Frailty Syndrome (FS) (Fried criteria). A description of the trajectory of functional capacity was carried out at four times: 15 days before admission (T0), at admission (T1), at hospital discharge (T2) and 30 days after discharge (T3). Results: 99 elderly people with a mean age of 74 (+7.35) years, 59.6\% of whom were male, were evaluated. Of these, 81.8\% presented functional independence at T0, 45.5\% at T1, 57.6\% at T2 and 72.8\% at T3. According to their functional trajectories, 28.2\% of the elderly lost functional capacity between T0 and T3. There was an association between worsening of functional capacity between T0 and T3 and the FS (RR 4.56; 95\% CI 1.70-12.26, p=0.003). Conclusion: Elderly patients have worse functional capacity at hospital discharge than before hospitalization. About 28.0\% of the elderly had worse functional capacity 30 days after discharge than 15 days before admission. The elderly with Frailty Syndrome have a greater risk for worse functional capacity results 30 days after discharge.",

A significant difference was found when comparing the bone mineral density obtained over the study time. Formation of vascular network between the bioceramic pores was observed by the first evaluation time, (eight days). Primary bone tissue and trabeculae were observed from preexisting bone tissue after 30 days of implantation.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The classification ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) is an important tool for assessing a patient's pre anesthetic. Thus, it is used in many studies because it has close relation with anesthetic morbidity and mortality. This classification was performed on 243 canine patients undergoing surgical procedures at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The results obtained were as follows: ASA I (38, 15.64\%), ASA II (53; 21.81\%), ASA II Emergency (E) (2; 0.82\%), ASA III (78; 32.10\%), ASA III E (23; 9.46\%), ASA IV (11; 4.53 \%), ASA IV E (36; 14.81\%), and ASA V (2; 0.82\%). Most patients were ASA III (moderate systemic disease), demonstrating that in the analyzed service the most operated animals are carriers of disease. The mortality rate was 2.46\%, with most deaths occurring postoperatively and in patients with an emergency. The greatest risks are related to patients with more severe categories of the classification ASA, in emergency surgery, and especially in the postoperative period.",

The aim of this study was to test, through biomechanical axial compression and bending which is the ideal connector bar diameter PMMA, correlated to bone diameter for use in type Ia ESF. Twenty-four humerus were used to make measurements of length, diameter, circumference, and biomechanical testing. After the bars confected with 1.5 times the average diameter of the bone (group I), the same diameter (group II) and 0.5 times the diameter of the bone (group III). With the obtained results, using GII and GIII results, it was observed that the connector bars in group II were more resistant than the bones in the compression test. In the bending test, the bones resisted flexion strength when compared to group III and the group II was 4.3 times more resistant than group III in the same mechanical test. The results allow a direction for making bars considering bone diameter as a reference.",

The treatments were: T1=daily fed animals (control), T2=fed for six days and one day of restriction (6F/1R), T3=fed for five days and two days of restriction (5F/2R) and T4=fed for four days with three days of restriction (4F/3R). With five replicates each, and five fish for each experimental unit, arranged in a completely randomized design. In accordance with treatments, the fishes were fed twice a day at 08:00am and 4:00pm. The data collection for the performance evaluation was based on final weight, weight gain, average feed intake, alimentary conversion, total length, standard length, height, index head, index profile, protein efficiency rate, specific growth rate and survival at the end of the experimental period. Results were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (P≥5). Treatment 5F/2R resulted in the best performance results, which is a tool in reducing production costs without loss in performance of tambaqui juvenile.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Brucellosis in sheep has received a major focus, since it is a disease that affects the reproductive system of animals, causing serious impairment in the productive sector. Thus, three methods for the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis were evaluated as goal, the indirect Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISAi) test, the Immunodiffusion Agar Gel (AGID) technique and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Therefore, we used 211 sheep blood samples from properties of nine municipalities of the homogeneous micro-region of Teresina, Piaui. The 211 blood samples were subjected to serologic testing and PCR to detect anti-B. ovis antibodies, and Brucella ovis DNA, respectively. Positive results in serological tests were obtained, 36 (17\%) positive in the AGID test and seven (3.3\%) positive to the ELISAi test, however, there were no positive results in the PCR technique. Of the diagnostic methods used in this study, the AGID test was the one that presented the best performance in the detection of reactive animals, when compared to ELISAi and PCR in blood samples and, the percentage of seropositive animals suggests a wide distribution of Brucella ovis infected sheep in the study region and could cause loss to producers.",

It appears that the number of primary pulmonary neoplasms is increasing in companion animals, due to the increase in life expectancy, improvement of diagnostic techniques and greater contact with air pollutants. This study was realized to identify, analyze the frequency, and to characterize pathological and immunohistochemical findings of primary pulmonary neoplasms in dogs of the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. From January 2003 to June 2016, 6,037 necropsies were performed and in 36 of them primary pulmonary neoplasm was found. The most frequent neoplasm in this study was papillary adenocarcinoma (30.5\%) followed by lepidic adenocarcinoma (22.2\%). The age of affected dogs ranged from 4 to 16 years, with a mean of 11 years. The frequency of male dogs (63.9\%) prevailed over females (36.1\%). Through immunohistochemical evaluation all epithelial neoplasms were positive for pancytokeratin, 70.6\% were positive for thyroid-1 transcription factor and 23.5\% had co-expression of pancytokeratin and vimentin. Two mesenchymal tumors showed immunostaining for vimentin and S-100, were negative for smooth-muscle actin and melan-A immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome histochemical technique and were diagnosed as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, rarely found as primary lung tumor in animals. If one has difficulty to establish a diagnosis only through routine histological examination, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the immunohistochemical technique for the diagnosis of primary pulmonary neoplasms in dogs.",

Method: a documentary analysis of the literature on general competencies in palliative care was initially carried out, to construct a framework with suggestions of essential competencies for undergraduate education in Brazil. The elaborated material was then presented individually to eight professionals from a range of areas for analysis. All the professionals had specialized training in palliative care, and the material was accompanied by an interview with three open questions. The categorical thematic content analysis proposed by Bardin was used in the documentary analysis and the interviews with the professionals. Results: the initial documentary analysis resulted in five categories, eight subcategories and 96 units of analysis, based on which the researcher was able to construct the suggestions for competences, which were distributed with their respective contents in a framework with five modules. Six categories, 12 subcategories and 168 analysis units emerged from the interviews with the professionals following a reading of the material. From the discourse contained in the subcategories and units of analysis, suggestions emerged for a better distribution of the modules, resulting in the renaming of the same (Basic principles of palliative care, Symptom management, Teamwork, Ethical and legal issues, Care in the last moments of life). Conclusion: the discussion and improvement of the palliative care competencies suggested in this study will be essential at medical education forums, providing clarity about what is really required in general practitioner training.",

Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of the transplants performed between 06/17/87 to 07/31/16, totaling 1,046 transplants, subdivided into four different periods: 1) 1987 to 2000: cyclosporine with azathioprine; 2) 2001 to 2006: cyclosporine with mycophenolate; 3) 2007 to 2014: tacrolimus with antimetabolic; and 4) 2015 to 2016: tacrolimus with antimetabolic, with increased use of the combination of tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors. Results: There was an increase in the mean age of recipients and increase in deceased donors and their age in the last two periods. There was a reduction in graft function delay, being 54.3\% in the fourth period, compared to 78.8\% in the first, p = 0.002. We found a reduction in acute rejection, being 6.1\% in the last period compared to 36.3\% in the first, p = 0.001. Urological complications and diabetes after transplantation were more frequent in the first two periods. The rates of cytomegalovirus infection were higher in the last two periods. There was an improvement in graft survival, p = 0.003. There was no difference in patient survival, p = 0.77 (Figure 2).

For this, 40 sedentary adult male rats were equally and randomized into four groups subjected to 90min swimming or rest and administered aqueous resveratrol (100mg/kg/day) or saline for 14 days: N-RV-, rats maintained at rest and administered saline; N-RV+, rats maintained at rest and treated with resveratrol; N+RV-, rats subjected to physical exercise and administered saline; and N+RV+, rats subjected to physical exercise and treated with resveratrol. In sedentary rats, the physical exertion of swimming promoted oxidative stress, i.e. increased lipid peroxidation and decreased plasma total antioxidant capacity, and significant increases in CK and LDH plasma activities. Resveratrol diminished lipid peroxidation and the concentrations of muscle damage markers (CK and LDH) in sedentary rats subjected to swimming. The results provide evidence that a single sudden physical exertion can cause oxidative stress in sedentary rats.

Therefore, 50 Lewis rats were distributed in the following groups: negative control (NC), treatment with placebo (PLA), chondroitinase (CDT), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and chondroitinase associated with mesenchymal stem cells (CDT + MSC). All animals had their spinal cord exposed by laminectomy, and the groups named PLA, CDT, MSC and CDT + MSC also suffered compressive spinal cord trauma. After seven days, the spinal cord was re-exposed, when the PLA and MSCs groups received 4uL of artificial cerebrospinal fluid through the lesion, and the CDT group and CDT + MSC received the same fluid containing 2,2U of chondroitinase. 14 days after the first surgery, all animals received 0.2ml of PBS intravenously; however, the MSC and CDT + MSC groups received the same liquid also containing 1x106 MSCs. The motor skills were evaluated up to 28 days post-injury and, subsequently, the spinal cords were analyzed by RT-PCR for BDNF, NT-3, VEGF, PECAM-1 and KDR gene expression quantification, immunohistochemistry to detect injected stem cells GFP (anti-GFP), to quantify neurons (anti-NeuN), GFAP and detect vimentin in order to evaluate the glial scar. Statistical analyzes were performed by Prism 5 for Windows using a 5\% level of significance. There was no difference between groups with regarding motor capacity. The CDT + MSC group showed increased immunoreactivity of viable neurons than placebo. In MSC, there was a greater expression of neurotrophic factors BDNF and VEGF. Also, there was less vimentin immunostaining in group CDT. It was concluded that CDT + MSC association promotes neuronal viability after trauma, in which treatment with MSC promotes increased expression of BDNF and VEGF trophic factors, and also that treatment with chondroitinase is effective in reducing the glial scar.",

Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out between August and November, 2016 at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), in the metropolitan area of Recife, Pernambuco. Twenty-two elderly women (aged 66.2±3.5 years) diagnosed with breast cancer using hormone therapy received an instructional manual composed of 12 exercises, to be performed independently and at home to improve physical fitness. The manual was delivered at the first consultation and after six weeks its reproducibility was checked by a physical education professional and a physiotherapist who assessed the ``right'' or ``wrong'' execution of the movements. Results: The results were analyzed by Cohen's kappa coefficient (k). There was an ``almost perfect'' inter-rater relationship (higher than 0.88) across all 12 exercises. As regards the ``right'' execution of movements, six exercises presented inter-rater agreement with variation between 68.2\% and 90.9\%; on the other hand, as regards the ``wrong'' execution, the variation was between 54.4\% and 68.2\%. In addition, two exercises resulted in 50\% for ``right'' and ``wrong''. Regarding schooling, only exercise 6 had statistical significance (p-value=0.03). Conclusions: The manual of home physical exercises seems to be reproducible in elderly women with breast cancer at all levels of schooling, to improve physical fitness and promote functional self-care.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of hemolysis ``in vitro'' on the main plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress (BPEO) dogs. For this purpose, whole blood samples from 19 healthy dogs were hemolyzed in different degrees by mechanical action. Control samples containing low concentration of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in plasma were compared with four degrees of hemolysis (<0.36, from 0.36 to 0.60, 0.61 to 1.0, 1.1 to 4g/L Hb). Immediately after causing hemolysis, plasma concentrations of uric acid (UA), albumin, bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant concentration (TOC) were measured. The relative errors caused by several levels of hemolysis were calculated and compared with the total acceptable error (TAE) and allowed error limit (LEP) by employees in quality control programs for laboratory tests. Even small levels of hemolysis generate unacceptable analytical error (TAE and / or LEP) in BPEO measured, except for bilirubin. Hemolysis is a limiting factor for the assessment of systemic oxidative stress measured in plasma and may cause errors that potentially compromise clinical diagnosis.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: One of the greatest expectations of the medical student is having contact with the patient. This contact traditionally materializes in the discipline of medical semiology. This article intends to identify the experiences, opinions and adverse situations faced by fourth-semester students in order to propose coping strategies for these dilemmas within undergraduate training. Methodology: A descriptive, qualitative study, with a sample of 87 fourth-semester students from the undergraduate medical course at UFPB, who composed 12 focus groups. The discussions were transcribed for further analysis. The material produced was submitted for simple Descending Hierarchical Classification (DHC) with the aid of Iramuteq software version 0.6. Results: DHC split the corpus into five classes: Patient; Student; Methodology; Recognition; and Physical Examination. The students reported the following as barriers in their initial experiences: choice of patients for the first anamneses; believing that they were not helping the patient; fear of disturbing the patient; difficulty in distinguishing between what is normal and what is pathological; problems in the teaching methodology; the challenge of dealing with the emotional; and physical contact with the patient and technical difficulties in the physical examination. Discussion: Feeling incompetent and incapable of helping to treat the patient causes anxiety, anguish, frustration, insecurity, doubt and fear in the student, making it difficult to cope in their initial contact with patients. Such conditions undermine both the learning and mental health of the student and, depending on how they are dealt with, may interfere in their medical training and practice. Final considerations: Upon first contact with the patient the student needs skills that he or she does not feel capable of performing. Thus, several feelings are experienced that limit the learning process, which is progressive, but happens in a real life scenario, where demands are presented in a comprehensive manner. For this reason, platforms for discussion are fundamental for student doctors to have a support network to resolve the stress of contact with the patient and the challenges of dealing with their illnesses. Greater integration between teachers and students is necessary for the best use of classes in practical settings, as well as respect for the student's own limitations, so that they are not deemed as inadequate.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Palliative Care as an approach which, by preventing and alleviating suffering, improves the quality of life of patients and their families who face problems associated with life-threatening illnesses. In Brazil, Palliative Medicine has recently been promoted to the category of medical specialty, obliging Brazilian medical schools to review the educational concepts associated to end-of-life care. The personal relationship with death seems to directly influence the premise of care-more-than-healing, as an essential element of the caregiver's relationship with the terminal patient. There is a close relationship between anxiety and fear of death and the medical student's attitude in the face of end-of-life situations. The scholar's view of death may determine their inner disposition, values, concepts, and prejudices regarding death and dying and determine their performance as a professional. Thus, medical education programs must emphasize not only the theoretical-technical aspects in Palliative Care, but also the emotional climate that involves the medics' attitudes and actions in end-of-life situations. Objective: To compare the attitudes of medical students when faced with death and the process of dying according to their theoretical and/or practical training in Palliative Care. Method: A cohort study evaluating how the profile of medical students has changed based on questionnaires on Fear of Death and Self-Efficacy in Palliative Care. Results: Theoretical reflection reduces anxiety related to practical activity (p < 0.05). Communication and multidisciplinary skills in Palliative Care are performed far better by those who receive complete theoretical and practical training than those who are trained only in theoretical terms or those who rely exclusively on in-service learning (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The Palliative Care discipline helps students overcome fears related to death, thus reducing their anxiety when practicing end-of-life care, especially in terms of communication. Students who receive this theoretical and practical training. Students who receive theoretical and practical training in Palliative Care show greater confidence when faced with end-of-life situations.",

In this context, ``Mediarte: with Love and Humor'' is an outreach project which aims to practice play therapy, music therapy and clown therapy in the pediatric ward of a university hospital. In addition to transforming the children's lives (routine), it also has the potential to positively influence the project's volunteers – medical students at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of this project on the medical training and personal development of the volunteers, based on the Brazilian National Guidelines of Medical Training (DCN). Thus, a qualitative study was conducted in the form of semi-structured interviews and the content was analyzed in line with Bardin's proposals. Three themes were analyzed: ``Why am I here?'' ``What have I learned?'' and ``What barriers have I found?'' The results showed that the volunteers are keen to have an early opportunity to be placed in the health care environment and interact with kids, as important aspects that attracted them to the project, as well as the chance to develop abilities such as communication, humanized care and doctor-patient relationship skills. As a challenge, for example, the students described the need to adapt their behavior while playing with ill children, who, despite their own limitations, never lose the sparkle in their eyes during the proposed activities. The study concluded that the project helped the volunteers develop some of the key competencies and skills required by the new DCN. These results can be used to encourage the practice of ``Mediarte'' as an additional educational strategy to meet the current demands of complex, extended medical training. It also serves as a successful example that may stimulate the implementation of similar projects at other medical schools throughout Brazil.",

In 2013, the National Policy on Popular Education in Health (PNEPS) broadened the achievements in this area by reaffirming the principles of the System: universality, comprehensiveness, equality and social participation, essential to the debate on Popular Education in Health. According to the National Curricular Guidelines (DCN) for Medical Undergraduate Courses from 2014, the University's role is fundamental in training students to act on the needs of the population, promoting health, transforming the outlook of society, and their relations with the community. The group that conducted this study raised the proposal to reflect on the reality of the SUS from the perspective of Youth and Adult Education students (EJA) from the municipal schools of Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, drawing on their learnings to empower the population through shared knowledge. In the experiences, we identified a lack of knowledge among the public in relation to their rights and the SUS. Thus, we prioritized the debate and dialogue focusing on the PNEPS principle of lovingness in order to work on the principles of the health system and the public's rights in relation to health. It was revealed that our training remains doctor-centered, bearing in mind the initial difficulty in establishing comfortable contact on both sides. By virtue of working with people, demonstrations of dissatisfaction with our health system naturally arose and these were used to identify possible solutions and how to lead the way in this struggle without transferring the responsibility for improving and consolidating health care solely into the hands of third parties. We needed to understand the importance of the SUS and how to change it through, primarily, social participation. The goal was achieved by establishing a bond that enabled the joint construction of knowledge, bringing greater autonomy to both the group and the participants, broadening our perspective of a change in the fight for health that we strive for in our undergraduate training and our future medical practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical courses in Brazil have implemented subjects and modules that aim to bring students closer to actual national health concerns, as one way of adapting to the growing needs for medical training reorganization. Thus, this article reports on the experience of medical students at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC) [State University of Santa Cruz] with activities and actions included in the Health Care Network and Management module, part of the Teaching-Service-Community Intergration Practice (PIESC), as a proposal for the reorientation of the curriculum and acquisition of leadership skills and management of physical and human resources in health. The proposal was to insert the students at different levels of technological complexity of the Unified Health System (SUS) in order to contextualize the study of the Health Care Network (RAS) through experiences and action research in health services located at different care levels. Semi-structured interviews with professionals and users were therefore performed in each visited environment. These experiences served to broaden the students' vision of health care networks, enabling a better understanding of how the services are structured, as well as of the magnitude of the obstacles found in different scenarios, providing an in loco experience of the criticisms and difficulties faced by users and professionals. It was noticed that user health problems are often not resolved within the health care services, and the users lack understanding of their health rights. A lack of continuity of the health care was also observed through the various health care levels. Thus, it is concluded that the instances of primary care fail to offer adequate gateway services, culminating in the breakdown of the observed network. The experiment reported in this article demonstrated a dynamic way to approach the issue of Health Care Network Management, contributing to medical student training, as it enabled a better understanding of the network in terms of the health practices and the dimensions of the health-disease process involved in the management of the SUS.",

OBJECTIVE: To identify the maternal health care needs among the quilombola population, appreciating the local culture, values and knowledge. To set a care strategy with student participation which contemplates the identified needs in the quilombola community. To describe the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for the development of cultural competencies related to maternal health care of quilombola women. METHODS: Action research for the implantation of interprofessional prenatal care services with student participation, based on the needs of the quilombola community of Capoeiras, in Macaiba (RN). The information gathered was analyzed qualitatively by means of content analysis, with a priori definition of the thematic categories. RESULTS: The formation of affective bonds between users and the health team, and communication skills that help enable reflection were found as the main needs for culturally competent behavior in maternal care of the quilombola community. The medical students' opportunity to learn about the health of the quilombola people and to have an interprofessional work experience proved to be effective strategies to leverage the development of cultural skills in medical training. CONCLUSIONS: The training of health professionals capable of interacting effectively with ethnically diverse populations requires their understanding the processes that influence the health and healthcare of ethnic minorities, as well as experiences related to cultural diversity, included in medical curricula.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Entry into academic life brings about significant changes in one's life, and these changes are linked to the teaching-learning model and the student's routine. Engagement is considered the opposite of Burnout, and unlike students who suffer from academic stress, engaged students feel very connected to the activities, perceiving them as positive challenges. This research had the general objective of evaluating the Engagement Score among Health Science undergraduate students; and, the specific objectives of validating the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-S) instrument with Health Science undergraduate students; to evaluate vigor, dedication and absorption of the Engagement construct, as well as to compare scores between variables of two or more categories to obtain the Engagement Score among Health Science undergraduate students. Method: Cross-sectional analytical observational study with a quantitative approach. Results: The UWES-S was validated when applied to undergraduate students of five Health Science programs, in levels of vigor, dedication and absorption. Regarding the Dimensions Score, medicine and nursing students presented greater vigor and dedication; part-time morning class and full-time students show greater vigor and absorption; in the Absorption dimension, a higher score was observed among students up to the fourth semester of the course. As for the time dedicated to study outside university, the observed scores remained high in all three dimensions of the construct, as well as for students who practiced leisure activities. Part-time morning and full-time medical and nursing students who were married and have children, who spend much of their time studying outside university and maintain leisure activities, show a higher Engagement Score in relation to academic demands. Conclusion: Engagement is a recent construct to be applied to Brazil. Furthering our understanding of this construct enabled us to gain a new perspective of the academic setting, the students' mechanisms to adapt to higher education and the need for the teacher to be within reach as a mediator and the university to act in support of this process.",

By this essay, we recover the deeper senses of the term medicalization and discuss two interrelated assumptions: if public policies with a positive impact on the population health levels would meet a demedicalizing role and if the deepening of democracy could be considered an essential condition to face the medicalizing processes. We summarize core concepts related to the main driving forces of medicalization processes and also changes associated with increased control over nature transforming life as we know it, highlighting the advance of capitalist economic order on other spheres as the state and the community. We argue that any long-range demedicalizing perspective would depend at least two hypotheses interrelated, corresponding to the model that guides the response to health needs, and the strength of democracy in its double meaning, either as a politics category able to put the majority sectors of society at the heart of state decisions, either as an economic category able to change the economic effects of capitalism in the state-society relations.",

This median NT-proBNP in the studied groups were: 551pmol/L (Control), 302pmol/L (Group B1), 1,033pmol/L (Group B2), 954pmol/L (Group C) and 5,541pmol/L (Group D). Using an ideal cutoff of > 709pmol/L it was possible to identify dogs with true heart enlargement of those without a cardiac increase with sensitivity of 75\% and specificity of 100\%. NT-proBNP increased according to the progress of the stages of CMVD, being that stages B2, C and D, with the highest values of the biomarker. To stage B2, the NT-proBNP measurement proved to be an excellent tool for early diagnosis of cardiac enlargement in Poodles.",

When iron is unavailable for incorporation into hemoglobin, a compound called zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is formed, may be an early marker for anemia and is useful for its diagnosis. However, for this measurement to be useful, it is necessary to know the normal values for the species. Therefore, 30 calves, 30 goats and 30 sheep, all of them healthy, to standardize the values were used. This measurement was determined on refrigerated blood samples collected with EDTA, obtaining values in red blood cells not washed and washed. The washing aimed at the elimination of interfering substances in these measures. The mean of the ZPP in the unwashed samples was 80,9µmol ZPP/mol of heme in calves; 55,09µmol ZPP/mol of heme in goats and 73,76µmol ZPP/mol of heme in sheep. After washing, the values were 61,4µmol ZPP/mol of heme; 43,92µmol ZPP/mol of heme e 59,36µmol ZPP/mol of heme, in calves, goats and sheep, respectively.

Twenty-seven bitches with histopathological diagnosis of mammary neoplasia were submitted to tumor Dopplerfluxometric evaluation and collection of neoplastic fragments to analyze the gene expression of VEGF, FLT-1, FLK-1 and ATR1. Were found 22 epithelial (carcinomas) and five mesenchymal (sarcomas) tumors. Positive correlation was observed between FLT-1 and PS, PI and RI. FLK-1 presented a similar positive correlation with the PS and PI parameters, and a tendency for RI (r= 0.45, P= 0.07), whereas VEGF showed a positive correlation just with PI. VEGF also showed a positive correlation with its receptors, but did not present a correlation with ATR1. FLT-1 and FLK-1 also showed positive correlation with each other, and with ATR1. There was higher mean expression of VEGF in epithelial tumors than in mesenchymal ones. The PS, PI and RI associated with the expression of VEGF and its receptors have been shown to be relevant to characterize neovascularization of malignant tumors, and the differentiated expression of VEGF between the types of mammary tumors, may be an auxiliary indicator in the characterization of malignant breast cancers in bitches.",

Structured interviews were applied to users treated with CAM in the locations offering this option most often, using data-based theory as a theoretical-methodological reference. For the most part, the use of CAM was proposed by basic health professionals (the operators of biomedical care), initially as a preferred alternative to biomedicine. Interviewees preferred CAM, associating it to fewer side-effects. Users mentioned enhanced dialog with professionals to negotiate treatment forms. The hypothesis emerged that CAM could be the initial treatment option in a large number of cases, saving conventional treatment for subsequent use if necessary, or in some cases as the single or complementary treatment. This enables drafting an expanded flow using CAMs in primary healthcare. New studies and institutional experience are required to investigate this hypothesis, expanding the use of CAM in an ecology of institutional care.",

There was a uniform syntopy of the arch, as well as of the descending portion of the aorta in the thorax. However, the topography differs considerably. Based on the branches, regardless of gender, a greater variation was observed in those originating from the arch, and those that emerge from the thoracic aorta and irrigate medial structures and the right antimere of the thorax. Greater values were obtained for the diameter of the arteries in the female than in the males and corresponding values for the length of the thoracic aorta in both. All this variation is possibly related to the adaptive processes of Bradipodidae over time.",

Blood samples were collected from 118 chickens of the breed from five properties in three cities (Oeiras, Queimada Nova and Teresina) of Piauí state. After the DNA extraction, markers were used for twelve microsatellite loci: LEI0192, LEI0209, LEI0212, LEI0217, LEI0221, LEI0234, LEI0237, LEI0248, LEI0258, MCW0081, MCW0183, and MCW0213 that were amplified by polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR). The results showed a total of 408 alleles (adding alleles from the 12 loci) with the fragments ranging between 50 and 460 base pairs, the number of alleles ranged from 15 (MCW0081) to 52 (LEI0212) with an average of 31,5 alleles per locus. The average expected heterozygosity and PIC were, respectively, 0.887 and 0.909. Deviations were observed in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and positive values of the fixation index with excess of homozygotes. It is concluded that the used microsatellites are polymorphic and can, therefore, be used for genetic research in Canela-Preta chickens. The birds of the analyzed cores present great genetic variability, which qualifies them as an important source of genetic resources, which could be used for future animal breeding programs.",

Next, the penis divulsion and section 1.5cm caudal to the penile bone, spreading the penile urethral border and transposing it towards the abdominal cavity, making an anastomosis of simple interrupted suture to the membranous urethra. The dogs had the urethral length measured from the external meatus to the beginning of the prostatic urethra at two moments: pre-transposition and post-transposition.

Among thirty-four penguin hearts, none presented discrepancy in morphology, they were all very similar. The characterization of collagen by Picrusirius Red stain highlighted type 1 collagen in comparison to type 3 collagen in most structures, giving a more reddish appearance in almost of them. In conclusion, the cardiac anatomy of the Magellanic Penguin is similar to that of other birds, with a predominance of type I collagen.",

The uveitis score and the corneal integrity were correlated with the presence or absence of vision by contingency tables. Brachycephalic breeds accounted for 91.11\% of all cases. The number of perforated corneas [20/34 (58.82\%)] were higher than the non-perforated ones [14/34 (41.17\%)]. At post-operative day 50, the number of visual eyes with non-perforated corneas before surgery (n=13) did not differ significantly from the eyes with perforated corneas (n=12) (P = 0.05). In half of the cases, uveitis score was considered severe [17/34 (50\%)], and in the other half, mild. Eight out of 17 eyes classified with severe uveitis regained vision. In 17 eyes where uveitis score was considered mild, 16 regained vision at the end of the study. Although corneal integrity was non-correlated with the uveitis score (P = 0.48), the number of visual eyes scored with mild uveitis were significantly larger than the eyes with severe uveitis (P = 0.006). In this study, the overall success visual rate after CPG was 73,52\% \% and the corneal integrity did not play an important role regarding maintenance of vision.

The aim of this work is to report for the first time the presence of merozoites of Babesia spp. in the peritoneal fluid of a dog with ascites. At the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Viçosa was attended a Mixed-breed seven month old dog, male, with history of emaciation, apathy and abdominal bulging. Pale mucous membranes, ascites, grade IV/V systolic murmur and tachypnea were evidenced in the physical examination. Laboratory tests revealed normocytic/normochromic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoproteinemia. Intra-erythrocyte structures compatible with Babesia spp. were observed in the blood smear. The evaluation of the ascites fluid was compatible with modified transudate where numerous intra and extracellular structures compatible with Babesia spp. merozoites were observed. The presence of intra and extracellular microorganisms could be related to an injury of the spleen with extravasation of the contents into the abdominal cavity. Collection of the peritoneal fluid may be an alternative for the diagnosis of babesiosis when the animal with suspected infection has ascites.",

The proposal includes the monitoring of continuous flows between the ``forest'' and the ``city'' of the nixi pae, the so-called pajés and the emerging groups around them, evidencing ontological conflicts and connections. A significant contribution of this work may lie in feeding reflections in the ayahuasca research field from a cosmopolitical proposition (Stengers, 2007), which will seek to take nixi pae as a technology of connectivity. Thus, it is hoped to unfold the semantics of terms like cure and medicine through the pragmatics of collectives (of shamans, substances, spirits) in action: what effects do these generate when they act in network, what moves, what strengthens, what is left behind. The nixi pae will then appear as a key element in the activation of ontologically heterogeneous collectives, opening possibilities for encounters with otherness in attempts of composing spaces of coexistence.",

In this curriculum, Health Care Practice is a horizontal module with its six disciplines studied from the first to the sixth year, in various practical scenarios, but with a focus on primary health care in the Unified Health System (SUS – Sistema Único de Saúde), with learning based on practice and problem solving as central educational strategies. Objective To assess whether medical students and new graduates consider themselves prepared to work in primary health care, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their training in order to propose the adjustments required to improve the Medical course and training of graduates from the FCMS of PUC/SP. Methods A questionnaire with four open questions and five multiple choice questions using the Likert scale was answered by 66 interns and 8 new graduates. Results More than 70\% of the participants consider that they are well prepared or very well prepared to work in primary health care as general practitioners, in a person-centred, critical and reflective manner, with the skills to perform activities in health prevention, promotion and rehabilitation in accordance with the DCN and the priorities of the SUS, while valuing multiprofessional work. Participants consider as curriculum strengths: involving the student in primary health care from the beginning of the course, favouring a person-centred approach in the doctor/patient relationship, and the understanding and management of the most prevalent diseases. The weakest points reported were: little medical care was provided to patients during the course, home visits were conducted without the tutor, and Primary Health Care is undervalued in professional life. Conclusions Interns at the end of the course and new graduates from the Medical course of FCMS at PUC/SP feel themselves prepared and confident to work in primary health care as general practitioners in the SUS in the way specified in the DCN and offer critical suggestions to improve teaching/learning in this scenario.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Criterion-referenced tests measure academic performance without comparing one student to another, therefore differing from the norm-referenced tests, which are designed to determine the highest and the lowest scores. The Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde (ESCS) of Federal District, Brazil, uses criterion-referenced measurement as its only evaluative method, attempting to assess students in a more integrative way and to avoid stimulating competitiveness among students. Objective To analyze the interpretation students and teachers of Medicine and Nursery courses about this measurement. Material and Methods Cross-sectional, descriptive, quali-quantitative study, performed by application of semi-structured questionnaires to teachers and students from first to fourth year of Medicine and Nursery courses. We compared courses, students and professors using the Chi-Square test. Results and Discussion: The sample size was of 413 subjects (n = 55.9\%), composing 54 teachers and 344 students. We observed fragility in the concept of criterion-referenced measurement, as well as dissatisfaction regarding the method of evaluation adopted by the Institution (323 or 79,6\%). Most answers point subjectivity in the correction of exams and difficulties in competing for residency programs after graduation as the major problems. Other authors state that criterion-referenced measurement tends to inflate grades of students, although it also evaluates them in a more integrative way. They recommend the adoption of both measurements (criterion and norm-referenced) in order to respectively: obtain best assessment and to compare students' performances. Conclusion Comparison of academic performance is necessary for selective processes inside and outside the studied institution. Therefore, criterion-referenced measurement alone cannot meet the needs of the institution, generating problems during and after graduation. We suggest the adoption of both methods (criterion and norm-referenced measurement) as well as the application of standard setting concepts for classification of students. Evaluative instruments also need objective criteria for correction of tests, in order to provide a uniform and fairer correction. For that, we propose an increase in teacher training by adding new discussions about elaboration of tests, like Item Response Theory.",

Method It was a cross-sectional study involving at random selected students enrolled on the third, sixth and eleventh semester in three federal universities of southeastern Brazil (UFF, UFJF and Unifesp). Method Sociodemographic data were collected and the following instruments were applied: attitude evaluation scale, knowledge of scientific information scale on alcohol and management of the alcoholic patient and Audit for evaluation of alcohol problems. Results The study included 371 students. Alcohol users in the binge pattern accounted for 60.4\% (n = 223) and 113 students (30.7\%) presented a risk behavior for alcohol consumption (Audit ≥ 8). The alcohol consumption pattern did not differ between the universities nor between the evaluated periods (Kruskal Wallis, p > 0.05). Students from the three universities increased the score on the knowledge scale as the course progressed. However, there was no significant correlation between knowledge and drinking pattern (Spearman > 0.05). As for the attitude, it was observed that it is already satisfactory in the third period and improvement in the sixth period. Exception was observed among the students of Unifesp, who already presented near positive attitude in the third period that was maintained until the end of the course. Conclusion Although the university increases knowledge of risk problems of drinking this does not protect students of binge drinking. On the other hand, student's positive attitude towards alcoholic patients improves over the course, regardless of drinking and the acquired scientific knowledge.",

As a result, medical students may experience high prevalence of stress, Burnout syndrome and even depressive symptoms. Such factors can compromise the students' quality of life. All of these aspects emphasize the need of deeper studies of this population group, especially in a new context of access to higher education. The objective of this study was to evaluate the overall medical students' mental health entering the medical school, with emphasis on quality of life, Common Mental Disorders, depressive symptoms, daytime sleepiness level and Burnout, according to the gender. This is a cross-sectional study, performed with first-year undergraduate medical students from three institutions from the north of Minas Gerais. Questionnaires were applied to evaluate daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, Common Mental Disorders, Burnout and quality of life, as well as a questionnaire with sociodemographic information. Academics were approached at the college where they study, at the beginning or at the end of the class. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, and Student's t-test for independent samples, in the comparison between genders. Data from 101 incoming students were evaluated. Stress was present in 45.5\% of the students. The prevalence of depressive symptoms of varying degrees was also significant, affecting 43.6\% of the students. There was a statistically significant difference in the mental component of quality of life and in the presence of Common Mental Disorders between men and women. It was possible to observe that a significant portion had pathological levels of daytime sleepiness, symptoms of Common Mental Disorders, depressive symptoms of varying degrees, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. More than a third of the academics consider their quality of life bad when it comes to the physical and mental domain. The quality of the course and health care requires a humanized professional who seek good health, that's why it is essential that universities discuss strategies that promote health and the prevention of symptoms that compromise the mental health of academics.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Follicular lymphomas are a rare form of lymphoproliferative disorder described in veterinary medicine. Together with the probable non-existence of Hodgkin's lymphomas in dogs, this is the biggest difference about lymphoma between humans and dogs. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and anatomopathological findings observed in five dogs with follicular lymphoma. Of the five dogs with follicular lymphoma, two were male (40\%) and three were female (60\%). The age of affected dogs ranged from 11 to 13 years. Four of the five (80\%) dogs were purebred and one (20\%) had no defined breed. All dogs presented generalized lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly, which included cases as multicentric lymphoma. At necropsy, the lymph nodes and the spleen demonstrated a nodular pattern at the cut surface, characterized by tens to hundreds of white nodules of variable size, multifocal or coalescing. On the natural surface of the spleen, often (4/5, 80\%), there were myriads of white, multifocal or coalescing dots of varying sizes. In histopathology, the tumors were confirmed as follicular lymphomas. All cases were Grade III, two (40\%) included as IIIa and three (60\%) as IIIb. In one case (1/5, 20\%), follicular lymphoma was considered as a IIIb variant of small centroblasts similar to the neoplastic lymphocytes seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. Lymphomas were validated as having origin in B cells through immunohistochemistry, using anti-CD20 antibody. The cases of follicular lymphomas described behaved aggressively and led the patients to death.",

The study is based on the hypothesis that medicalization involves two meanings according to Foucault: the first related to medicine as a social practice doled out by the State to the population; and the other related to the undefined phenomenon of medicalization, i.e., the impossibility of producing practices involving the body outside of the reach of medicine. Next, medicalization is inserted in the field of contemporary biopower, which presents a new configuration based on the emergence of the notion of risk and new biotechnologies. Last, we compare the philosopher's position with that of his contemporaries, in order to historically situate him and compare and contrast his theory with the debate about medicalization in the 1970s.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Affirmative action policies adopted by University of Campinas (Unicamp) in 2005 entrance exams, added to 2014 modifications, and more recently in 2016, lead to a big profile change of University of Campinas medical students. Therefore, this paper aims to describe academics' sociodemographic profile, as well as their aspirations in choice of medical career and future specialty. The cross-sectional study included 290 undergraduate years 1, 3 and 6 (Y1, Y3 and Y6) medical students from Unicamp who answered an anonymous questionnaire applied after approval by the Institutional Review Board. Socio demographic data and factors potentially influencing decisions on medical career and specialty choices were analyzed. Data analysis showed a sample composed mostly of white (77.5\%), female (63.2\%), 20-24 years population, from the State of São Paulo (84.8\%) and interior (62.3\%). For Y1, there was statistically significant difference for `pardo' (22.6\%) – it can be translated as brown – and black (6.6\%) – there wasn't black in Y3 and Y6 – ethnic groups, public school provenience – both elementary school (42.5\%) and high school (73.6\%) –, lower maternal schooling (high school, p < 0.001) and lower family income (p < 0.001). Years 3 and 6 majority was composed of white academics (76.7\% and 90.3\%, respectively), coming from private schools (basic education and high school), with further maternal education (higher education/post-graduation) and bigger average income. The influence factors leading to choice for medical specialty modified (p < 0,001) among graduation years. Y1 students opted more frequently for `surgery/orthopedics' (37.7\%), `medical clinic/neurology' (23.6\%) and `psychiatry' (11.3\%). To Y3, the most desired specialties were `medical clinic/neurology' (40\%), `surgery/orthopedics' (13.4\%) and `obstetrician-gynecologist' (13.3\%). Amongst Y6 undergraduates, the most chosen specialties were `medical clinic/neurology' (24.5\%), `obstetrician-gynecologist' (20.2\%) and `surgery/orthopedics' (17\%). Y1 academics also revealed different aspirations regarding intended future workplace, with larger desire to practice only on SUS or on international programs. In this context, results indicate that Unicamp inclusion policy and its modifications over the years, particularly in 2016 entrance exams, have been effective in broadening access to medical education, such as greater socio demographic, economic and ethnic plurality coupled with variations in reasons for choice of medical career and specialty among graduation years analyzed.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The analysis of curricular practices has been an increasingly present activity in scientific production in the field of curriculum, mainly because in them the relations established between the knowledge, the prescribed curriculum and its accomplishment in the educational routine are aligned. In the field of medical education this analysis acquires special value, given the incipient production of works that evaluate pedagogical practices from a curricular point of view. Thus, we present the critical analysis of a curricular practice carried out in a discipline of a Medicine school, which is pertinent for presenting new looks about practice as a living expression of the curriculum in action. From the thematic content analysis about a theoretical-practical discipline we show elements that approach the integrative curricular paradigm, according to the theoretical references of Gimeno Sacristán, James Beane and Luíza Alonso. Indicators like contextualization of practice, integration of curricular areas and teacher integration are some of the elements that make up an integrated conception of curriculum, whose interdisciplinary in coherence with the central axis of curriculum development (health necessities of persons and populations identified by the health system) are pointed out in the Curricular Guidelines National for Medicine Courses as a possibility to develop meaningful and contextualized learning, focusing on the student as a subject of learning. These recommendations are of fundamental importance in the area of health, when the articulation of what one learns with the scenarios and the professional practices base (or at least must substantiate) the formation. The analysis made it possible to understand how health education can benefit from an integrated curricular organization that offers diversification and dialogue between different knowledge, relevant in the investigation and resolution of problems in the health-disease process, as well as the construction of theoretical-practical knowledge pertinent to a humanistic, critical and reflexive formation.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Programmatic student assessment is a novel educational approach aiming at optimizing the utilization of different methods for better attaining the main functions of student assessment: summative, formative and assurance of curriculum effectiveness (quality control of educational activities). Introduction of a programme for student assessment in institutions devoted to higher education in the health sciences professions isa time and resource consuming enterprise, which should be rewarded with gains in assessment quality. However, information on this is scarce. Although a few studies have yield data on various systems for work-based assessment in different health professions, the effectiveness of programmatic assessment in undergraduate settings has not been much evaluated. We therefore aimed at exploring the perceptions of selected samples of students and teachers from a single British medical school where a programmatic assessment system was recently introduced. In this case study, medical students and faculty members agreed to undergo a semi-structured, anonymously recorded interview. Audio-files were transcribed into texts, which were submitted to content analysis for identifying strengths and areas for improvement related to the current student programmatic assessment system. Our results showed that, although expressing different perspectives and criticizing a few aspects, students and teachers shared a predominant positive view on the local system for programmatic assessment. Students valued most the wealth of opportunities to receive constructive feedback from supervisors in clinical years and the multiple formative and summative objective structured exams of clinical skills. Teachers valued most the overall assessment organization and effectiveness in detecting poor performing students and praised the many training opportunities for them to be trained to play different roles in assessment. These findings allowed us to conclude that medical student and faculty experiences on a recently introduced system for programmatic assessment are predominantly positive. These results may be taken as an indication that complexity and costs associated to implementing such systems may be rewarded by improvements in student assessment overall quality.",

The insertion of the palliative care theme in the undergraduate medical curriculum offers possibilities for future physicians to face the limitations / implications that they will undergo in their professional life and even during graduation. Objective To identify the importance of the Palliative Care theme for undergraduate students in Medicine. Methodology This is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study. An adapted version of the Instrument ``PEAS – Physicians' End-of-Life Care Attitude Scale'' was used as instrument. 37 Likert-type questions were used to meet the aims of the study. The collection was made in 2015, in a random, non-probabilistic sample, composed of 134 students who were attending the last two years (internship) of Medicine School of a Brazilian Federal University. Data were analyzed in the SPSS program. Results Of the 134 participants, 59.7\% were female, aged between 22 and 37 years. The results indicate that 85.84\% of students need some supervision or basic instruction to discuss palliative care and withdrawal of treatment with patients and their families. Regarding the clinical management of the terminal patient, 78.35\% consider themselves capable of handling alone or under minimal supervision, symptoms such as constipation or vomiting, but only 19.05\% consider themselves capable of handling symptoms such as terminal delirium or dyspnea. Although 41.8\% of students do not care about their own death, 88.1\% feel anxious or uncomfortable about the death of their patient. The inclusion in the medical curriculum of communication skills in Palliative Care and end-of-life ethics was considered important or very important by 95.5\% of the students interviewed. Conclusion Data showed that the students identify the deficiencies caused by the absence or limitation of the Palliative Care teaching during graduation and are interested in seeing the theme included as a discipline in the medical curriculum, which suggests further studies on the topic.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Despite several governmental policies with the purpose of changing medical training in Brazil, it is still predominantly hospital-centered, and the learning process is focused on diseases. We conducted a study in a traditional medical school, in which the students carried out an interview focused on the illness experience assessing chronic patients with compliance difficulties in the treatment of hypertension and/or diabetes in primary care. Fourteen medical students during Family Medicine Internship at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro were trained to carry out the McGill Illness Narrative Interview (MINI) and identify the modes of understanding and attribution of meaning to the illness and treatment experience. Before and after the completion of the set of 35 interviews, the students were listened to individually regarding their understanding of the compliance phenomenon and the experience with the MINI. The 35 interviews conducted by the students were analyzed with respect to the objectives of each section, in addition to interviewer's general objective of offering a position of expertise to the patient in their report of the case. We sought to investigate the consistency of the student's experience with this script to obtain the narrative of illness using the conceptual topics – prototypes and explanatory models – and the emerging topics identified according to the technique described by Bardin for content analysis. In the analysis of the interviews conducted by the researcher with the interns at the beginning and the end of the internship, the thematic analysis consisted of two main themes: clinical understanding and experience with the non-compliance phenomenon, and the appreciation of performing the MINI in the context of medical training. The students considered the MINI a useful tool for understanding and exploring the individuals' illness and treatment experiences in their socioeconomic and cultural context. By recognizing the importance of the MINI, the interns usually reported few learning opportunities while providing care for patients. Although the students had previously recognized the importance of listening and the development of bonds, they did not know how these issues could be built, and the experience increased their confidence in the healthcare provided to patients in their medical daily life. The students noticed that non-compliance involved multiple factors, which did not usually emerge during regular medical appointments. In fact, there was more understanding about the compliance phenomenon.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The Medicine course of the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) presents an innovative curriculum, with pioneering methodological and pedagogical processes, adapted to the new National Curricular Guidelines. Of the educational modules that compose the syllabus, the Educational Professional Practice Unit (UEPP) can be highlighted. This unit symbolizes the ideals of an undergraduate training that transposes the University walls, providing apprenticeship to students in real practical settings, with teacher and student participation in public healthcare actions. The objective of the study was to analyze the care provided by the students at Family Health Centers (USF) in the context of the UEPP. The research subjects were the patients attended to by UFSCar student medics in 2014. The data was collected through individual interviews and analyzed using thematic content analysis. The analysis involved the formation of two major thematic categories: ``a caring student-patient relationship'' and ``dialogical approach to preparing the patient's medical history''. In the first category, patients highlighted the following topics: the attention and dedication afforded them as important aspects of the longitudinal care process, with a significant difference in how they perceived the service offered by the center when the students were not present; the students' accessibility and their actions in relation to the patients under their care, which resulted in the user feeling closer to the health system, as well as in an improved individual perception of self-care. One way in which the users' approval is demonstrated is in the suggestion that the academics' visiting model be adopted in other centers. In the second category, the establishment of a dialogical relationship between the student and the patients allowed for an expanded construction of the patients' medical histories, reflected in regular and accessible follow-ups. In their approach, the students carried out health promotion and prevention actions directed at each stage of the life cycle; in exchange, they were able to make use of a rich and fulfilling practical setting in order to acquire skills foreseen as part of the skillset to be taught in the first two years of undergraduate medical training. Having checked and discussed the results, the researchers ascertained that this Educational Unit provided a learning opportunity in relation to clinical care from the first years of undergraduate training onwards. Multiple possibilities for the provision of professional medical training through basic care are inferred, in addition to the positive values highlighted and derived from an ongoing care relationship between student and patient. It should also be noted that this experience allows the student medics to build interpersonal relationships within the healthcare process, serving as a foundation for their entire undergraduate and professional life, as well as a model for other institutions.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Medicine is a labor activity known for high standards of demand. The medical professional's training period includes medical residency, a step in which stressors factors can be magnified. Thus, this population could be more susceptible to the syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced professional accomplishment, known by burnout. Objective To determine the prevalence of burnout and of each of its dimensions in the population of medical residents of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and to investigate associated socio-occupational characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out with medical residents of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) conducted from December 2015 to January 2016, using a computerized instrument containing two questionnaires: one with sociodemographic variables and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI).Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS Software version 18, using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chi-square test. for correlations. Results Of the 506 HCPA medical residents', 151 participated voluntarily in the study. Burnout was present in 123 participants (81.5\%). ``Emotional exhaustion'' was the most frequent dimension (53\%), followed by ``depersonalization'' (47.7\%) and ``lack of professional achievement'' (45\%). Male gender and residents of the second year had a higher statistical possibility of developing Burnout, and the latter, also presented lower professional achievement and greater depersonalization. Fourth-year residents were less associated with depersonalization and burnout overall. Residents of surgical specialties were less associated with emotional exhaustion. Studying psychiatry was shown to be a protective factor for depersonalization, while radiology presented a risk to this dimension. Conclusion The high prevalence of burnout among medical residents especially among those attending the second year, raises concern, since it can lead to the risk of developing depression, to professional abandonment, to a decrease in the quality of care provided to patients. Thus, preventive measures against its development associated to the early diagnosis and adequate clinical management are fundamental for the reduction of its prevalence.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT From the context of the end of the military regime and the consequent democratization of the country, with the accomplishment of the VIII National Conference of Health and the creation of the Unified Health System (SUS), proposals for changes to medical education begin to emerge in order to adapt it to this new system. Within this process, the formation of the National Interinstitutional Commission for the Evaluation of Medical Education (Cinaem) was highlighted in 1991, with the proposal to carry out a self-assessment of medical education at that time in different phases, which culminated in 2001, with the elaboration of the National Curricular Guidelines (DCN) for the medical education. Understanding that the medical education proposed by the DCN aims to train professionals with a generalist, humanist, critical and reflective profile, which contemplate the current health system, and whose formation must take place through the link with the social needs of health, with emphasis on SUS, this work aimed to identify, through a qualitative analysis, the influence exerted by the medical education in a teaching institution on the perceptions of its students and excipients about the Unified Health System. Data were collected from focus groups, carried out with students from the third to the twelfth medical period, following a flexible guiding script. The cross-sectional and horizontal reading of data based on Donabedian's 24 ``Structure, Process and Results'' methodology allowed the identification of central themes present in the narratives, on which the discussion was built. Among them, the following themes were highlighted: faculty, theoretical and practical adequacy and public health. Finally, the students' vision about the SUS system, their intentions of utilization and professional insertion in it, and some evidence of a hidden curriculum were understood. The study brought to the conclusion that medical training has a strong influence on these factors. Most of the students do not have the interest of working in the SUS nor of its use, motivated by practical experiences, by the discourse and example of the teachers.",

In his thesis, Arouca sought to understand how the rules of discursive formation of preventive medicine and relations with non-discursive instances were produced, studying the articulations with the capitalist mode of production. The analysis of these articulations enabled Arouca to evidence that preventive medicine did not escape the fundamental contradiction of medicine that transforms health - a use-value into exchange-value through medical care. Therefore, the research that is done by rescuing that category is directed to a specific question: how did the update of the discourse of preventive medicine for health promotion happened? The category coined by Arouca has made it possible to highlight that health promotion does not escape the fundamental contradiction of medicine, and, instead of being an innovation for the field of health, it is an update of the preventivist discourse, setting, thus, the promotionist dilemma.",

A second order model was found, where health perception is defined around two factors - current health (seven items) and previous health (two items). The experience of serious or significant illness, as well as well-being and health, are assumed as key elements in the individual construction of the previous and current health perception respectively.",

Its growth, offer and, use justify the need to build more complex and more appropriate methodological frameworks to explicit the uniqueness of this approach to healthcare and the diversity of its techniques. Based on a narrative review of the recent literature, this article aims to contribute to the construction of an evaluation model, focused on understanding the uniqueness and diverse dimensions of this specific care, seeking to reflect on the challenges and evidences of successful therapy. The proposed model is based on qualitative healthcare approaches, in which the experiences of the involved agents (professionals and users) in the therapeutic process become central. Assessing their effectiveness means recognizing the interconnected processes and their multiple dimensions: host practices, dialogue, diagnosis, action, and outcomes achieved.",

 abstract = "Abstract Background Macintosh laryngoscopes are widely used for endotracheal intubation training of medical students and paramedics whereas there are studies in the literature that supports videolaryngoscopes are superior in endotracheal intubation training. Our aim is to compare the endotracheal intubation time and success rates of videolaryngoscopes and Macintosh laryngoscopes during endotracheal intubation training and to determine the endotracheal intubation performance of the students when they have to use an endotracheal intubation device other than they have used during their education. Methods Endotracheal intubation was performed on a human manikin owing a standard respiratory tract by Macintosh laryngoscopes and C-MAC® videolaryngoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttligen, Germany). Eighty paramedic students were randomly allocated to four groups. At the first week of the study 10 endotracheal intubation trials were performed where, Group-MM and Group-MV used Macintosh laryngoscopes; Group-VV and Group-VM used videolaryngoscopes. Four weeks later all groups performed another 10 endotracheal intubation trial where Macintosh laryngoscopes was used in Group-MM and Group-VM and videolaryngoscopes used in Group-VV and Group-MV. Results Success rates increased in the last 10 endotracheal intubation attempt in groups MM, VV and MV (p = 0.011; p = 0.021, p = 0.290 respectively) whereas a decrease was observed in group-VM (p = 0.008). Conclusions The success rate of endotracheal intubation decreases in paramedic students who used VL during endotracheal intubation education and had to use Macintosh laryngoscopes later. Therefore we believe that solely videolaryngoscopes is not enough in endotracheal intubation training programs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Periodontal disease (PD) is the most common inflammatory disease of the oral cavity of dogs. Quantitation of plasma and salivary biomarkers have been used to assess the systemic oxidative stress (SOS) and local (LOS) of human PD. In canine PD, oxidative stress mechanisms are not well characterized and established. Our objective was to investigate the hypothesis that SOS occurs in dog PD and saliva can be used to evaluate the LOS. We also investigated the hypothesis that the activation of neutrophil oxidative metabolism contributes to SOS in dog SD. For this purpose, 20 adult dogs were selected PD patients, grouped according to the degree of injury: gingivitis (n=6), light periodontitis (n=8) and advanced periodontitis (n=6). The control group was composed of the same 20 dogs, 30 days after periodontal treatment. To assess oxidative metabolism of circulating neutrophils superoxide production was measured by test nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NBT). The total oxidant concentrations (TOC) and reactive species to tiobartbitúrico acid (TBARS) in plasma were quantified to evaluate SOS. For the evaluation of local oxidative stress were quantified salivary TOC and concentration of the main antioxidant in saliva (albumin, uric acid, and total bilirubin). EOS in dogs with PD was confirmed by increased superoxide production of circulating neutrophils, TOC, and plasma TBARS. It was possible to quantify all the biomarkers in the saliva of dogs, but none was able to express the LOS canine PD. This is the first evidence that SOS occurs in dogs with PD and that activation of the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils may contribute to an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. This study highlights the importance of oral hygiene of dogs to prevent PD and chronic degenerative lesions of various tissues caused by SOS.",

Analysis was performed on 125,191 records of daily production of 9,242 cows using repeatability model (MREP) and MAR. On MREP, a long-term environment was considered, on MAR, the short-term environment was also taken into consideration. The models were compared by logarithm of the maximum likelihood function ( − 2 log L ). The heritability estimated using the MREP model was 0.18, while the heritability estimated by MAR for first, second, and third lactations were 0.32, 0.28 and 0.26, respectively. The autocorrelation estimates of the components of long-term variance were close to zero, and those of the short-term were of high magnitude for first (0.79), second (0.79) and third (0.81) lactations. Therefore, the influence of the short-term environment within each lactation is not the same. The value of − 2 log L closer to zero was obtained for MAR (-294,884.7778) in relation to MREP (-329,266.4810). Thus, MAR is suitable for obtaining genetic parameters estimates for PLDC in the first three lactations of dairy cattle.",

The genus Amblyomma presents the greatest medical importance, with the species Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888 involved in the transmission cycle of Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF). In this study, we performed a molecular validation of the morphometric differentiation based on the idiosomal length of the larvae of A. dubitatum and A. sculptum. Unfed larvae were collected in two BSF-transmission areas, using the attractive CO2 trap technique. Larvae were identified at the species level by comparative morphometry, molecular analysis by PCR and genomic sequencing, with validation through agreement analysis by the Kappa test. The larvae of A. dubitatum showed a significantly longer idiosomal length than A. sculptum larvae. Although no other species of the genus Amblyomma has been tested in this study, this technique can be applied to places where previous acarological surveillances based on adult and nymphal ticks stages have indicated the presence of only A. sculptum and A. dubitatum, usually sustained by capybaras. Noteworthy, this condition is very common among many BSF-endemic areas in southeastern Brazil.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the depth of the udder on cleaning of teats and health of the mammary gland. The experiment was developed in the period spanning from March to June 2014, in Castro, PR. Twenty Holstein cows confined in free stall and milked in an automatic milking system (AMS) were used. The cows were divided into 4 groups with five animals (2 primiparous and 3 multiparous) based on the depth of the udder (udder depth: normal, small, and shallow). The electronically recorded data were collected monthly for four months, referring to the week of the official production milk control. To evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning teats, two contralateral teats were swabbed (right front quarter and left rear) before and after the automatic cleaning and once moistened towels were scrubbed around the other teats. A sample of milk was collected per cow to determine the somatic cell count (SCC). In the multivariate analysis relation of the udder depth with the teat cleaning was observed and evaluated through the teat cleaning with moistened towels score (TCTS). Udders slightly above the hocks (normal) had lower SCC and total bacterial count (TBC) of the teats. Shallow udders showed greater difference in TCTS. Cows with deep and shallow udders show less effective teat cleaning and health of the mammary gland. Cows with normal udders presented mammary gland conformation and health and contamination of teats most appropriate for robotic milking. On farms intending to introduce AMS it is recommended to select cows with udder depth which is a little above the hock. The impact of AMS on the TBC of the teats is related to the condition of cleaning of the teats pre-milking and housing conditions. Therefore, the condition of ambience of the cows is fundamental for the health of the mammary gland and obtaining high quality milk.",

Bivariate associations were assessed using the Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact test for variables. Despite 65.6\% of respondents being aware of the existence of the PNPIC, the presence of herbal medicines on the National List of Medicines was unknown by 85.4\%. The majority (96.2\%) of the professionals believe in the therapeutic effects of medicinal plants but do not prescribe this medicine. However, 98.7\% agreed with the initiative to offer this complementary and integrative practice through SUS after training in the area.",

Adelina became known for producing more than 17,500 works, including paintings and sculptures.

The clinical case report of the patient, as analyzed by her therapist, is used to explore the way in which issues of gender and sexuality were imprinted in psychiatric institutions and medical-psychological knowledges during the twentieth century, with special reference to the analytical psychology of C. G. Jung and its appropriation by Nise da Silveira.

Survival was reduced in all treatments, probably influenced by the disease of the White Spot and the high salinity of the water of the nurseries, causing reduction in the production and raising the Apparent Food Conversion Factor-FCAA in M1 and M2. The Profitability and Profitability Indices were significantly lower in the M1 treatment when compared to M2 and M3. The cultivation with high initial population (M1) caused economic and zootechnical losses due to high FCAAs, reduced individual biomass and high total operational costs-TOC, making this treatment unfeasible. The internal rates of return for M2 and M3 were attractive, generating profit and a positive balance for the net present value. Monoculture of shrimp with small populations and submitted to Mancha Branca (M2 and M3), managed to guarantee the return of invested capital.

The yield was evaluated as simple yield (liters of milk/kg of cheese produced) and dry yield (liters of milk/kg of total solids of cheese produced). The cheese-making efficiency was evaluated by the loss of solids in cheese whey. Multivariate analysis showed a relationship between high SCC and decrease in simple and dry colonial cheese yield, which also had lower manufacturing efficiency, without altering the composition of the cheese. Moreover, data on the physical and chemical characteristics of colonial cheese were determined, that does not have Technical Regulation of Identity and Quality. We conclude that the quality of milk has a direct influence on the production of cheeses and, when using raw materials with high SCC, the industry takes the costs of worsening in performance and manufacturing efficiency in colonial cheese.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Idiopathic head tremor is a form of paroxysmal dyskinesia recognized as hereditary or associated with certain races, being reported in English bulldogs, doberman pinschers, and boxers. Also known as head bobbing or episodic head tremor, the affected dogs present with seizures characterized by tremors limited to head region, horizontal direction, vertical or both and are usually related to a triggering event. Two dogs of the English bulldog breed (a male of 1 year and a female of 7 months) with a history of episodic tremors restricted to the head region were seen at the UFMS Veterinary Hospital. Complete physical and neurological examinations were performed, and no alterations were found. Based on race, history, absence of other clinical signs and exclusion of other causes of tremors, the diagnosis of head bobbing was performed. Such a disease is characterized by tremors restricted to the head region, associated with a benign genetic condition. It is not considered a form of seizure, since the animal remains alert and responsive to environmental stimuli, the tremors can be interrupted by distractions or any interaction with the environment, being not responsive to anticonvulsant therapy. According to the literature review, these are the first cases diagnosed and reported in Brazil.",

In surgical exploration were identified two cases of jejunum and ileum entrapped, one of the ileum and one of jejunum. All animals showed EFE from left to right. The horse that had trapped the ileum has survived. The others were euthanized due to the extent of injury or rupture of large vessels during surgical reduction. Although there are many notes of possible risk factors for EFE occurrence, cribbing is the risk factor that has the highest positive correlation with EFE. This appointment was confirmed by the cases presented.

The 96-h LC50 were 22.48, 53.62, and 74.14µg/mL for MV, SV, and PV, respectively. Mortality of 100\% was observed at the concentrations of 400-1000μg/mL of the three compounds. The teratogenic effects most observed (P<0.05) were pericardial and yolk sac edemas. Adult animals exposed to the vanadium compounds had higher opercular beats and congestion in the gill arches. The exhibition of behaviors Floating and Resting in the exposed adults was significant (P<0.05), as well as the Air breathing behavior. Chemical exposure to vanadium compounds caused toxic effects in embryos and adults of zebrafish with high mortality. In conclusion, its use as a potential antidiabetic drug should be better studied due to the toxic effect.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical education has been leading important transformations in the initial decades of the 21st century in Brazil, seeking to redirect the training offered, in order to meet the principles and guidelines of the Sistema Único de Saúde [Unified Health System] – the universal national health system of Brazil. The main goal of this study is to investigate comprehensiveness as a guiding axis of graduate-level medical teaching in Brazil, seeking to contribute to discussions on the subject. This is a literature review, inspired by the state of the question approach, which proposes to conduct a targeted bibliographic mapping in order to identify, enhance and highlight the specificity and relevance of the research object. The research was carried out in the second half of 2017, on the databases SciELO and Lilacs, using the search terms ``Medical education'' and ``Comprehensiveness in Health''. As inclusion criteria, only scientific articles published in the period 2007 to 2017 were selected. Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, five articles were selected to compose the research data. The analysis and interpretation was based on the analysis of thematic content, resulting in three categories: polysemy and integrality polyphony, contribution of the notion of competence to comprehensiveness, and comprehensiveness as a permanent goal of care and teaching. The results indicate that medical students have difficulty conceptualizing comprehensiveness in its broader sense, limiting their understanding to the sense of ``comprehensive care''; teachers also find it difficult to work comprehensively in their teaching. However, in courses with competency-oriented curricula, as recommended by the National Curricular Guidelines for the medical course, comprehensiveness is more prevalent in the theory-practice relationship; Finally, comprehensiveness is seen by the authors as a permanent search to guide the medical training since graduation. These results demonstrate that there is interest and concern in training medical professionals to meet the health needs of individuals and populations, based on a comprehensive, theoretical and practical understanding of comprehensiveness.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of role-playing in addressing the issue of conscientious objection in the medical curriculum. METHODS This is an intervention study involving 120 medical students on completion of their internship in Perinatology.The project consisted of eight modules with 15 students in each. Initially a questionnaire was applied to obtain the students' demographic information, religion, ethical knowledge of conscientious objection in medical practice, whether or not the students agreed with it, and the level of comfort in addressing situations such as legal abortion, the prescription of emergency contraceptives, and giving advice on contraception to young adolescents. Subsequently, three short films, created exclusively for the project, were shown. The first addressed a doctor's refusal to perform an abortion on a 15-year-old girl who had been the victim of sexual violence. The second simulatedes a doctor's objection to providing advice on contraception to a 13-year-old adolescent without parental consent, and the third portrayed the doctor's refusal to prescribe emergency contraception to a young woman after having unprotected intercourse on the 14th day of her cycle. A discussion was then instigated on the following topics: the existing legislation on the subject, the doctor's right to conscientious objection, violation of the patient's autonomy, and the potential for discrimination and harm to the patient's health due to the doctor's refusal. Subgroups of three students were then formed, to simulate clinical cases, with the students taking turns to play the roles of the physician, patient and observer. At the end, the questionnaire was reapplied. The data were analyzed by the χ2 test, t-test and McNemar's test, with a level of significance of 5\%. RESULTS Abortion was rejected by 35.8\% of the students, contraception for adolescents by 17.5\%, and emergency contraception by 5.8\%. The predictors identified with legal abortion were stronger religious belief (p < 0.001) and more frequent attendance of religious services (p = 0.034). The refusal to provide contraception to adolescents was significantly higher among women (p = 0.037).Of the sample, 25\% did not explain the reason for their refusal, 15\% did not describe all procedures, and 25\% said they would not forward patients. The change in comfort in conducting legal abortion after the intervention was significant (p < 0.001). The same was observed in the attitude to providing contraceptives to young adolescents (p < 0.001) and in the prescription of emergency contraception (p = 0.002). The change of opinion regarding objection to legal abortion was significant (p = 0.003), as was the attitude to providing and also regarding the contraceptives to young adolescents (p = 0.012). No differences were observed in the prescription of emergency contraception (p = 0.500). CONCLUSIONS The application of this methodology in the participant group made the students more comfortable about conducting cases like those discussed, and provided technical, legal and ethical content for a better grounding of their opinions.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The health of the population deprived of liberty has unusual aspects, due to the high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, dermatological injuries, and mental disorders aggravated by the overcrowding and precarious conditions in the penitentiary units. The health care offered is of poor quality, based on resolving specific complaints, but with difficulty accessing other health services. Integration between teaching and service is one of the guidelines for medical courses, which have the role of training critical and reflective physicians who are aware of the social needs. It was out of this approach of the university to the prison system that the discipline of Confinement Medicine emerged, in 2011, at the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo. The present report describes the process of conception and formation of the discipline and its theoretical-practical structure, and offers a reflection on the learning and its particular characteristics in confinement. This optional discipline has 30 hours and is offered twice a year, with places for forty students per year. Up until 2016, 188 medical students took this discipline. Besides the academic program, the discipline also includes practical activities, carried out in penitentiaries in the region of Ribeirão Preto. The different realities experienced by the undergraduate students in the university and penitentiary scenarios enables them to reflect on the importance of integrating these two worlds that, when in contact, contribute both to the qualification of the medical care provided and to students' sense of responsibility as citizens, and their role as professionals. The discipline helps strengthen ties between society and marginalized populations, promoting the resocialization of people deprived of liberty. It also prompts reflections about the dimensions of illness, and their influence on the life context of these patients, enabling us to reflect on how the construction of a proper project based on these social realities can guarantee the principles of universality, equity and integrally of care.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Teaching methodologies in higher education have evolved in recent years, increasingly emphasizing the learner's role in the teaching-learning process, and the construction of their own knowledge and that of their peers. However, the training structure that exists in the majority of medical education courses still lack innovations in their pedagogical practices that will allow meaningful learning experiences that stimulated dialog-based learning and student interaction. One of the proposals that has been promoted as an alternative for improving medical education is Team Based Learning (TBL), which favors dynamic learning through group discussions, in a motivating, cooperative and supportive environment. In this context, this article aims to describe, through a report of an experiment, the planning, implementation and development of contents on the conception and formation of the human being and reproductive health, using TBL as a teaching methodology on a medical course of the expansion of the Program Mais Médicos [More Doctors Program] in the interior of the Northeast of Brazil. Initially, the students received study scripts on the contents to be developed in the classroom, and performed prior study of the activities to be developed. In the classroom, they took a test, individually. Afterwards, divided into small groups, they debated each of the questions and the answers that they had selected, before coming together to form a consensus, to present a single answer, as a group. TBL was found to be very useful in the learning process, and in the evaluation of the students' training. The students' exercised skills in communication, argumentation and persuasion, improved their interaction between peers and with the faculty members, and enhanced their personal performance. It is believed that TBL offers a more articulated way of gaining the knowledge needed to respond to the health demands and needs of the population, and helping to transform the local conditions of life and health.",

This study therefore evaluates quality of life in students from the 1st to 4th year of medical school at the Universidade Federal de São Carlos. The complete version WHOQoL-100 questionnaire was used as the data collection instrument, translated and validated for Portuguese. This questionnaire evaluates six domains, in addition to global QoL. All 182 students enrolled from the 1st to 4th year were interviewed. Four students were excluded from the sample due to incomplete filling out of the questionnaire, resulting in five groups: a control group with 32 students recently admitted to medical college; 1st year group with 38 students who had just completed the 1st year; a 2nd year group with 35 students who had just completed the 2nd year; a 3rd year group with 35 students who had just completed the 3rd year; and a 4th year group with 38 students who had just completed the 4th year. Descriptive analysis of the results was presented as means ± SEM. The significance of the differences was determined by analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. For the correlation analysis, the Spearman correlation method was used. The level of significance was set at 5\%. Global QoL showed a better score in the control group (77.54 ± 2.153) followed, in descending order, by the 2nd year (65.71 ± 3.923), 4th year (65.63 ± 3.306), 1st year (65.46 ± 3.289) and 3rd year (52.86 ± 2.766). There was a significant difference in the Global QoL for the 3rd year group in relation to the others (p <0.05). Among all the evaluated domains, the psychological domain had a significant influence on QoL, presenting strong correlation in the 1st to the 4th year groups.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Recent studies showed that emotional intelligence (EI) could improve medical education and professional practice. There were no instruments validated for Brazilian Portuguese to evaluate EI level. OBJECTIVE To translate and cross-culturally adapt the Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) for Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS The translation and cross-cultural adaptation was performed in six steps: translation, synthesis, back translation, expert committee review, pretesting and elaboration of the final version. A Brazilian psychologist and an English Teacher, both fluent in English, performed the translations from English to Portuguese. Two native English speakers who were not familiar with the questionnaire performed the back translations. The authors composed the expert committee review. The internal consistency and reliability of the final version was tested by Cronbach's alpha (Ca). Values of ≥ 0.70 were considered acceptable. The pretesting was done with medical students and resident doctors, who answered the test and rewrote the sentences in their own words. RESULTS The Portuguese SSEIT translated version had 100\% semantic and idiomatic equivalence. The comparison between the back translated versions and the original showed slight semantic discrepancies in four questions, therefore the texts were adjusted. The pretesting version was applied to 41 volunteers, after signing an Informed Consent Form. Seven questionnaires were eliminated as they were not filled out properly. Analyses of the rewritten sentences showed slight discrepancies in the same four questions of the back translations, and were again adjusted. The Ca was 0.786 for the whole questionnaire and ranged from 0.763 to 0.798 between the questions. CONCLUSION The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the SSEIT for Brazilian Portuguese was a success, and showed acceptable internal consistency and reliability according to Cronbach's alpha test.",

OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence and the factors associated with depression and anxiety among university students in the field of health. METHODS A transversal, analytical study involving students in the first year of a degree in health (biomedicine, nursing, physiotherapy, medicine and odontology) at a University Center in Ceará. Three questionnaires were applied. The first involved sociodemographic aspects, the second was the Beck Depression Inventory – BDI, and the third was the Beck Anxiety Inventory – BAI (both adapted and standardized for Brazil). The data were digitalized using the software Epi-info version 3.5.1, and analyzed in Stata 11.2. Bivariate analysis was performed for the associations between the variables by means of the Prevalence Ratio (PR), as well as their respective intervals of confidence, with a level of significance of p < 0.05. The project was approved by the REC, with CAAE number 1.132.140, of June 30, 2015. RESULTS 476 students answered the questionnaires. The female sex was prevalent (71.6\%), with the majority of students under 20 years of age (69.3\%), and single (92.0\%). The prevalence rates for depression and anxiety were 28.6\% and 36.1\%, respectively. Students who were less satisfied with the course had a four times higher likelihood of having depression (p < 0.001). Risk factors were highlighted, such as unsatisfactory family relationships (p < 0.001), lack of sleep (p=0.006), and unsatisfactory relationships with friends (p < 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety was more closely associated with the female sex (p < 0.001), and with unsatisfactory relationships with family members (p < 0.001), friends (p = 0.005) and colleagues (p < 0.001). Having insomnia (p < 0.001), not doing much physical activity (p = 0.040), and a higher concern about the future (p = 0.002) also presented significant association with anxiety status. CONCLUSION The significant prevalence of anxiety and depression among students in the field of health were much higher than among the general population, with physiotherapy students having the highest result.",

This article reports on an experience of integration between medical students and a Family Health Strategy (FHS) team, carried out based on the analysis and discussion of users' clinical pathways. The clinical pathways were designed based on Home Visits (HV) to families who had been followed up by the students. These clinical pathways were then discussed with the professionals of the FHS. The pathways evidenced a worsening of chronic diseases, the use of a mixture of public and private health services, and the search for care only when symptoms appear. The health team confirmed the difficulties reported by the users in relation to specialized care, access to surgical procedures, and the performance of some diagnostic tests. On the other hand, the professionals also reported care that is not known to the users, such as obtaining medical consultations in the FHS and the care given by the nursing team. It was observed that many users perceive Primary Care (PC) as an extension of Emergency Care, and do not understand level-of-care assignments. This situation, together with the difficulty of the team in promoting health and home visits, contributes to the frustration of the FHS workers. This analysis enabled the students to identify the difficulties of users in accessing health, and the difficulties of the FHS team in promoting comprehensiveness of healthcare. In addition, there was a certain distance between public policies and work processes, despite the health workers' efforts to meet the needs of users, also showing failures in health care management and network. The importance of this method for inter-professional training in health was apparent, as it promotes an analysis of situations encountered in the daily life of the health team.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This article is based on a dissertation written by the author, for the Master's degree course in Health Teaching of the Universidade José do Rosário Vellano (Unifenas). The title of the work is: ``Actions to bring back humanized education in medical schools: a systematic review of the literature, 2010-2016''. The article presents the results of a systematic literature review on the subject of making medical schools more humanized. The dehumanization of medicine has been largely attributed to medical schools, which have focused on scientific aspects to the detriment of theoretical topics, and those geared towards humanism. Medical schools have been impelled to revise their curricula, reinstating neglected disciplines and implementing ways of bring humanism back into medical practice. The general objective of this dissertation was to identify the actions proposed or developed by courses of medicine to bring humanization back into medical practice. The specific objectives were to identify the main attributes of humanism, and to describe the main educational interventions adopted for the development of the humanism in medical practice. To achieve these objectives, a systematic literature review was carried out on the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and PubMed databases, from 2010 to 2016, searching on articles in Portuguese and English. The searches resulted in the selection of 23 publications. The results showed that the main attribute of humanism is the empathy; that the main actions implemented by the medical schools are changes to the course curricula; and that the main educational actions implemented are changes to the curricula, exchange programs, and community outreach programs, through the inclusion of new disciplines, use of play activities, and opportunities to learn in cultural contexts different from those of the students' origin. The work concludes that the range of measure adopted is still small, considering the large number of medical courses, and that the results of these actions require more objective analysis.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The motivational case, also called a problem situation or case study, is a student-focused learning method that involves problem solving, with the aim of assessing students' prior knowledge about a presented situation and identifying the learning needs, building new meaning and knowledge, and developing specific self-learning skills. Strategically, it involves the inclusion of social materials (text, audio, printed documents, videos) in the course for analysis and discussion, in order to provide a background context for the theoretical content being taught. It is a very useful tool for teaching basic and preclinical subjects in health care, leading the student through day-to-day situations that they will encounter in their future professional careers. The students' processes of reflection and discussion of the motivational cases enable a contrast to be made between common sense and academic judgment, which creates motivational movement through the flow of practice and reality to the theoretical content being taught, and the opportunity to generate dilemmas, opinions, comparisons and controversies during the work, mediated by the teacher. Thus, it allows future skills and abilities to be discussed and anticipated, as well as providing new theoretical and practical dimensions, sometimes unforeseen. It is, therefore, an opportunity for the student to create the perspective of practice, while the theoretical content of the subject is being learned. It is a more versatile investigative methodology than PBL (Problem Based Learning) as it can be inserted within a traditional course (Lecture Based Teaching) and is not necessarily the sole teaching strategy. Our aim in this work is to report our experience of the construction, implementation and assessment of two motivational cases designed for fourth year students of the theoretical Oncology course of Botucatu Medical School (Unesp). The motivational cases were built from news media and applied to a class of twenty-seven students, divided into two groups. The first discussion session took place at the start of the course and the second session took place at the end of the course, when the students presented their final work in the form of a seminar. The motivational cases were concluded at the end of the course, through a participatory class on ``Cancer Prognosis'', a theme that was common to the two motivational cases. Based on this experience, we conclude that the use of the motivational case as a pedagogical tool gives students a better understanding of the social reality, enabling them to build knowledge networks, and turning them into active subjects of the learning process, without sacrificing the depth and specificity that medical students need to develop.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The way of thinking about medicine courses, and the profile of future physicians in Brazil have changed since 2001, and this has affected the institutions and people involved in this process. This article analyzes medical students' views on what is expected of them after graduation, and the new concept of physician expected by the public health care system in Brazil. It is a qualitative study, based on portfolios developed by students in their final period in the years 2013 and 2014. Analysis of the portfolios considered the expectations generated by the students' expectations of medical schools in Brazil since 2001, i.e., to produce general physicians with a humanistic, critical, reflective and ethical training. The results revealed that most students think about the public health system, and know and understand how it is organized, but they do not identify themselves either with the scenario, or with the professionals who work within it. Regarding their role as students in this context, some students adopted the position of spectators, while others recognized how important they are in helping to change the system in line with SUS guidelines. Finally, the students believe that the ESF may work, but they do not feel part of this system and do not recognize the patients they meet there as their idealized patient.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION In order to acquire the medical skills recommended by the National Curricular Guidelines, academic institutions in the area of heath have looked for new strategies. In this context, it is seen that cooperative learning, when stimulated in the framework of active teaching-learning methodologies, can bring important advantages for medical training. The general objective of this study was to explore students' and teachers' views on cooperative learning in a medical curriculum based on active methods (Problem Based-Learning and Investigation). The specific objectives were: to investigate the benefits of cooperation in small groups of students, and to identify the needs for teachers to adapt their practices when working with these small groups. METHODS This is a descriptive, quantitative and qualitative study, with the application of questionnaires and semi structured interviews to students in the first to fourth years of medical school, and teachers participating in tutorials and pedagogical cycles. The data from the questionnaires were arranged in tables and evaluated through a Likert scale. The interviews were recorded and transcribed for subsequent grouping of cores of meaning for content analysis, thematic modality. The research was supported by Pibic/CNP, with process number 115007/2016-4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Regarding the student's profile, the majority were aged between 22 and 25 years, female, and White. Regarding the teachers' profile, 85\% had graduated by the traditional method, with 16 to 30 years since graduating,15 to 21 years of working with active methods, and 92\% with postgraduate degrees. The quantitative and qualitative results were convergent; the students and teachers presented analogous conceptions about the benefits ofcooperative learning in small groups, believing that communication skills, critical thinking, positive interdependence, advance toward teamwork, and the acquisition of cognitive knowledge are guaranteed in this process. It was also observed that as the students moved up through the grades, their views changed slightly in relation to several questions. This may be realted to the extra maturity that comes with the passage of years, but it is largely due to the experience withactive methods. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS Cooperative learning is efficient within small groups. It brings social, cognitive and psychomotor benefits, and it is favored in the area of active methodologies with lifelong learning. The results of this study could be useful for providing guidance to managers and coordinators of other medical courses seeking to use active methodologies, or even for those that already use them.",

The conception of determination and determinants and the historicity of these theoretical models transcend the academic realm, once we consider the particularity involving public health, collective health, and social medicine, in which science and politics have a close relationship. Through the description of the differences between these two terms, our aim in this essay was to bring back, in theory, the elaboration of the social determination of health, highlighting its relationship with the knowledge produced in Latin America and its repercussions in Brazil, as well as the influences of the scientific and epistemological paradigms, the set of theories, and the projects that are in dispute in this field. In order to encompass the academic and political dimensions contained in the theoretical models, we sought the help of authors that move among different fields of knowledge. Without the intention of covering all of the points of observation that our incursion provided, we present a summary of our conception of the theoretical model of the social determinants of health and, chiefly, of the social determination of health, which we suggest should be divided into two categories, structural determination and structural-relational determination, in order to enable a better observation of the theoretical and methodological improvements, by emphasizing complexity epistemologically.",

The main objective was to establish a comparative analysis of the quality and viability characteristics of the new lipofragmentation technique and those of the well-known liposuction technique, widely accepted as a viable source of fat grafting. In vivo and in vitro assays were designed to evaluate the biological behavior of the samples to guide new and possible human studies with clinical applications. Methods: A post-bariatric patient who underwent abdominal dermolipectomy had her surgical specimen resected, which was divided into four parts that underwent liposuction and lipofragmentation, with and without prior infiltration. All samples were centrifuged and distributed for assays with assessments involving histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cell culture, and xenograft injection on the back of 10 Wistar rats, which was evaluated after six weeks for mass, volume, and histological features. Results: The structural characteristics and biological behaviors of fragmented, dry, and infiltrated fat samples were similar to those of liposuction samples. Conclusions: Fat fragmentation transformed the subcutaneous cellular tissue of dermolipectomies into a new, viable injectable lipograft variant, with biological characteristics similar to those of traditional liposuction. Although still preliminary, our results support further investigations to optimize the technique and improve fat grafting and its possible applications in regenerative medicine.",

The objective is to evaluate the evolution of the quality of RCTs published by plastic surgeons in the subsequent five-year period, from 2009 to 2013. Methods: RCTs published from 2009 to 2013, in English, with the participation of at least one plastic surgeon, were identified by an electronic search and classified according to allocation concealment by two independent evaluators. The quality of the studies with adequate allocation concealment was evaluated by two evaluators using the Delphi List and the Jadad Scale. Results: Of the 6,997 identified studies, 261 were classified according to allocation concealment. Of these, 43 (16.47\%) had adequate allocation concealment. According to an assessment conducted using the Delphi List, there was an improvement in the items ``most important characteristics of the prognosis'' (p < 0.001), ``use of an independent evaluator'' (p = 0.0029), and ``measures of variability and estimation of points for the primary variable'' (p = 0.0057) compared to the 1966-2003 assessment ; there was no difference in the assessment of the same items from 2004-2008. Regarding the Jadad Scale, there was an increase in the scores from 2009 to 2013 compared to the 1996-2003 period (p < 0.0004); however, there was no significant difference in the 2004-2008 period. Conclusion: There was no difference in the quality of the RCTs published by plastic surgeons in the 2009-2013 period compared to the previous five-year period (2004 to 2008). However, both periods indicated higher quality compared to the 1966-2003 period.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Nile tilapia skin (Oreochromis niloticus) as an occlusive biological dressing in the management and treatment of second-degree burns in adults. Methods: This clinical study included 30 patients randomly treated with Nile tilapia skin (n = 15) or Aquacel Ag® silver-based hydrofiber dressing (n = 15). Results: The Nile tilapia skin yielded a similar mean treatment time (9.6 ± 2.4 days) to thatof the comparative material (10.7 ± 4.5 days). There was no statistically significantintergroup difference (p > 0.68) in pain during dressing changes. No disadvantage in pain wasnoted, as 66.7\% of patients treated with Nile Tilapia skin reported a decrease in pain events Moreover, 60\% of the patients treated with the Nile Tilapia skin did not require dressing replacement at any time during treatment. For the Aquacel AG® dressing, 53.3\% of the patients required more than one dressing replacement. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the Nile tilapia skin is as effective as an occlusive biological dressing. The average treatment time (complete wound healing) and pain reports during dressing changes were similar between groups. Furthermore, pain after and number of dressing exchanges (when performed) were not worse.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Contemporary medical education prioritizes the development of scientific knowledge and technical skills, associated with professional attitudes. Attitudes are components of affective ability and influence medical practice, so they should be taught systematically during undergraduate training. The use of films as a pedagogical resource in medical training allows reflection on the biopsychosocial context in which the patient is inserted, contributing to the development of humanistic attitudes among students and future physicians. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of cinema as an educational resource in teaching humanistic attitudes to medical students. Material and Methods A cross-sectional, quasi-experimental, qualitative and quantitative study was carried out with 107 students from the first to sixth year of the medical course of the Federal University of Amapá. The Medical Students Attitude Scale (validated by the author Maria de Fátima Colares, 2002) was used before and after the exhibition of films related to relevant themes in the medical area. This psychometric scale is composed of multiple-choice Likert-type responses and aims to assess the attitudes of medical students regarding the following factors: primary health care; psychological and emotional aspects involved in diseases; ethical aspects in professional practice; mental illness, death-related situations; scientific research. The Wilcoxon Rank Test was used to compare data from paired samples. Results All the factors evaluated by the medical students attitudes scale related to relevant aspects of medical practice showed a significant increase in the frequency of positive attitudes (p < 0.05) among the first- to fourth-year students following the cinema sessions. The fifth- and sixth-year students did not present significant changes in attitudes related to death, mental illness and contribution to the scientific advancement of medicine. Conclusion Cinema is an effective pedagogical tool in teaching humanistic attitudes in the preclinical series of the medical course.",

Methods This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study that recruited undergraduate medical students who had joined angiology and vascular surgery academic leagues in the state of São Paulo. On-line questionnaires were used to collect data on each league and the students took examinations to determine their performance. Results Most leagues had an entrance exam for enrollment, with an obligatory introductory course. Monthly theoretical lectures were held by 42.9\% of the leagues. Practical activities were provided by 85.7\% of the leagues. The majority of the leagues (71.4\%) were involved in scientific research. Paired-sample comparison of students' performance in the exams revealed a significant increase in mean scores, from 61.1 to 72.6 (p < 0.05). Conclusions The angiology and vascular surgery academic leagues in the state of São Paulo all function in a similar manner, but the range of theoretical, practical and scientific activities they offer are not uniform. For the sample investigated, the academic leagues appear to be effective at teaching angiology and vascular surgery during undergraduate courses.",

The objective of this study was to analyze the perception of the enrolled medical students troughout the transition from the traditional teaching given in High School to the PBL. This is an exploratory and qualitative study carried out in three higher education institutions. Data were obtained through focus groups, followed by content analysis. Three common thematic nuclei emerged from these lines. Students perceive the weakness of traditional teaching and its implications in their learning process. The students' view of PBL is positive but contradictory reflecting on the one hand, the anguish of a paradigmatic transition, but on the other hand it alerts to the possibility of misunderstandings in the conduction of PBL.",

There was a transition in psychiatry in São Paulo in this period, when the activities of the Juqueri Hospital were transferred to the School of Medicine at USP. This was decisively supported on the symbolic power of the psychiatric speech, which took over the axiom ``scientific being'' as an evaluative filter to appreciate or depreciate certain practices. Hypnosis remained immune to the ``scientific'' sieve of the same psychiatrists who adopted it as a clinical practice without submitting it to the same scrutiny applied to other practices, especially psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. By means of documents produced in the analyzed period, the authors aimed at identifying the thrust of these psychiatric speeches, pervaded with their so-called scientific dimension, which culminated in a strategy to either keep or not keep certain practices, such as hypnosis.",

It had the goal of mapping Revista Brasileira de Educação Médica (Brazilian Journal of Medical Training) based on the scientific articles about the connections between medical training and active methodologies. The bibliographic survey included 53 articles, which were grouped into four categories of analysis: comparative analysis of the syllabus models based on the traditional method and on the active methodologies; assessment of the syllabus change based on the use of active methodologies; assessment of professor performance with the use of active methodologies; and student training in the context of the active methodologies. The results indicate that the active methodologies are proposals that may fulfil the wish to promote syllabus changes in the medicine courses in Brazil, even though there still is not a consensus regarding the effectiveness of its use in this field. However, a closer look at the results enabled us to conclude that this process, when based only on the change in teaching method, may present gaps and proves insufficient to change the profile of the medicine graduates. Thus, we recommend the conduction of further researches in this field in order to better understand the uses of the active methodologies in the syllabus dynamics that form the basis of medical training in Brazil.",

We observed a significant expansion of the schools starting with the military dictatorship and peaking in 2014 (Dilma Rousseff), and the implementation of the More Doctors Program (Programa Mais Médicos, in Portuguese). Throughout the analyzed periods, the teaching of Medicine became ever more privatized, and was partially shifted to the Northern, Northeastern and Midwestern regions of Brazil, and to medium-sized and small municipalities in the countryside of the states. The results indicate that the combination of the management by the government of the health, education and socioeconomic development policies had an influence on the expansion of the Medicine undergraduate courses and the marked intra- and interregional differences.",

In Brazil, the More Doctors Program (Programa Mais Médicos, in Portuguese) introduced the most recent changes, establishing a new regulatory framework in the medical training, which is expressed in the National Syllabus Guidelines, emphasizing the development of professional abilities in primary health care. In the present study, we tried to analyze the social representations of medicine students about the work in primary health care within the context of the implementation of the aforementioned guidelines. In order to do so, 149 medicine students from `traditional' and `new' public courses in the Northeastern region of Brazil answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and a free evocation script in the second semester of 2017. The results show a student profile that corresponds to the `first university student generation' of the `new schools'. In these schools, the social representations of the medicine students are more in line with the new guidelines, with an emphasis on the evocation of terms such as `bond,' `responsibility' and `community.' In the `traditional' schools, the terms that stood out the most were `underappreciation,' and `precariousness,' which suggests that these students do not have enough experience in primary health care. We hope that the innovative experiences that were analyzed can be multiplied and deepened in the radicality needed for the strengthening of the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, in Portuguese), with training that is in line with the social needs.",

Methods: Stages of cross-cultural adaptation were as follows: translation by two independent evaluators, translation synthesis, evaluation by the target population for semantic equivalence, pilot study with 42 physicians, and final instrument preparation involving 224 heterosexual physicians practicing medicine in the Federal District. Invitations containing a link to the study were sent to physicians via e-mail, social media and medical associations. Inclusion criteria were as follows: being a physician authorized to practice medicine in Brazil, practicing medicine in the Brazilian Federal District, and self-declared heterosexual, as stipulated in the original version of the ATLG scale. Exclusion criteria were not disclosed to potential participants to avoid inhibition and unwillingness to participate; respondents meeting exclusion criteria were removed from the sample during data analysis. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested a one-factor solution to be the most representative of the data, including all 20 items with high reliability (composite reliability coefficients =0.948).

There has been growing investment in research in personalized or precision medicine, which aims to customize medical practice with a focus on the individual, based on the use of genetic tests, identification of biomarkers, and development of targeted drugs. However, the personalized or precision medicine movement is controversial and has sparked an important debate between its defenders and critics. This essay aims to discuss the assumptions, promises, limits, and possibilities of personalized or precision medicine based on a review of the recent literature situating the debate on the theme. The review indicates that many of the promises of personalized or precision medicine remain unfulfilled. While there has been huge progress in knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of diseases and the development of drugs that have significantly impacted the treatment of some types of cancer, thus far there is no evidence that this same pattern will be reproduced in other complex diseases. Personalized or precision medicine is expected to generate incremental developments in specific areas of medicine, but there are obstacles to its generalization. The high cost of new biotechnologies can exacerbate health inequalities and become a problem for health services' sustainability, especially in low and middle-income countries.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate a method aimed at teaching ultrasound techniques to medical students in emergency settings. Methods A prospective study conducted with 66 sixth-year undergraduate medical students. Students participated in theory and practicing sessions with a 5-hour load; knowledge acquisition was assessed through pre- and post-course and 90-day tests. A questionnaire were distributed to the students after course completion for theoretical and practical knowledge assessment. Results Average pre-test grade in theoretical content evaluation was 4.9, compared to 7.6 right after course completion, and 5.9 within 90 days (p<0.001). Questions addressing technical aspects and image acquisition were mostly answered correctly; in contrast, questions related to clinical management of patients tended to be answered incorrectly. In practical evaluation, 54 students (81.8\%) were able to correctly interpret images. Conclusion Ultrasound applicability and image acquisition techniques can be taught to medical students in emergency settings. However, teaching should be focused on technical aspects rather than clinical management of patients.",

This analysis goes even deeper under the scope of health promotion presented by the National Health Promotion Policy (PNPS), since it is closely related to a comprehensive care proposal. The new National Curricular Guidelines are in accordance with PNPS, since it aims at a general, human, critical, reflective and ethical education that is able to prepare medical students to work with social responsibility and commitment to advocate for citizenship and human dignity in different levels of care in the health-disease process. On the other hand, the analysis reveals that, although there is an attempt to place graduates as active subjects in their educational process, there is no sign of inclusion of these social agents in the creation of their educational practices.",

Chronic progressive and life-limiting health situations are more common in adults and the elderly, but may occur at all ages. Infants with complex chronic conditions (CCC) have clinical weaknesses, high morbidity and mortality rates and, therefore, demand sensory transformations about health care. This paper aimed to explore the challenges arising from the care of chronically ill babies and those who are subject to technological dependence from the perspective of health professionals (doctors, nurses and nursing technicians), seen as subjects capable of psychic elaboration and transformation of their professional practices. The experience of health professionals was approached from a qualitative study in a referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro in 2015, from interviews with 15 health professionals and participant observation. The analysis of the empirical material, dialogued between the French psycho-sociological clinical approach and the contributions of psychoanalysis, recognized and valued the challenges of care practice and the psychic repercussions on health professionals. We sought an in-depth understanding of the reality studied and the uniqueness of everyday experience, which was central to the appreciation of the psychic elaboration and the production of meanings of the subjects.",

Results: it was possible to notice that the classification according to the START method (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) was correct in 94.1\% of the time from the analysis of 17 preestablished checklists. Following the primary evaluation with the ABCDE mnemonic, all steps were performed correctly in 70\%. However, there was only supply of oxygen in high flow in 64.7\% of the examination. The search for visible and hidden bleeding was performed in 70.6\% of the examination. The neurological evaluation with the Glasgow coma scale and pupillary evaluation occurred in 70.6\% of the victims. The victims exposure was performed in 70.6\% of the examination. Conclusion: a simulated environment allows the consolidation and improvement of professional skills, especially when we are talking about a poorly trained area during the undergraduate program, such as the MVI.

Method: an investigation was conducted on the deaths classified as GC in 18 municipalities in the Northeast region as follows: identification of deaths with priority GC; review of medical records from health services and forensic institutes; and evaluation of the reclassification of causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and groupings of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 (GBD 2015). Results: among 18,681 deaths classified as priority GC, 7,352 (39\%) were investigated and, of these, 5,160 (70\%) had reclassified causes, of which 4,087 (79\%) were changed to specified causes. Ill-defined causes (n = 4,392) were the most frequent among GC and those with a higher proportion of cause change (80\%), and 57\% were changed to specified causes. The reduction of GC contributed to the detection of a wide variety of specific causes according to groups of level 3 of the GBD 2015, being the interpersonal violence the cause that obtained the highest percentage change (11.8\%).

Methods Students of the 1st and 6th year of medical school were evaluated. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between the outcome (use of hookah in the last 30 days) and demographic, subjective psychosocial data and level of knowledge about the harms of hookah use. Results The experimentation rate of hookah and current use was high (59.6\% and 27.7\%, respectively), with no difference between the 1st and 6th year groups (p=0.70). The 6th grade students were more knowledgeable about the harm of using hookah when compared to the 1st year students (p <0.0001), and there was no association between the use of hookah in the last 30 days and the knowledge about its harms.

Previously supported by printed material, problem solving in clinical practice has recently been aided by digital tools known as summaries platforms. Doctors and medical students have been using such tools from questions found in practice scenarios. These platforms have the advantage of high-quality, evidence-based and always up-to-date content. Its popularization was mainly due to the rise of the internet use and, more recently, of mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, facilitating their use in clinical practice. Despite this platform is widely available, the most of them actually present several access barriers as costs, foreign language and not be able to Brazilian epidemiology. A free national platform of evidence-based medical summaries was proposed, using the crowdsourcing concept to resolve those barriers. Furthermore, concepts of gamification and content evaluation were implemented. Also, there is the possibility of evaluation by the users, who assigns note for each content created. The platform was built with modern technological tools and made available for web and mobile application. After development, an evaluation process was conducted by researchers to attest to the valid of content, usability, and user satisfying. Consolidated questionnaires and evaluation tools by the literature were applied. The process of developing the digital platform fostered interdisciplinarity, from the involvement of medical and information technology professionals. The work also allowed the reflection on the innovative educational processes, in which the learning from real life problems and the construction of knowledge in a collaborative way are integrated. The assessment results suggest that platform can be real alternative form the evidence-based medical decision-making.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Considering the high prevalence of mental illnesses, it is essential for any physician to offer proper treatment and attention to people with these disorders. Nevertheless, the usual stigma and lack of knowledge regarding the management of mental disorders on the part of physicians can represent a significant barrier to treatment and inefficiency faced by patients in the health care system. Objective This study aimed to measure the gain of psychiatric knowledge and the reduction in the stigmatization of people with schizophrenia by medical students after exposure to the compulsory internship program at a public medical school in the Federal District. Methods Quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact of the training program during medical internship in the final year of undergraduate medical training. The sample was 35 final-year medical students. Questionnaires were applied to measure the degree and type of stigma in relation to schizophrenia and self-perception regarding the drug management and treatment of psychiatric diseases. A three-point Likert scale was used to measure the results. The questionnaires were applied immediately before and after exposure to the four-week training program. The medical values of self-perception and stigma were compared between two moments using the Student's t test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference found between stigmatization before and after the intervention (total stereotype, p = 0.230; perceived prejudice, p = 0.172; social distance, p = 0.209; civil rights, p = 0.837). Regarding self-perception of knowledge, the number of items reaching total confidence and the mean values after the training were significantly improved (p = 0.007 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There was no correlation with sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion Despite the knowledge gain, medical students failed to show any improvement in the degree of stigma held after immersion in a 4-week practical psychiatric training program. The short duration of the intervention might have meant that the students' contact with patients was insufficient to reduce stigma. More studies are needed with larger groups and experimental designs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Results Although clinical nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of many leading causes of cardiovascular mortality around the world, a large proportion of medical students do not feel properly prepared to give nutritional advice to their patients. The teaching of nutrition in medical school has therefore become imperative. Although the practice of clinical nutrition in Brazil, as in many other countries, is the responsibility of physicians, adequate curricular training at medical school is rare. The main objective of this study, therefore, was to assess the attitudes and knowledge of medical students regarding clinical nutrition. The final sample of this research consisted of 87 students currently in their final year of a private medical school in Belem, surveyed between May and June 2018. Attitudes toward nutrition were measured using previously validated questionnaires. Knowledge was assessed using a multiple-choice quiz adapted from a previous 2008 study conducted by Vetter. This study followed international rules for human research. The statistical analysis was performed using the software Bioestat ® 5.3. Of the 92 participants, 87 (94\%) completed the survey. Although 94.3\% claimed to have a positive attitude towards nutritional care, students showed ambivalent perspectives concerning the efficacy of physicians in clinical nutrition. 95.3\% agreed that it was a physician's duty to advise high-risk patients about dietary change, yet the average correct score on the knowledge quiz was 61.3\%. Knowledge was lacking in the areas of nutrition for surgical patients, nephrology diseases and gynecologic/obstetric patients. There was no correlation between attitudes and knowledge in clinical nutrition. Neither a familiar requesting nutritional care nor the specialty chosen was associated with a difference in knowledge or attitude items. This study concluded that senior medical students perceive nutrition counseling as a priority, but lack the knowledge to provide adequate nutritional education to patients.",

It was verified that there is a great demand for specialist consultations not met by the public health network.

In parallel, the offer of residency places was relevant to the number of local graduates; however, it was observed that vacancies remained idle in all evaluated years, especially for Family and Community Medicine residency. Finally, the number of specialist physicians working in the private sector was much higher than the number of those working in the public sector, including those with the greatest deficiency in public health care. Even with the mobility that characterizes the complementary medical training through residency, local necessities could influence the placement of the specialist physician. The discussion about the parameters of the offer/expansion of medical residency vacancies is considered, bearing in mind that the reduced number of specialists in Family and Community Medicine working in the network can interfere in the increased referrals to other specialties. Thus, the identification of health demands is insufficient to guide the expansion of residency vacancies, especially considering the training of the specialist physician in relation to the labor market.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Hyperhidrosis is the excessive production of sweat by the body, which can be primary or secondary and generalized or localized. The craniofacial, axillary, palmar, dorsum, inner thigh, and plantar regions are commonly affected. Primary hyperhidrosis (HP), although a benign disease, has an imminent negative impact on the patient's quality of life. This disease is quantitatively classified according to the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, based on how the disease affects daily activities, ranging from mild to severe intensity. Medical undergraduate students face physical and emotional stressful situations during their tasks, and when they have a chronic illness such as HP, they can be stigmatized as unsafe for their profession. The objective was to define HP prevalence, diagnostic criteria, severity and impact on the quality of life in the professional and extracurricular scenario of undergraduate medical students. This is a cross-sectional quantitative study of a descriptive nature, including 300 students from the Tiradentes University medical school, in Aracaju-SE, from August to November 2017. Absolute and relative frequencies were used in the case of categorical variables and measures of central tendency and variability were used for numerical variables; p value was considered significant when p <0.05. The prevalence of HP in medical students was 18\%, with no difference between the genders and with the predominance of white and brown ethnicities. The disease occurred mainly in combined sites, such as palmar-plantar, with the palmar region being the most affected one. The symptoms began mainly during childhood and adolescence, with significant impairment in daily personal and work activities, with disease exacerbation under stress situations. The most common HP severity was moderate, with a negative impact on quality of life, mainly reported at the more advanced stages of the disease, hindering academic activities. It is important to include the knowledge of HP in the medical curriculum for a greater dissemination of information on the disease, allowing its early diagnosis and related to the intensity of sweating in its therapeutic approach.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT In the international academic community, effective communication between health professionals, patients, and their families are recognized as an indispensable condition for the quality of health care. In Brazil, the National Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Medical Schools established that medical students should be prepared to communicate through verbal and non-verbal language, with empathy, sensitivity and interest, promoting patient-centered care, and a horizontal and shared relationship with the patient. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to implement curricular activities that promote the development of this skill and assess its acquisition during undergraduate medical school. Adequate communication skills cannot be learned by observation alone and tend to decline as medical students progress through their medical education. For the assessment of communication skills, experts recommend a framework that allows for repeated assessment and feedback opportunities, reinforcing the use of the most basic interviewing skills to the most complex ones, such as communicating bad news. Thus, for an efficient assessment, methods and instruments with a solid theoretical basis are necessary. Thus, activities in a simulated environment with the participation of standardized patients have been widely used for the teaching and assessment of these skills during the clinical consultation. In this context, faculty development programs are fundamental for effective teaching and assessment strategies to be implemented and allow the future doctors to acquire essential skills for their professional practice. This article proposes a narrative review of communication skills assessment in a simulated environment regarding its concepts, challenges, and possibilities. It also discusses practical aspects for the organization of this type of assessment.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Stress corresponds to physical, psychological and hormonal responses that occur when the body needs to adapt to a challenging situation. It is one of the most recurrent responses in the academic world due to the exhaustive routine and dense content that demand responsibility and competitiveness from the students. In medical undergraduate schools, we add to these factors the student's concern to learn the content that was discussed in class and the pressure exerted by the students themselves, in addition to the demands of society. Given the relevance of the topic, this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of stress during medical undergraduate school in students from a private university in the Alto Tietê region, in the state of São Paulo. Two research instruments, the Lipp Adult Stress Symptom Inventory (ISSL) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were applied to n= 420 undergraduate students (67.14\% females) attending the basic (first and second years) and vocational cycles (third to sixth years), and all participants were volunteers. According to the PSS, higher levels of stress were observed in students from the first to the third years, when compared to students from the fourth to the sixth years of medical school. The ISSL demonstrated the occurrence of stress in 65\% of the students, of which 9.04\% were in the ``near exhaustion'' phase and 0.95\% in the ``exhaustion'' phase, which represent the highest levels of stress, with the occurrence of symptoms being more prevalent in female students. Among all the analyzed groups, students attending the first to the third years showed a higher stress index than the others, which may be associated to the distribution of curricular contents with the predominance of conceptual disciplines, as well as the process of transition from theoretical contents to practical activities. These results may be related to the students' adaptation to the university routine, to the courses taken and to the obligations that higher education demands.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective This is a descriptive study divided into two distinct approaches to voluntary work among medical students. This article sought to understand the level of engagement of these students in voluntary projects and the repercussions generated by working in a volunteer project of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in a group of students. Methods The study was carried out in two parts. The first part is a cross-sectional study involving quantitative analysis, through which, with the use of an online questionnaire in Google Forms, 135 first- to sixth-year medical students from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) were interviewed. Participants were asked whether or not they had engaged in voluntary services and the reasons for doing so. The second part of the article is a cross-sectional, qualitative analysis that evaluated the impact of the voluntary project ``Caring for your health in Ponto dos Volantes'', promoted by the UFMG Medical School on the life of the participants. The project took place in July 2017 in Vale do Jequitinhonha, Minas Gerais, with 19 members, all of them undergraduate medical students. The opinions of 15 of the 19 students participating in the project were evaluated through the Google Forms platform. Results The results of the first study showed that 108 (80\%) of the participants had previously done some voluntary work and 97.3\% of them would like to participate in another similar activity. When questioned about the benefits that volunteering provided, personal growth was the most common answer, with 94 (25.06\%) votes out of 375 votes; enhancing one's curriculum vitae was not among the most voted, obtaining only 23 (6.13\%) votes. Among those with no interest in volunteering, lack of time was the most common reason. In addition, 110 (81.48\%) of the study participants stated that they would like to volunteer after graduation. In the second study, all 15 students (100\%) who answered the questionnaire showed interest in carrying out new voluntary work. When asked about the impact of volunteering on their lives, only positive aspects were raised, such as valuing one's life and that of others. As for the reason for engaging in the project, the vast majority mentioned the possibility of learning about different realities from daily life and college services. Conclusion Together, the two studies show that voluntary work has become a well-known feature in the life of UFMG medical students and that non-engagement in such projects is more due to lack of knowledge and dissemination than to lack of interest. Our study concluded that greater investment in the creation and dissemination of academic voluntary projects is needed and that this reality should be expanded not only within universities across the country but in schools and communities as a whole.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical training can generate huge responsibilities for the students and cause various behavioral, mental and physical problems. Considering this fact, we need to problematize strategies to promote the physical and mental health of medical students, as highlighted by the National Guidelines for Undergraduate Medical Education in Brazil. This experience report aims to problematize an initiative of a curricular axis of Public Health of a Brazilian Federal University, focused on the improvement of competencies related to health promotion. During the third curricular unit of this axis, the students were challenged, through the Arch of Maguerez, to improve competencies related to health promotion and salutogenesis, according to the principles of SUS and Public Health Policies, especially the National Policy for Health Promotion. After that, the curricular unit that included this theme was collectively constructed, with dialogue and affection between students and teachers. We began with the students' reality, to learn about Health Promotion and, thus, to be able to transform it. The developed activities, within a component of the formal curriculum of a medical course, allowed them to learn and become aware of the relevance and practice of Health Promotion in everyday life. Efforts were made to expand and promote health and well-being in a free and autonomous way. Empowered with these knowledges and based on the proposed pedagogical objectives, the students built the final activity of this unit. The place where it occurred showed to be effective in producing health and in constituting a scenario of teaching and learning for medical training. It was understood that health promotion, based on activities contextualized with the students' realities and needs, as part of the academic routine, has a transformative potential for their health, and can prepare them for a medical practice that is ethical, relational, affective and co-responsible. The experience was innovative, because it faced the incoherence of teaching Health Promotion without practicing it, in a context where the physical and mental health conditions of medical students have become more precarious. Thus, the opportunity to learn about the subject was used to develop skills and to experience Health Promotion within the students' reality, preparing them for the interventions with the community, which occurred next. The activity was positively evaluated, highlighting the relevance of Public Health in the medical training, aiming to think about the interfaces between the self and the other, our similarities, differences and need for transformations in the meetings that the undergraduate school and the medical profession provide.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Empathy is an attribute of the clinical act, of fundamental importance for the establishment of a good doctor-patient relationship. Medical undergraduate courses should guide the students' training, with the purpose of developing skills that favor the qualification of a decisive professional and able to understand the importance of teamwork. This study aims to analyze the learning of empathy in undergraduate students of medical courses from public universities in the Northeast of Brazil, which are in their last year of medical internship. In order to do so, we sought to understand these students' empathy conceptions, to know how the learning for an empathic attitude during medical training occurred and to identify how to improve this learning. A qualitative methodology was used, and focal groups were used with students from two different universities, whose speeches were submitted to a thematic analysis, which tried to apprehend the conceptions of empathy, its learning during undergraduate school and the suggestions for the improvement of its teaching / learning. The results pointed out that students do not recognize or identify relevant teaching moments during their training in relation to the learning of empathy and, when mentioned, they associate it more to theory than to medical practice. They emphasize that the methodology used is not very stimulating and that teachers lack training. They also request an institutional look at their mental health. There were no significant differences between the gender and the age of the students regarding the empathic disposition. It is concluded that this research confirmed the initial assumption: that the medical undergraduate course, in general, has not adequately prepared students for the practice of empathy in the doctor-patient relationship. For these students, the ``capacity to put oneself in the other's shoes'' stands out as difficult, thus strengthening the need for a more careful look at the training scenario in order to intervene more adequately to increase the learning of the empathy component.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The new National Curriculum Guidelines of the undergraduate medical course (DCN-2014) emphasize collective health as a way to ensure social commitment in medical education. However, they do not clearly indicate the skills to be acquired and content to be worked in this field. This gap needs to be filled, given the need to guide the vast number of new medical courses, which followed the ``More Doctors'' policy in Brazil. Objective To identify the challenges of collective health in medical education and to build a strategic planning tool to support medical schools in designing and monitoring this component of the curriculum of their courses. Method The method comprised two stages: 1) critical analysis of key medical education documents (DCN and REVALIDA Matrix) and 2) construction of a strategic planning tool to support the development of the collective health curriculum in undergraduate programs by conducting workshops using the ``outcome mapping method'. Results The documents analyzed disclose great variability in the understanding of the collective health role in medical training and practice. While the REVALIDA Matrix, published in 2009, establishes the 5 medical areas with no reference to collective health, the DCN, published in 2014, seems to overestimate this field. However, since there is no clear definition of skills and content, collective health often suffers from reductionism and seems to be mistaken by or overlap with family and community medicine. The participatory workshops took on the challenge of reversing this reductionist vision, building a tool based on the physician's vision in the future, with the mission of requiring collective health skills and contents in the curriculum. Partners have been identified for the implementation of this component, as well as the attitudes and changes expected from each partner, and how to monitor their progress. Conclusion The tool, based on the outcome mapping method, focuses on people's achievements and changes. It is a flexible, participatory device and can contribute to the construction of curricula that will train physicians committed to the social reality.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Communication is a dynamic and open process and, in the field of health, it involves from the transmission of messages to obtaining information. ``Bad news'' can be considered all information that involves a drastic and negative change in the patient's life and regarding the perspective of the future. To give ``bad news'' to the patient includes everything from a diagnosis of a terminal illness, to pathologies that interfere with their quality of life. In Brazil, there is a problem regarding this subject, because there is not much content in the curricular grid about the communication of bad news, as well as little practice on the use of communication methods. This directly impacts both the professional and personal life of the future physician, as well as the relationship with the patient. The present article is a cross-sectional descriptive study, carried out in the cities of Joinville and Jaraguá do Sul, and the project was submitted to and approved by the institutions' ethical assessment according to Brazilian standards. It aims to describe the understanding of sixth-year undergraduate medical students and first-year residents when dealing with the reporting of bad news. The sample consisted of 63 participants, with data collected from a questionnaire, between April and September 2018 and analyzed descriptively in terms of frequency of each response. As for the results, it is noteworthy that the task considered the most difficult one was to talk about the end of an attempted curative treatment; 61\% considered themselves reasonably skilled regarding the ability to communicate bad news, and that involving the family member or patient in the decision-making process is the most difficult factor during the discussion. In addition, 74\% of the participants were unaware of any method of communication and 44\% believed that practical classes with real patients would be an effective way of learning. Therefore, it is concluded that the lack of preparation to mediate such situations implies in heterogeneous behaviors that could be avoided with instructions and would contribute to the best training during undergraduate medical school.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 physicians from family health care teams, using simple descriptive statistics and content analysis in a thematic-categorical mode to organize and analyze the data. The results indicated a predominance of female, Brazilian professionals aged between 24 and 35 years, trained in public institutions and specialized in the field of Family Medicine. Most interviewees belong to the Mais Médicos Program , and have remained in the same team for up to 3 years. The prominent advantages were the identification of the professionals with the work proposal and professional valuation, while the disadvantages were the unstable employment relationship, disregard by management, workplace of difficult access, and excessive demands imposed on them. The facilitating points were teamwork and good relationship with the community, while the most challenging points were the lack of human resources, equipment, finances, and technology. We highlight the importance of the attention given by management to the difficulties to adapt the infrastructure of the Health Care Units and provide a work that contributes to change the health care of the population in this region. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink how physicians can be encouraged to remain in the Family Health Care Strategy, providing them with enhanced job security and prospects. However, it is worth underlining the importance of the profile of family doctors, whose training often diverges from the National Curricular Directives for medical training. These differences make it challenging to solve the issues indicated in this study due to the lack of knowledge about the role of primary healthcare, the importance of integration of the health care network, and lack of knowledge about the physician's attributes at this level of care.",

 author = "Oliveira, Felipe Proenço de and Santos, Leonor Maria Pacheco and Shimizu, Helena Eri",
 abstract = "ABSTRACT Several debates, in the national and international context, have suggested the need for changes in medical education, so that it is in line with the organization of health systems. From this perspective, it is proposed that schools be guided by social accountability, which consists of ordering teaching, research and activities in service to meet health needs with a focus on areas that are difficult to reach. A more recent reference in medical education at the national level was the More Doctors Program, which provided for a new regulatory framework for medical education. It is evaluated that the modifications introduced by the Program can influence the elaboration of new social representations of medical students. Through the theory of social representations, a qualitative study was carried out to analyze the perception about the social accountability of the medical schools of 149 medical students, of the seventh semester of four courses of Federal Higher Education Institutions in the Northeast Region. Two of the courses are in the interior and were created by virtue of the More Doctors Program and another two correspond to courses in the state capital existing for more than 60 years. From the curriculum analysis of each course, they were termed ``traditional'' or ``new''. In the results, it was observed that the students of the different courses resemble each other in terms of admission by quotas, but students of ``new'' courses have a greater entrance under affirmative action policies, including regional access criteria. Both groups of students have emphasized the term ``duty'' as a priority, which may refer to a more individual scope of the notion of accountability. The terms ``citizenship'' and ``ethics'' were also highlighted in both groups. Only for students in ``new'' schools were terms such as ``commitment'', ``justice'' and ``SUS'' cited. This insight suggests a broader notion of social accountability in school students created under the More Doctors Program, despite insufficient national literature on this topic. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of the Program in the implantation of medical schools in regions that did not previously have this training. It also reinforces the relevance of the dedication of the teachers who implemented the courses in the interior of the Northeast, demonstrating the need to deepen in the themes that involve teacher development. It is suggested that there is a need to broaden the analysis of experiences such as these, so that they can be explored with the radicalism necessary to strengthen the Unified Health System.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction In medical residency, residents play the dual role of teachers and learners. Training programs aiming at teaching residents how to become teachers are being implemented around the world and are referred to as `Resident as teacher' (RaT) programs. According to the National Curricular Guidelines of the Medical Undergraduate Course, one can learn to establish educational goals and competence matrix, as well as skills such as communication, empathy, mediation of conflicts, among others. The implementation of these programs should be based on the understanding of the context of each medical residency where they are to be included and the residents should also know the potential of each scenario of their specialty to promote an effective teaching. Objective The objective of the study was the development of the structure of a Teaching Training Program (Resident as Teacher) divided into modules and detailed with their respective bibliographical references. Method a literature review was performed on medical education and some methods were tested in a practice scenario during a master's degree dissertation, using the SNAPPS technique, and during a doctoral thesis presentation using the OMP technique. Outcome A Teaching Training Program was built in medical residencies based on the positive results found in the medical education literature. It is proposed that each module has a duration of approximately one month, with activities lasting one shift per week. The format of the discussion may vary with each specialty and with the number of residents in each program. It is suggested that a flipped classroom situation be carried out, sending the bibliographic reference of support on the subjects to the residents by email one week before the completion of each module. Several activities can be implemented in each module to consolidate the studied material. Conclusion After structuring a script to be implemented by the residency programs in Brazil, residents are expected to more effectively play the role that many already exercise in practice and that the level of learning of undergraduate and internship students consequently improves.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Primary Health Care training demands contextualized pedagogical practices that promote active student participation and reflection on learning. From this perspective, digital narratives emerge as an innovative strategy that integrates the art of storytelling using different information and communication digital technology languages, enabling students to express, share, and reflect on their learning experiences. The integration of digital technologies in health education offers work options that are distant from a traditional practice, because resources such as a virtual learning environment, a blog or a social network suggest new ways of interaction and knowledge production. The aim of this study is to analyze the perception of students and their teacher about the contribution of blogs as spaces for the construction of digital narratives in the teaching-learning process, in Primary Health Care training. The study involved semi-structured interviews with nine students and one teacher, from a Medical course discipline at a Brazilian public university. This discipline discusses the teaching of Primary Health Care in the first semesters of the medical course. During one semester, the students produced digital narratives, noting down their thoughts on their contact with the patients/users of the health service, in the community, at different times, and the perspectives related to this Primary Health Care training process. The research data were organized and analyzed following the assumptions of content analysis. The main perceptions of the students and teacher showed they see blogs as spaces for constructing reflective narratives and for encouraging the collective production of knowledge, and also as an interface to promote student dialogue, subjectivity, and creativity. The results of this study corroborate the expectations about the contribution of digital narrative to a pedagogical practice that values the active participation of both educators and students, allowing a dialogical movement in the teaching-learning process and new ways of thinking about education and the role of the subjects involved.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The aging of the world's population brings with it the increase in chronic diseases, although without a concomitant improvement in quality of life or management of the diseases. In this context, palliative care constitutes an interdisciplinary care model aiming at the integral care of the human being. In contrast, the incessant search for a cure can result in a sense of denial and defeat when facing death. Approaching this subject is necessary during medical school, so that future professionals feel adequately prepared and secure, thus providing the best care for their patients. Purpose To evaluate the knowledge on palliative care of undergraduate medical students of Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina (UNISUL), campus Tubarão. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out through the application of an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire containing 39 questions, divided into 12 sociodemographic questions and 27 objective questions about palliative care. Data collection was carried out from March to June 2018. The Chi-square test (X2), Fisher`s exact test, Likelihood ratio, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's tests were used. The significance level was set at 5\%. Results A total of 188 medical students, of which 56.9\% were females, at the prevalent age range between 21 and 25 years old participated in the study. In the case of an oncological patient, 3.2\% (6) of the interviewees would prefer that treatment decisions be made only by the physician, of which 83.3\% (5) were males (p = 0.04); 49.5\% (93) of the interviewees declared themselves prepared to face the process of death and grief, of which 54.8\% (51) were males (p = 0.005); 80.3\% (151) of the students denied having acquired skills to communicate bad news, of which 62.9\% (95) were females (p <0.001). The students at the 10th semester of the Medical course showed a better average of right answers to questions about the pharmacology of pain management. Most students considered important the incorporation of palliative care content in the curriculum, but 68.1\% of them had no interest in working in this area. Conclusion In conclusion, the teaching of the palliative care subject during UNISUL's medical course resulted in an adequate knowledge of internship students; however, there is some difficulty when facing the process of death and insecurity when approaching the communication and medical attitude. It is necessary to improve the teaching of capabilities and skills in the area, emphasizing universal care focused on the patient and not only on curing diseases, as well as mobilizing efforts to encourage the students' self-esteem.",

Variables studied: age, gender, marital status, financial dependents, number of attempts at the university entrance exam for the medical course, current semester of study, previous undergraduate training, living with parents, choice of course by parental influence or pressure. Uni and multivariate Poisson analysis were carried out to assess the factors associated with intrinsic motivation; p <0.05 was considered as the significance level for statistical purposes. Average motivation score was 3.8, which indicates motivation. In 2 nd , 6 th and 10 th semester medicine students, the final model maintained as the variable associated with intrinsic motivation those who attempted the medical school entrance exam once or twice compared to those who had had three or more attempts (PR = 0.88, 95\% CI (0.79-0.97), p = 0.011). In the analyses assessed by semester, in the second semester, students who had prior undergraduate training before medical school compared to those who had not was the remaining variable (PR = 0.92, 95\% IC (0.87-0.97), p = 0.005). In the sixth semester, no statistically significant difference was found, and in the tenth semester the variable of those who attempted the medical school entrance exam once or twice remained (PR = 0.65, 95\% IC (0.47-0.88), p = 0.006). The students seemed to be motivated in the group tutorial activity. The fewer number of medical school entry exam attempts and having previous undergraduate training were variables that showed association with intrinsic motivation.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective to evaluate the effectiveness of the 3D virtual anatomical table as a complementary resource to the learning of the hepatobiliary anatomy by undergraduate medical students. Method A randomized controlled study comparing the anatomical learning of hepatobiliary structures, supported by a real model versus a virtual model, both three-dimensional (3D), by undergraduate medical students. The students' perception of the resources used to teach anatomy was also evaluated. The students were submitted to a pre-test and to two evaluations after the interventions were applied. Results Overall, both the 3D virtual anatomical table and the real liver increased students' knowledge of the hepatobiliary anatomy in relation to their previous knowledge (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively for second and third evaluations). In the longitudinal comparison between the pre-test and the second evaluation (hepatobiliary anatomy and Couinaud's segmentation), this increase was significantly higher in the group allocated to the real liver (p = 0.002); in the comparison of the pre-test with the third evaluation (inclusion of adjacent organs in the anatomical table or in the real liver), the increase in knowledge was significantly higher in the group allocated to the anatomical table (p = 0.04). The perception of participants' satisfaction regarding the learning resources was considered very good, with a minimum percentage of satisfaction of 80\%. Conclusion the 3D virtual anatomical table provided more hepatobiliary anatomy knowledge than a real liver for undergraduate medical students, in comparison to their previous knowledge about these structures. In the cross-sectional comparison of the post-instruction evaluations, there was no difference between the two interventions. Moreover, the 3D platform had a positive impact on the level of satisfaction of study participants. This study shows that the 3D virtual anatomical table has the potential to improve both medical students' understanding and interest in anatomy. It is recommended, however, that future protocols such as this be carried out with larger samples and exploring other anatomical structures.",

In spite of the forgetfulness of `Sociology of Medicine' in the Public Health debates that address the relations between Health and Social Sciences, this work presents essential issues for the sociological understanding of health field phenomena.

In primary health care predominates a blend of physiopathological and semiological EMs comprised of low to moderate risk patients. In this scenario, the introduction of T\&CM practices can enhance family physicians' therapeutic scope.

Methods: A cross-sectional study evaluating 218/227 platelet concentrate records in children and adolescents (zero to 13 years old), from January 2007 to April 2015, by the pediatricians of the emergency room, sick bay and intensive care unit. The requisitions were excluded in patients with hematological diseases and those without the number of platelets. Results: Children under 12 months received 98 platelet concentrates (45.2\%). Most of the transfusions were prophylactic (165; 79\%). Regarding the transfusion site, 39 (18\%) were in the emergency room, 27 (12.4\%) in the sick bay and 151 (69.6\%) in the intensive care unit. The trigger, prescribed volume and platelet concentrate subtype were adequate in 59 (28.2\%), 116 (53.5\%) and 209 (96.3\%) of the transfusions, respectively. Patients with hemorrhage presented adequacy in 42 (95.5\%), while children without bleeding presented in 17 (10.3\%). The most common inadequacy related to volume was the prescription above recommendation (95; 43.8\%). Eight platelet concentrates were prescribed with subtype requests without indication. Conclusion: The results obtained in this study showed that transfusion of platelet concentrate occurred more adequately in children with active bleeding compared to prophylactic transfusion. There was a tendency to prescribe high volumes and platelet subtypes not justified according to current protocols. The teaching of transfusion medicine should be more valued at undergraduate and medical residency.",

Health professionals in RUTE-member institutions plan a program of video conferences and/or web conferences to discuss specific themes. This article presents the results of an analysis of the collaboration between the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) of the Telemedicine University Network (RUTE) considering the SIGs production in communication, cooperation and coordination (3C). Methods A survey was applied to SIG coordinators between April and May 2016. The classification of SIGs into homogeneous groups considered the activities developed in the network between 2007 and the time of the survey application. The study is retrospectively based on historical data from units, institutions and SIGs. The coordinators of 71 RUTE SIGs were invited to respond. Of those, forty-five active SIGs responded to the evaluation survey in its entirety and were considered in the analyses. Results Almost one third of the respondent coordinators (35\%) stated that their SIG works in the education axis, 21\% work in the care and research, development and innovation axes, while 12\% work in management and 11\% in evaluation. The SIGs were grouped into three homogeneous categories: emergent collaboration, collaborative development, and full collaboration, and it was identified that 71\% of the 45 SIGs (11 in the emerging and 20 developing groups) use email as the main extra-session communication tool. Four SIGs from the full collaboration group reported: use of instant messaging service (1 SIG), own website (1 SIG) and social networks (2 SIGs). Conclusion The results of this study suggests may not accurately gauge the actual production and collaboration that SIGs develop and this analysis can be considered as a starting point or as a reference for the RUTE community. However, the results suggest significant growth in collaboration between RUTE-member SIGs, indicating a positive trend for the RUTE regarding the interest, participation and dissemination of actions in telemedicine and telehealth in the country.",

A Facebook® page was created to promote the health of the population through creative, critical and accessible posts. The undergraduate students became the protagonists of the activity, since the choice of topics, the active search for high-quality scientific sources, responsibility for each post and page management were attributed to them, while they were supervised by the professors. Interaction with the non-academic community was obtained, since the page was divulged to reach all the population, contributing to health education and consequent autonomy of care by the individuals. Thus, the students' posts reached many citizens, who, in addition to accessing relevant health information, could ask questions and make comments on the topic. Therefore, the experience allowed the development of skills such as Communication, Leadership, Health Care and Administration and Management, as recommended in the National Guideline for Undergraduate Medical Education. However, there are some limitations, such as the need to have access to the Internet and smartphones. Considering the experience, it was concluded that the use of social media in the medical course is an effective way of developing skills and expanding and consolidating knowledge, with the undergraduate students being central to this process, since their active participation is required. Thus, it is proposed to replicate this experience in other teaching-learning environments in Health, not only in Medical Schools, especially with the use of this resource by Primary Health Care, allowing the formation of professionals more committed to the integrated care of the population, in agreement with the principles of the Unified Health System (SUS).",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The National Curricular Guidelines for Undergraduate Medicine Courses (2014) determine the profile of medical graduates as having a generalist, humanistic, critical, reflective and multicultural identity. This requires qualified biopsychomotor skills (skills of caring, healing and rehabilitating people and their families). The national psycho-pedagogical support centres find in these students personal, pedagogical and family conflicts translated into mental disorders. Will family dysfunctions be related to increased prevalence among medical undergraduate students (secondary socialization)? Would unsatisfactory primary socialization contribute to becoming ill in the ageing process? Objectives To verify the socio-demographic, psychiatric and family profile of medical students in a federal institution in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods The research was a qualitative-quantitative study, involving an observational intervention, and of an exploratory, transversal, descriptive and inferential nature. Data collection was performed through two strategies: (1) a self-administered questionnaire built for this research, with socio-psycho-demographic variables and dysfunctional family categories described in the literature. (2) the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Mini), 5.0.0 version, compatible with the DSM-IV criteria; Validated by Patrícia Amorim/2000. Data were collected after an Informed Consent Form (ICF) was signed and a database was created in Excel. The analysis was performed with the statistical software R. Quantitative variables were analysed by standard deviation, mean, median and mode. The qualitative variables underwent frequency analyses. Statistical tests were performed by Fisher exact test, bilateral Wilcoxon, chi-Square and Shapiro-Wilk, according to the variables and objectives of the analysis. The research was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee under number CAAE: 67590317.5.0000.5258, on 25/07/2017. Results 129 students were evaluated, aged 18 to 32 years, ranging from the 1st to 12th semester of the undergraduate course, 49\% were female and 51\% male. The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder was 39.53\%; depression (current or recurrent), 32.56\% and suicide risk, 28.68\%. Depression had a strong correlation with a family history of psychiatric disorder (p-value: 7.639 e-08) and the parents' relationship. It was present in those with divorced parents, widowed or without a relationship (P value: 0.008291). The risk of suicide was higher among students of the basic cycle, 1st to 4th semester of the course (p-value: 0.01), that had a strong correlation with suffering or still suffer bullying (p-value: 0.02), having a religion (p-value: 0.006), and depression (p-value: 0.03) or panic disorder (p-value: 4.903 e-05). There was a correlation between depression (p-value: 1.248 and-09) and suicide risk (p-value: 0.0009) in those who had communication problems in the family. Panic disorder was observed in 17.05\% of the interviewees, females (p-value: 0.00583). This stems from the parents' relationship. Students with married parents were the most affected. (p-value: 0.01284) Conclusions: The collected data showed correlations between family dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders such as depression, suicide risk, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. There is a need for a teaching/learning environment, including adequate spaces and scenarios, and also medical educators who can, at an early stage, identify psychological distress in the secondary socialization of the future physician.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Common mental disorders (CMDs) are increasingly frequent in the world's population and are less severe than other groups of mental disorders. They are associated with loss of quality of life, relationship problems and psychological suffering. The studies that investigate the prevalence of CMDs are aimed at the occupational, academic and health levels. Brazilian studies in the area of Mental Health carried out with medical students indicate that 30\% and 44\% of this group has some type of common mental disorder or symptom. The aim of the present study is to detect CMDs among medical students from Universidade Regional de Blumenau/SC. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in August 2017 with 340 students from the 1st to the 12th semester of School. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used for CMD screening. The prevalence of CMD was 50.9\%. Classic CMDs were associated (p <0.05) with the mean daily workload of more than 12 hours, less than one hour of leisure per day, having a previous medical history of psychiatric illness, using antidepressants, never having attended or been discharged from psychotherapy and the use of alcohol and other substances. A higher rate of suspected CMD cases was found in the present sample than in other studies with students from other Brazilian Medical Schools. The presence of CMD during the internship cycle was similar to that observed in the early cycles of medical school, despite the presence of protective factors, as demonstrated in the literature. The university must direct its attention to health promotion activities, together with health services and the family, creating a psychological support network. For this purpose, it has subsidies to establish prevention and care actions directed at the mental health of medical students.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Alcohol is a risk factor for several health conditions and accounts for more than three million deaths per year worldwide. The substance contributes to the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and cancer, as well as for acute conditions related to direct effects on the central nervous system. Despite this, its use is common practice among university students, including medical students. Objectives The objectives were (i) to develop a literature review to identify studies into the prevalence of alcohol use among students at Brazilian medical schools; and (ii) to analyze the estimates of prevalence according to medical course and school characteristics. Method Literature review developed to search publications in the (i) Latin American and Caribbean Center in Health Sciences Information (Lilacs) database, using the word combination [(estudantes de medicina AND álcool)] and in the US National Library of Medicine of National Institute of Health (Medline/Pubmed) database, using the word combination [(medical students AND alcohol AND Brazil)]. Alcohol use patterns in the past seven days, past thirty days, and past year were analyzed by plotting and visualization of point estimates and confidence intervals, as well as correlations. Results Fourteen studies were included in this review. Eight of them were developed in the southeast region. Most institutions were under public administration (n = 8), and were in state capitals (n = 8). The prevalence of alcohol use in the past seven days ranged from 23.0\% to 46.5\%, in the past thirty days ranged from 20.2\% to 87.6\%, and in the past year ranged from 79.3\% to 92.9\%. The correlations between prevalence and workload, and between prevalence and age of school showed a weak intensity on the three use patterns analyzed. The correlation directions followed diversified patterns. In the past seven days, the correlation directions were negative both with workload and age of the school. In the past thirty days, the correlation direction was negative with the workload, and positive with the age of the school. In the past year, the correlation direction was positive with workload, and negative with the age of the school. Conclusions Alcohol use is a recurring theme in Brazilian scientific literature and the estimates of prevalence of its use in the past seven days, in the past thirty days and in the past year are high among medical students. The influence of medical school and the medical course characteristics on the use of psychoactive substances requires more attention from the scientific community, and the involvement of the higher education institutions in controlling the alcohol problem in Brazil is fundamental.",

 author = "Pavan, Maria Valéria and Senger, Maria Helena and Marques, Waldemar",
 abstract = "ABSTRACT In 2006, the medical course of the Faculty of Medical Sciences and Health of PUC-SP (FCMS of PUC-SP) completely restructured its curriculum and pedagogical project and began to use active teaching/learning methods, centered on problem-based learning. There is often some resistance on the part of the teachers in relation to the changes, depending on the consequences for their daily practice. However, the participation of the teachers and their commitment to reform proposals are fundamental for them to occur and to be continually renewed. In this sense, this study had as objective to evaluate the teachers' view of the FCMS of the PUC-SP medical course on the changes triggered by the curricular reform; the impact of these changes on their own work, on the quality of the course and on the graduate doctor and, the suggestions to improve the curriculum, as part of the ongoing goal to produce well-trained professionals adapted to the needs of the population and to the health care system. The data were obtained through a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire, sent to the teachers working on the medical course. The second part of the questionnaire, object of this article, was to be answered only by the teachers who were already working before the curricular reform. Of the 178 teachers, 102 answered the questionnaire and, of these, 73 (71.6\%) had already worked on the course before the curricular reform and answered the second part of the questionnaire. In general, the teachers have a positive view of the changes triggered by the reform, with emphasis on the active role of the student in the teaching/learning process and the growth provided to the teacher, induced by the pedagogical model chosen. They also consider that there has been an improvement in the quality of the course and the graduate doctor. Although well evaluated, the change to an interdisciplinary model and the deficiencies of the physical structure and equipment made available for the course complicate the work of the teacher. The difficulty in evaluating the student and the lack of a permanent teacher development plan appear as the main problems to be faced in the search for improving the course.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The recognition of cultural characteristics of social groups, as well as their different needs and conceptions of the health-disease process is, according to Starfield, one of the important attributes derived from primary care: cultural competence. Through this attribute it is possible to develop strong bonds with the people and families who are the target of health care, resulting in greater satisfaction, more accurate diagnoses and greater adherence to treatment. Even in a country like Brazil, which still offers a free universal health system, minoritized populations – whether by ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status – face barriers to access these services and report poorer health indicators. Both the health professional and the user can belong to several cultural groups simultaneously, according to their gender, age, ethnicity, regionality, religion, sexual orientation, profession, role in the family, social class, as well as other characteristics and manifest in culturally distinct ways in different situations. It is important for the family physician to recognize the set of fundamental assumptions and values which influence their behavior and their interpretation of what is said by the other. Due to this complexity, these aspects should be considered in the discussion of the health-disease process and the construction of a shared care plan. This essay aims to discuss the development of cultural competence as a response to barriers health care access for minorities in the context of family and community medicine. An exploratory review of the literature was carried out, which also identified learning objectives and teaching strategies that can be incorporated into family and community medicine residency programs, aiming to collaborate with the systematization of teaching of this competence, respecting regional specificities. It also points out the need for institutional changes so that there is encouragement and appreciation of the practice of cultural competence, with the provision of time and infrastructure for the development of this competence by primary care professionals.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) are important tools in the effort to reduce the global issue of antimicrobial resistance. Ideally, the foundations of ASP should start to be conveyed in undergraduate medical training. Aim To identify the presentation of ASP concepts in the curriculum of a medical school. Material and methods A cross-sectional study conducted among medical teachers from the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF). The inclusion criterion was teaching ASP-related content in the undergraduate medical course. We analyzed which key-concepts were presented, the number of hours dedicated to presentation, the teaching methodologies and the evaluation methods. Results The study was conducted between December 2017 and January 2018 and included six of the 329 (1.8\%) teachers who taught on the Medicine course. The total hours dedicated to ASP teaching was 83; median of 3h/teacher, corresponding to 1.1\% of the total class hours for the whole course. Five out of six (83.3\%) teachers present at least one key component of ASP. The frequency of key ASP concepts presented was: specificity of treatment (5/6 - 83.3\%), duration of treatment (4/6 - 66.7\%), optimization of administration time (4/6 - 66.7\%), possible switching of administration method (3/6 - 50\%) and therapeutic drug level monitoring (2/6 - 33.3\%). Four out of six (66.7\%) teachers used combinations of teaching methodologies, which were reported in the following frequency: lectures (5/6 - 83.3\%), clinical cases (4/6 - 66.7\%) and problem-based learning (4/6 - 66.7\%). Fifty percent of the teachers employed combined evaluations to measure the concepts presented and the most common used were: short dissertation questions (3/6), clinical cases (2/6), multiple choice questions (2/6), clinical summaries (1/6), seminars (1/6) and long dissertation questions (1/6). Conclusions We verified that key ASP-related concepts were presented in a Rio de Janeiro medical school, with a combination of different methodologies constituting the main strategy to convey the concepts. Combinations of evaluations were used by half of the teachers to measure the contents presented. A requirement is observed to improve the teaching of important aspects such as when it is possible to switch the administration method and monitoring of the therapeutic drug level.",

In Brazil, more than 302,000 deaths from preventable adverse events were reported in 2016, and 70\% had preventable causes that cost more than 10.9 billion reais. Objective To evaluate the knowledge, skills and attitudes, through simulation of students of the medical course of the 4th and 8th semesters regarding the subject of patient safety. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. The data was collected through two instruments, one to ascertain the sociodemographic profile and the other to be completed during the simulation. The simulation took place in a laboratory room prepared to reproduce a hospital scenario. The researchers planned six risks to be identified in the scenario with a duration of 7 minutes. All data were analyzed by EPI-INFO 7.1. The research was approved by an ethics committee. Results A total of 42 students participated in the study, 24 and 18 of the 4th and 8th periods, respectively. No student has identified all six risks. Overall, students performed poorly, identifying on average two to three risks to patient safety. The risk of administration of wrong medication was perceived by 34 (81\%); lack of identification by 15 (36\%); risk of falling by 11 (26\%); problems with hand hygiene by 6 (14\%); risk of wrong surgical procedures by 3 (7\%) and risk of pressure ulcers was not identified by any student. Three additional risks not planned by the researchers were identified by the students, especially two risks identified by 8th-period students. Conclusion Students displayed little ability to identify patient safety risks. However, they demonstrated better performance throughout the course, revealing how important it is to work on patient safety in the early years of undergraduate training.",

 abstract = "RESUMO As disparidades no oferecimento de cuidado em saúde à população de Lésbicas, Gays, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais (LGBT) são evidentes e documentadas. O preconceito molda-se na naturalização de padrões instaurados e mantidos por diversas instituições, e a literatura corrobora com a existência de preconceito contra LGBT em escolas de medicina. A educação médica, historicamente consolidada em modelo biomédico-farmacêutico, concreto, positivista, hospitalocêntrico, com enfoque em um processo saúde-doença unicausal, representa um status conservador que se mantem rígido há um século. A despeito de programas e diretrizes nacionais e internacionais que orientam medidas inclusivas e de combate à discriminação, é verificada a presença de preconceito contra LGBT na prática médica e inclusive durante o processo educacional médico, notando-se atitudes preconceituosas entre os estudantes de medicina. Objetivo analisar o perfil de atitude e o preconceito contra diversidade sexual e de gênero entre estudantes de um curso de Medicina. Métodos foram empregados questionários autoaplicáveis a 391 estudantes de primeiro ao oitavo semestre de um curso de Medicina público da região sul do Brasil no ano de 2017. Resultados obteve-se uma taxa de resposta de 85,2\% dos entrevistados. O nível de preconceito com base nas assertivas variou de 69\% a 89\%. Entre os respondentes, 74,9\% concordaram que o sexo entre dois homens é errado, 83,9\% consideraram homens gays nojentos, 83,9\% acreditaram que a homossexualidade masculina é uma perversão, 80,9\% afirmaram que o sexo entre duas mulheres é totalmente errado, 83,9\% afirmaram que as meninas masculinas deveriam receber tratamento. Em relação à comparação da distribuição dos resultados quanto ao gênero declarado dos estudantes, observou-se que os estudantes autodeclarados masculinos foram mais preconceituosos que as estudantes autodeclaradas femininas. A distribuição de preconceito entre estudantes que se autodeclararam masculinos variou entre 81,5\% a 94,4\%, e entre as estudantes que se autodeclararam femininas, variou entre 57,3\% e 76,4\%. Os dados corroboraram para a importância de integrar a temática de saúde LGBT de forma obrigatória aos currículos e de construir mecanismos de apoio à estruturação pedagógica que auxiliem as aulas e/ou disciplinas a cumprirem seu papel.",

The way the communication is made, including its content, are important elements of the bond established between patient, health team, family and health institution. Considering the National Curricular Guidelines, learning is stimulated through active methodologies, with communication as part of the teaching-learning process, with the challenge of contemplating the communication of bad news in an effective way during formation. Objective To analyze the perceptions of medical students studying an organized curriculum with active methodologies about the communication of bad news in medical formation. Method This was a qualitative study, carried out at the School of Medicine of Marília. Thirty-nine students from the 1 st to the 6 th years of the medical course participated in the study. Data collection was performed through a semi-structured interview and the data were analyzed using the Content Analysis technique, in the thematic modality. Results and discussion Based on the analysis, four thematic categories were identified: Difficulty in defining bad news: product or process?; Is it possible to learn how to give or receive bad news from experience?; Difficulties in implementing an integrated curriculum: insufficient theoretical-practical articulation in bad news communication; and Valuing the communication of bad news: it takes theoretical, technical and emotional preparation. The results allow an important well-defined look at the perception of students about the communication of bad news within the curricular proposal. Final considerations It is pointed out that the study participants perceive the need for greater theoretical-practical articulation, training of teachers and care regarding the personal and professional formation of students regarding what comprises the communication of bad news. We expect the study to contribute to the broadening the perspectives on the subject, regarding the development of communication skills in health professionals, since the undergraduate years.",

The most sought after extracurricular trainings were in the urgency and emergency area (38.5 \%); there was an average of 0.93 articles published per student, with Pediatrics being the area with the highest number of publications (24,8\%). Moreover, there was a great disparity between the students' course load and the hours utilized by the course collegiate, with losses of 74\% in the extracurricular training activities and 63\% in monitoring + scientific initiation + extension activities. The results of this study point to the need to discuss and revise the Complementary Activities Regulations of the UEFS medical course, and may contribute to medical education, for discussing a topic disregarded by most undergraduate medical courses.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The psychological distress experienced by university students, particularly medical students, is well-known and has long been a cause for concern. In the School of Medicine of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, the School of Medicine Psychopedagogical Student Support Center (Núcleo de Apoio Psicopedagógico ao Estudante da Faculdade de Medicina - NAPEM) provides care to students who spontaneously seek help. The purpose of this study was to analyze the reasons described when completing the Napem application form by students for their seeking the assistance. A total of 273 students enrolled in the two years studied, which were both in the last decade. To preserve the identity of the students, the years analyzed were not identified. Of this group, 235 were medical students, 28 students of Speech Therapy, four undergraduate students of Technology in Radiology and six were students of other courses. The methodology used for data analysis was qualitative, with content analysis and the frequency comparison was performed using the chi-square test. The reasons to seek care written by the students in the application form were placed in five categories established by the researchers – ``mood disorders,'' ``personal problems,'' ``personality traits,'' ``academic issues'' and others. The results showed that ``mood disorders'' were the most frequently reported (44.3\%), followed by ``personality traits'' (26.4\%) and ``personal problems'' (13.9\%). The ``academic questions'' presented the lowest frequency (5.5\%). The desire to die was described by 17 (6.2\%) students. When the medical students were compared to the students of the other courses, there was no statistically significant difference among the frequencies of the five categories (p = 0.21) with motives allocated in the category ``mood disorders'' (41.7\%) being predominantly observed. However, when considering two studied periods separately, the frequency of the category ``mood disorders'' for medical students was significantly higher (p = 0.0005) in the second year than in the first year of study. It should be emphasized that almost 50\% of the students enrolled in the second year analyzed attended the centre for first two years, a significantly higher result (p = 0.002) when compared to those enrolled in the first year of the study. Even recognizing the limitations regarding the analysis of the student's preliminary demand for care when seeking help, particularly when expressed in written form, it is believed that the results of this study can contribute to the organization of psychological support services. Due to the magnitude of the problem, there is a clear need to have welcome spaces for the students with activities that can receive them and listen to them when they enter college, such as mentoring programs.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Health undergraduates and professionals feel embarrassment when facing issues concerning the sexuality of their patients. As a result, it is not uncommon to see the establishment of a superficial relationship, errors in diagnoses and the impossibility of giving treatment. Studies show that this difficulty is due to inadequate education of these professionals, especially regarding vulnerable groups whose experiences lie beyond the hegemonic heteronormativity which delimits the sexual field. In Brazil, there is limited research which aims to comprehend how this subject has been tackled in medical school. This investigation examined this issue and its main objective was to understand, from the perspectives of undergraduates at a federal medical school, how aspects regarding sexuality and gender are approached in the course. This is a qualitative research involving semi-structured interviews conducted with fifteen students in their final year of the course. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and examined based on content analysis. The subjects of the formal curriculum were also been analyzed, separating the titles of the classes which involved exclusively biological aspects from those which involved psychosocial aspects. Each one of these groups has been considered in relation to the total of content of the curriculum in order to assist us with the analysis of the interviews. The dialogue between the empirical categories and the bibliography shows the difficulty undergraduates feel in dealing with a theme that cannot be completely apprehended by technical and operational knowledge. The idea that the theme is not discussed in medical school contributes to hiding the fact that such a topic is, in reality, widely discussed. However, the approach used is organicist, contributing to the maintenance of binary, naturalized, essentialist categories which reinforce the norms that regulate the field of sexuality. Advocating the pivotal role that all individuals involved in medical education play, we finally discuss the need for qualitative changes in the curriculum which would enable us to build new forms of knowledge and performance. By valuing experiences, expertise and diverse pedagogical practices, these new forms can rupture the hegemonic dichotomies and hierarchies in order to positively transform social reality.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction From premed to graduating from medical school, more than just the academic content is required from students, and emotional preparation is necessary. Faced with a full-time course that demands intense dedication to achieve good theoretical-practical background and contemplate the curricular requirements and, being often far away from one's family, there is a diminished perception of quality of life in this group. This adaptation to physiological and emotional changes is capable of interfering with the disease process in this group of individuals, affecting their professional performance and the community where they will work at. Objective To know the life habits and disease processes of medical students of the Federal University of Alagoas throughout the medical course. In addition to seeking to understand the possible association between these factors and the high incidence of gastric complaints in this group. Methodology This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, comprising medical students from the 1 st to 8 th periods of the Federal University of Alagoas, separated by gender and course cycle. The Bardin method was used for the qualitative analysis of the content generated during the discussions with the groups. Results Through Bardin analysis , the final category of quality of life was reached in the female and male groups, both in the basic cycle and in the clinical cycle. This category derives from intermediate categories: access to a healthy diet, life habits and overall symptoms. An excessive workload was the groups' main complaint. The frequency of gastrointestinal complaints and those related to being away from the family is noteworthy. It is worth noting the peculiarities of each group in the initial categories, the competitiveness among female students from the 5 th to the 8 th periods and alcohol consumption among male students in the 5 th and 8 th periods. Discussion The decrease in the quality of life is a result of the curricular matrix with more than 8,000 hours. The consequences of this excessive workload is the stress that works as a trigger for poor sleep quality and lack of time to sleep; unhealthy eating habits; alcohol consumption; nervousness, anxiety, competitiveness; symptoms such as headaches, back pain and digestive symptoms and pathologies. With the Unified Selection System, being away from the family nucleus has transformed the profile and needs of this group, reflecting the financial conditions and additional responsibilities they need to assume. Final Considerations The results of this research about the main factors that lead to a decrease in the quality of life and the consequences of this process for the health of both male and female students during the different periods of medical school are in agreement with the national and international literature. There is a worldwide tendency that contemplates including self-care in the medical school curriculum, aiming to train more qualified professionals; hence, this article can make the university institutions aware of the need to intervene in the medical course.",

 title = "Health Professionals' Perceptions on the Integration of Medical Students' Training in Family Health Care Units",
 author = "Parma, Fabiana Arenas Stringari de and Oliveira, Raquel Aparecida and Almeida, Fernando Antônio",
 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The Centro Universitário de Votuporanga (UNIFEV) medicine course was implemented in 2012 according to the 2001 National Curricular Guidelines for Undergraduate Medical Courses. The practical module of Community Service Education Integration is the curricular unit that places students into Primary Health Care (PHC) scenarios from the first period of the course until the internship period, breaking with the traditional model of hospital-centered training, which is segmented into specialties. The module of medical skills and attitudes training also leads the student, in some cases, to PHC services, but with focus on the basic clinical procedures in controlled scenarios, which may be those from typical clinical practice, simulations or even those performed in laboratories. During internship, the student continues in PHC as an intern in general, family and community medicine. In this context, the integration of community-education-service plays a major role in the transformations undergone in undergraduate training in health, which are also aimed at modifying the current healthcare model. Objectives To understand the perception of professionals from the Family Health Care Units regarding medical student work placement and to interpret the results of this integration as far as the service, the community and the medical training are concerned. Methodology Qualitative research carried out with health professionals who work in three Family Health Care Units of Votuporanga, São Paulo, Brazil. They were invited to participate in focus groups to express their opinions about thought-provoking questions. The recorded material was transcribed, organized and analyzed according to Bardin's content analysis, which allowed categories of analysis to emerge based on what the participants said. Results and discussion: The opinions that have emerged allow to identify the following aspects: teaching-service-community integration contributes to medical education; student presence promotes team integration and self-learning and promotes the work process; student integration has impact on the community. Among the student's contributions, participants highlighted the academic and health care reflective practices, health education actions and complementary activities that support the health team in solving local problems. Participants also identified some situations of difficulty, such as: students in the early periods of the course need to acquire affective domains for an adequate professional posture at PHC units; the embarrassment of patients in the medical consultation with the presence of students; and the short length of stay of the students for the necessary bond building. Conclusion For PHC professionals, the inclusion of students in these scenarios contributes to the development of the service, medical training and community support. Due to the solidary relations existing between the educational institution and the PHC management, this research may contribute to promote the necessary adaptations and prepare the community and professionals for the presence of students in PHC.",

Methods: Cross-sectional study with application of questionnaires about vaccines, vaccine refusal and its repercussions on public and individual health. A sample of 92 subjects was selected from a private medical school: group 1 (53 students from first to fourth grades) and group 2 (39 physicians). Data collected were tabulated in the Microsoft Excel Program and analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Results: Both groups considered the National Immunization Program reliable and recognized the importance of vaccines, but 64.2\% of students and 38.5\% of physicians are unaware of the vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the basic immunization schedule. Most of the interviewees had a personal vaccine registry, but not all had received the 2015 influenza vaccine. Both groups had known people who refused vaccines for themselves or for their children (respectively, 54.7 and 43.3\% of students and 59.0 and 41.0\% of physicians). The total of 48.7\% of physicians had already assisted vaccine refusers. Appointed causes of vaccine refusal were: fear of adverse events, philosophical and religious reasons and lack of knowledge about severity and frequency of diseases. Ethical aspects of vaccine refusal and legal possibilities of vaccine requirements for children are not consensus. Conclusions: Medical students and doctors are not adequately vaccinated and have queries about the vaccination schedule, vaccine safety and vaccine refusal.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Twenty-six brachycephalic dogs with nostril stenosis, 22 males and four females, underwent bilateral rhinoplasty. Sixteen dogs were French Bulldogs; two, English Bulldogs; Six, Pugs; and two, Shih tzus, ranging in age from six months to six years. Blood samples were collected for hemogasometric analysis in the preoperative period and 30 days after surgery. For each evaluation, a 0.5ml sample of blood collected from the femoral artery was obtained in a heparinized plastic syringe. Hemogasometric evaluation was then performed on a blood gas analyzer (I-stat-Abbot®). The results of hemogasometry before and after rhinoplasty showed a reduction in the mean values of pCO2, TCO2, HCO3- and BEecf, hematocrit and hemoglobin, and an increase in pH, pO2 and SO2, indicating an improvement in the ventilatory condition of the animals after surgical correction of Nostril stenosis. Therefore, it is concluded that arterial hemogasometry is an important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of brachycephalic respiratory syndrome and is extremely useful in monitoring the patient's response to treatment. Rhinoplasty was effective in the treatment of respiratory syndrome, promoting improvement in hemogasometric parameters that indicate respiratory acidosis secondary to airway obstruction, common in the brachycephalic races.",

Dogs with HD were treated with carprofen 4.4mg/kg (GT n= 21) or with placebo (GP n= 19), both were administered once a day for 4 weeks. Evaluation was performed by the owners using the questionnaire (HCPI), the Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VASpain) and the VAS for locomotion (VASloc). The evaluation was performed 2 weeks before the treatment began (A1), immediately after treatment (A2), two (S2), four (S4) and two weeks after the end of treatment (S6) and the lameness was evaluated by pressure sensitive walkway. The internal consistency of the data was considered excellent (Cronbach´α coefficient= 0.89). There was a moderate correlation between the HCPI and VASpain. For VASloc the correlation was good. However, there was no difference between treatments, indicating low sensibility. No correlation was observed between pressure sensitive walkway and HCPI. We concluded that the questionnaire has construct and criterion validity, reliability and can be applied in dogs with osteoarthritis in Portuguese-speaking countries.",

A total of 2692 carcasses prior to system installation and 1940 after installation were sampled, totaling 4632 samples in five slaughterhouses under Federal Inspection in southern Brazil. Prior to installation of the washers, 156 carcasses were positive for Salmonella spp. and after installation, 83 carcasses tested positive, with a significant difference (P <0.05/OR 1.4) on the overall results. Two of the five evaluated slaughterhouses showed a prevalence decrease of Salmonella spp. in the sampled carcasses after installing the washer. However, in three establishments, there was no significant difference after installing this system. The results suggest that the increase of the water flow is related to the reduction of the contamination, while the increase of the water pressure of the washing system was not enough to reduce the pathogen in the sampled carcasses. The results show operational results since the washing system avoids the trimming of some carcasses, but doesn't eliminate the risk of Salmonella.",

Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the maternal (obstetrical and placental) risk factors and the necropsy findings associated with fetal death, based on data obtained from the Verification of Death Service [Serviço de Verificação de Óbito (SVO)] in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Material and method: This is an observational, cross-sectional study using secondary data. Were included the reports released between 2010 and 2015, with a diagnosis of fetal deaths at gestational age of 20 weeks or more. Results: During the period evaluated, 210 autopsies were performed. From these, 15.2\% (n = 32) presented umbilical cord abnormalities, 22.4\% (n = 47) placental abnormalities, 49.5\%(n = 104) maternal health problem related to pregnancy, and 10\% (n = 21) previous maternal disease. Among the fetal characteristics involved, it was observed that 6.7\% (n = 14) presented meconium aspiration and 5.2\% (n = 11) fetal malformations. In this study, 21.9\%(n = 46) did not have their causa mortis defined. Discussion: The findings of this study show a statistically significant association (p <0.05) between meconium aspiration and full term pregnancy, hospital origin and normal birth weight. Such information is in agreement with the literature, which shows signs of intrauterine hypoxia, such as the presence of meconium, which are more prevalent in full term pregnancy. Conclusion: Among the causes of fetal death, ascending infection was the most prevalent; the maternal death related to pregnancy were the ones that stood out the most.",

As well as physician satisfaction, they are used as quality indicators of the Clinical Analysis Service (CAS). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the time to return a test result, the communication of critical values and the level of satisfaction of the ED physicians of a university hospital with the CAS. Material and methods: A physician satisfaction survey was conducted using a questionnaire. The test turnaround time for emergency requests was analyzed by observation of the pre-analytical phase and monitoring the analytical and post-analytical phases through the laboratory information system. In order to evaluate the communication of critical values by the CAS, a document analysis of the process was performed. Results: Physicians' overall satisfaction with the CAS was considered average. Greater satisfaction was observed with reliability of the results and the staff courtesy and lesser with the delivery time of results. The test turnaround time exceeded clinicians' expectations and the average described in the literature. No experience with critical-value communication was perceived. Conclusion: The results show several opportunities for progress in the relationship between ED and CAS. The improvement of laboratory quality indicators also depends on the involvement of ED physicians and nurses and embraces monitoring, planning, education and investment in system computerization.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Cancer is considered a public health problem and is commonly known because of its high mortality rate worldwide. The histopathological evaluation is a fundamental requirement to determine the nature of the lesion, thus it is considered the gold standard examination for diagnosis of neoplasia. The present study aims to evaluate the histopathological profile of patients with malignant tumors diagnosed at a reference hospital in the Agreste Pernambucano. A cross-sectional, descriptive study of a quantitative documentary survey was conducted using the database of the clinical analysis laboratory of the referred Hospital in the field of pathology in the year 2016. A total of 74 cases were selected, and the male gender was the most affected. The age group of patients with the highest prevalence was between 50 and 70 years of age. Clinical characteristics: The most prevalent anatomical location with tumors was both the colon/rectum (30\%) and skin (30\%). The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (47.2\%). The pathological profile of cancer patients in the region studied were characterized, which served as a database for future epidemiological studies and as a subsidy for the implementation of preventive public policies for the population of this region.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) is used alternatively to the traditional immunohistochemical methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, since it presents high sensitivity and specificity. This type of sample undergoes several chemical modifications during histological processing, and both poor and excessive fixation can impair sample quality, making it difficult to obtain good results. In CISH, it is common to use positive samples as quality control for the reactions; however, this practice does not provide any information regarding the preservation of the genetic material, nor does it avoid false-negative results. Objective: The objective of this study was to validate the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (+) and (-), and ribonucleic acid (RNA) (+) and (-) control probes to be used as quality control for the samples, evaluating preservation of the genetic material. Materials and methods: Twelve histological sections were used (in quadruplicate, n = 48), prepared from a pool of tissues without microscopic changes related to infectious and/or inflammatory processes. The CISH protocol was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions, standardized under the conditions of our laboratory, using commercial DNA and RNA probes chemically linked to digoxigenin. Results and conclusion: Our results were very satisfactory, showing high reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity and analytical specificity, high predictive values for positive and negative assays and with zero ratio of false-positive and false-negative results, allowing the validation of this reaction.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, and epidemiological studies may help understanding its mechanisms. Objective: To carry out a survey of the number of breast cancer cases diagnosed in a period of six years. Methods: The profile of breast cancers diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in Curitiba was compared with the literature, using a retrospective analysis of ductal/special types and lobular breast carcinoma reports issued between 2008 and 2013. Results: Three hundred twenty-seven (91.6\%) cases of ductal/special types carcinoma and 30 (8.4\%) cases of lobular carcinoma were diagnosed, totaling 357 samples. From these cases, 27 (7.5\%) were carcinoma in situ (20 ductal and seven lobular) and 330 (92.4\%) were invasive carcinoma (307 invasive ductal/special types and 23 lobular). The prevalence of breast cancer among women was 991\% and the majority of patients were older than 50 years of age (67.2\%). Regarding the União Internacional de Controle do Câncer/American Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging, 49.2\% of the ductal/special types tumors were diagnosed in Stages I or II, while 56.6\% of lobular carcinomas were diagnosed in Stages II or III/IV. Regarding the Nottingham score, most cases were intermediate grade (43.9\%). A total of 61\% of the tumors were estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and 54\% were progesterone receptor positive (PR+). Moreover, 36.1\% presented positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+), a rate higher than that indicated by the literature. Conclusion: The breast carcinomas evaluated in this study presented a profile similar to that reported in the literature, with some peculiarities inherent to the local pathology service. Nevertheless, the low frequency of in situ cases indicates failure in early diagnosis.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: In Brazil, cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. It reached 5,430 deaths in the year 2013, with estimated 16,370 new cases by 2018. Its occurrence has been associated with previous human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for the development of intraepithelial lesions; however, several factors can influence this appearance, including number of sexual partners and infections by other microorganisms. Objective: The profile of women from the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, with atypia, cervical intraepithelial lesions and cancer, was verified. Material and method: Documentary, analytical, retrospective study, carried out through the collection of information in the database of the State Department of Health of Pernambuco, by TabNet, referring to the tests in the laboratory of the municipality of Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil. Results: During the study period, 18,466 tests were evaluated. From the samples evaluated, 735 (4.31\%) were squamous and glandular atypia, 167 (0.98\%) intraepithelial lesions, and one (0.005\%) cancer. Coccus, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacilli were the most evident agents in cervical alterations. Discussion: Studies demonstrate the intimate relationship between infectious agents and the development of cervical lesions and cancers. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequent agent in the presence of abnormalities was identified as a facilitator of HPV penetration. Conclusion: Women infected by Gardnerella vaginalis and older than 30 years of age are more exposed to the development of alterations. Guidelines on prevention and screening should be continuous strategies in public services. Understanding these risk factors is a paramount concern because they are involved in the prevention and etiology process of cervical lesions and cancer.",

Objective: To evaluate the influence of fixation times on the morphological and staining characteristics of samples fixed in ethanol and stained by the Papanicolaou method. Method: Experimental, quantitative and qualitative research was carried out on 99 samples of the jugal mucosa scrapings from 33 participants, fixed in 96\% ethyl alcohol in three different times. Group A: 15 minutes; group B: 30 minutes; group C: seven days. The quality of staining was categorized in Optimal, Good, Regular and Poor, with subsequent recategorization at optimal and non-optimal. To verify the association among the groups and the categories, Fisher's exact test was performed, with significance level of 0.05. Results: From the 99 stained slides, 19 were discarded due to acellularity, remaining 80 slides. From these, 28 in group A, 26 in group B and 26 in group C were evaluated. In Group A, optimal quality was found in 60.7\% (n = 17), good in 28.6\% (n = 8), regular in 10.7\% (n = 3) and poor in 0\% (n = 0). In group B optimal was found in 61.5\% (n = 16), good in 30.8\% (n = 8), regular in 7.7\% (n = 2) and poor in 0\% (n = 0). In group C, optimal was found in 92.3\% (n = 24), good in 7.7\% (n = 2), regular in 0\% (n = 0) and poor in 0\% (n = 0). In the three groups, there was no representation of the Poor category. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is a significant difference in the staining quality (p-value = 0.01) according to the fixation time.",

Among the obstacles to access basic social rights is the denial of this public's right to health care. Few studies seek to identify the strategies developed by the homeless due to the lack of public services and the barrier to access existing ones. Therefore, we sought to identify and analyze the therapeutic itineraries of this population in a small city. Triangulation of qualitative methods was used to collect research data through participant observations and semi-structured interviews. Seven men and one woman were interviewed, and the data set was analyzed through thematic analysis. The reports highlight the use of social support networks as a central source of health care through self-care, self-medication, use of popular medicine and day-by-day routine adjustments in the streets for health recovery. Such networks are also alternatives to the guarantee to access public services. The denial of the right to health, due to the process of social exclusion to which they are submitted, is evidenced. We emphasize the sharing of an expanded health vision, related to the social determinants of the health-disease process. Given this scenario, it is fundamental that the professional health care sector promote actions to allow the continuous and integral care of the homeless.",

A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out from August to December 2015 with a structured self-administered questionnaire using medical students from a public institution in Curitiba (PR). The sample was composed of 310 academics, with a higher female participation (58.1\%, p = 0.005) and a mean age of 23.3 years. Facebook was used spontaneously and informally for educational purposes three times a week for 68 (21.9\%) students and daily for 188 students (60\%, p < 0.0001). The tools used were documents (84.2\%, p < 0.0001), timeline (55\%), chat (50\%) and events (49\%). These applications were used to verify warnings with representatives, to update schedules, to solve exercises, to do work online and / or to discuss doubts with teachers and classmates regarding their undergraduate degree. Students recognized advantages in sharing information, interaction among people, ease of use, speed and formation of teams. Lack of privacy (34.5\%), distraction and loss of focus (19.7\%), ethical issues (11\%), digital inclusion difficulty (4.2\%), 3.5\%), internet addiction and dependence (1.6\%) and dubious content (1.3\%) were percieved as disadvantages. Patient pictures or films were posted on social media by 13.1\% of the students. Only 2\% of the academics were aware of ethical standards for medical and health web sites. The use of Facebook, created and administered by students, based on their needs, interests and desires, extrapolated the simple incorporation of a social network. It allowed for the creation of a space for communication, interaction, sharing and collaboration that promoted learning. Educational policies for the virtual environment can improve a more reflective, judicious and profound pedagogical use and integration between teachers and students. For the systematized use of the Internet and its networks in this course, proposals could be made for financial investments, teacher and student training, and the establishment of rules for safer and responsible use of the internet.

Bearing this in mind, the system of gamification, a well-accepted one among students, innovates, since the learning process becomes playful and participatory, contributing to the holistic formation of the students. Objectives To describe the accomplishment of a four-round, competitive championship, and to prove the effectiveness of the method as an innovative form of learning. In all, 16 medical students participated in the championship. Methods This was a cross-sectional, observational study, using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The study consists of the application of a teaching and learning method based on the gamification process and the subsequent application of an evaluation questionnaire to the students for critical analysis. Results Student satisfaction with the activity was observed, with the unanimous assertion that the technique used facilitates learning. 87.5\% of the members preferred the application of active methodologies over traditional ones. 81.25\% of the participants asserted the need to integrate methods with playful approaches into their curricular activities. On the other hand, 12.5\% of the students agreed that the applied leisure activity does not corroborate for teamwork and 6.25\% preferred the traditional teaching methods. Conclusion It was demonstrated that the method of gamification develops a propitious environment for the learning process, with substantial student support. The requirement for change in the educational methods used in undergraduate training could also be perceived, as well as support for such changes among students, and hence the need to seek more and more methodologies that support the development of multiple competences and that can use playfulness as an incentive for the learning process.",

The technique also enables communication in the classroom, encouraging students to address critical topics related to the discipline. Concomitantly, the use of Communication and Information Technologies (CIT) in education has become increasingly common, and its relevance as an auxiliary tool in the teaching-learning process in the field of health education is increasingly evident. Objective to analyze the pedagogical intervention process through PI, with the didactic support of CITs, in the discipline of Biochemistry. Methodology The target audience of this qualitative study was students of the graduation course in medicine (n = 30). The methodology includes a brief introduction of the contents, followed by the presentation of multiple choice questions, which were first answered individually by the students. If the number of correct answers was not satisfactory (< 70\%), the students were asked to debate on the topics in small groups. CITs provide an immediate form of sending and analyzing the answers. The method was applied through an electronic questionnaire available through the platform ``Google Forms''. The students' answers were mapped through the immediate analysis by this platform. To evaluate the method, we use a structured data sheet, which was filled out by the students to record their reactions. Results The results of the survey of students' perceptions using this new technology were positive. The percentage of correct answers increased after applying the method, showing the students' learning process in practice.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Medical residency (MR) is a postgraduate course in which learning is based mainly on practice focused on a particular medical specialty. Once the medical student decides to become a specialist, it is important to understand how the selection process works, the number of vacancies available, the steps they need to go through, whether they need to enroll in a preparatory course for the residency, which specialties exist in each service, and the negative and positive aspects of each one, among other inherent aspects. This study aims to identify the knowledge of MR among medical students of the Centro Universitário do Estado do Pará (CESUPA), the main sources of information available on the subject, and their gaps in this knowledge. An observational cross-sectional, exploratory, descriptive, analytical study was carried out with 259 students of the Cesupa medical school. It was observed that 99.6\% of the participants hoped to enroll in a medical residency, with the majority stating that they have low and medium knowledge about the subject (49\% and 42\% respectively). More than 60\% had already done some research on the topic, the Internet being the most used source of information. Only 6.6\% of participants correctly knew the number of mandatory steps in the selection process, and 89.6\% considered it necessary to take a preparatory course. It is concluded there are still gaps in medical students' knowledge about medical residency programs, and this subject should be further explored in the academic environment, through interventions that will broaden students' horizons, enabling them to become more apt and critical when it comes to deciding where to take the MR, and how to prepare for it.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The teaching of acupuncture has gradually been introduced into medical courses in Brazil and worldwide. At Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, the newly reformulated medical course curriculum, introduced in 1994, included the offer of an optative discipline in Traditional Chinese Medicine/Acupuncture to start the following year, and also the creation, in 1997, of a specialization course in Acupuncture for qualified medical doctors. In this article, we present a study that aims to identify major challenges and perspectives in Chinese Medicine teaching for undergraduate and graduate students at the UFF medical school, emphasizing the paradigmatic polarization between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Neurophysiological Acupuncture. We performed a qualitative, ethnographic study involving document analysis, observation of classroom scenarios, and semi-structured interviews with the teacher and students of the selected discipline and course. In order to ensure triangulation of information, we also used the focus group technique, with former undergraduate students. The data treatment and interpretation of this study were anchored in the epistemological discussion of Thomas Kuhn – the concept of paradigms and the incommensurability of scientific theories. The results of this study show that despite the significant paradigmatic differences, medical students and doctors demonstrate interest in and receptivity towards the integrative approach of health-disease processes offered by traditional TCM. The following positive aspects were highlighted: the valorization of dimensions of human sickness hitherto neglected by biomedicine, the building of an integral perspective on the subject, and the good results obtained with acupuncture. The graduate students noted the need to increase integration between theory and practice, and criticized the reductionism in TCM teaching, with the excessive simplification of complex subjects. Two conclusions can be drawn from this study. A double learning pattern was observed: the interest among undergraduate and graduate students in Traditional Chinese Medicine paradigm, due to its specificities and multiple therapeutic approaches and, at the same time, a search for comparisons with the biomedical model. The complementarity between the paradigms of Traditional Chinese Medicine and neurosciences was the most important characteristic of the introduction of teaching on acupuncture at UFF.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The current medical course curricula give students opportunities to gain practical experience with the SUS (Unified Health System) and with the people who use it. This interaction is generally referred to as ``early contact'' with patients. This early contact generates positive and negative feelings in the students. However, few Brazilian papers have addressed this issue. The purpose of this paper is to describe the feelings experienced by medical students of a private institution in the state of São Paulo, at three important times during the course: when they begin new activities with users of the SUS (1styear), during interactions with their local community in Primary Health Care, in the medical outpatient clinic (2nd year), and during the Internship (3rd year). Demographic identification data and data on the student's feelings were collected at the beginning and end of the school year. The latter were classified as having low, medium or high intensity. The feelings investigated were boredom, happiness, benevolence, disillusionment, discouragement, unpreparedness, empathy, hope, helplessness, motivation, perplexity, rage, accomplishment, satisfaction and sadness. A total of 120 students participated in the study. The results indicate a wide range of feelings, with happiness, motivation and satisfaction being the most common positive ones over the three-year period, and discouragement, unpreparedness and boredom the most frequently mentioned negative feelings. There was also a strong intensity of positive feelings, and a reasonable or low intensity of negative feelings, which declined as the year progressed. Benevolence and hope were the least mentioned positive feelings, while perplexity, rage and sadness were the least predominant negative ones. These results do not match the high rate of mental disorders among medical students that is referred to the specialized literature, highlighting a need for further studies in this area, and for an enhancement of the field of practice with users of the Unified Health System during the professional training.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The practice of comprehensive clinical care of the individual is a challenge faced by medical educators, educational institutions, and researchers seeking to contribute to the development of students' educational skills that combine knowledge, skills and attitudes for this model. Objective To evaluate the impact of communication skills training in the practice of the clinical method of comprehensive clinical care, with or without the use of a specific medical record. Methods Forty-six students in the 7th Period of medical school participated in the study. A combination of educational activities was used to facilitate the acquisition of communication skills for comprehensive clinical care, including: a modeling example, followed by individual reflection and discussion, an interactive lecture, and the use of a specific medical appointment for comprehensive clinical care of the individual (RACIP). The study was divided into four Phases: Phase 1 − Pre-training: filming of clinical care in a simulated environment, carried out by the 46 students, using the current medical appointment in the HC-UFMG. Phase 2 − Training: students were divided into three groups: G1: performed an educational activity not related to clinical care; G2 and G3: received communication skills training. Phase 3 − Evaluation: filming of a consultation in a simulated environment, performed by all the groups, with G1 and G3 using RACIP, and G2, the current medical appointment model. Phase 4 − Feedback and learning opportunity for all the groups. The videos of the clinic visits performed by the students, pre- and post-training, were evaluated by a panel consisting of three evaluators, using the AVACIP instrument (evaluation of comprehensive clinical care of the individual). This takes into account five domains: the initial approach to the consultation; the patient's expectations; the patient's perspective of his/her illness; behavior and lifestyle habits; use of complementary propaedeutic and therapeutic alliance. Results The total positive attitude score for each group was higher in Phase 3 than in Phase 1 (p = 0.001), showing that all the strategies promoted an improvement in communication skills, but there were no differences between groups in each phase (p > 0.310). Analyzing the scores by domain, it was observed that G3 performed better than the others. Conclusion The communication skills training and the use of the RACIP improved the students' performance in relation to comprehensive clinical care of the individual.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This article reports on the experience of members of the Academic League of Applied Anatomy, in Portuguese ``Liga de Anatomia Aplicada (LAA)'' of Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Uerj), whether listeners, organizers or advisers. The motivation behind this article consists in the desire to address the importance of academic organizations and their impact on students, considering the recent growth and inauguration of various leagues. The traditional model of education, practiced in the majority of Brazilian, is characterized by a vertical relationship between the teacher and the students. This view partly the creative limitation imposed on the students and on future professionals. Therefore, Academic Leagues are necessary, as a means of improving, students' critical thinking and solidifying a subject that has already been taught in the curricula but that, due to exhausting schedules and rigid time frames, remains abstract and unappealing to the students, resulting in a lack of motivation and disappointed expectations. The league seeks to meet the demands of recently enrolled students, eager to apply in practice subjects still only seen in theory during the basic cycle of school. However, all the activities need to be well organized if they are to achieve their goals. Teachers must ensure supervision, the league's board of directors must be well-selected, and the division of tasks must be effective, in order to ensure the engagement of all the participants. All this work, whether for the production of scientific content, planning of lectures, courses or symposia, directly impacts the thought processes of all those involved. Alongside the whole process described, the basis of all this evolution is the teaching, research and extension activities, which complement the learning; develop research, and contribute to the dissemination of academic knowledge and the fulfillment of social duty. This paper shows the impact that a league has on the formation of medical students and on the constant encouragement for teachers to update their skills. Therefore, statements were collected and questionnaires conducted, to confirm the importance of the League for personal and professional growth in various spheres, and show how these extracurricular activities have proven to be beneficial in enabling students and teachers to acquire new experiences.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The purpose of this research was to evaluate the lifestyle and estimate the prevalence of consumption of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs among medical students of an institution in Maringá, Paraná. It is a cross-sectional, exploratory, descriptive study, with undergraduates from the first to sixth years of medical school. The data collection was carried out from June to August 2017, using a self-administered instrument called the ``Fantastic Lifestyle Checklist'', which is composed of 25 objective questions, that consider the individual's behavior in the last month. The results of the questionnaire are used to determine the association between lifestyle and health. Totalling all the points gives a total score that classifies individuals into one of five categories: ``Excellent'', ``Very Good'', ``Good'', ``Fair'' and ``Needs improvement''. It is desirable for individuals to achieve a ``Good'' rating. The lower the score, the greater the need for change. The exclusion criteria adopted were: students under 18 years old, and those not present on the day of the data collection. Next, the data were transferred to spreadsheet, then analyzed using descriptive statistics. 576 medical students participated in the research, the majority aged between 21 and 25 years old, female, White, single, had studied at a private high school, and living alone. Regarding the parents' level of education, the data showed that 73.61\% of the fathers and 83.68\% of the mothers had studied for 12 or more years. Less than half of the students reported a diagnosis of depression or other chronic mental health condition. Most of the students did not sleep well and did not feel rested. There was a high prevalence of students who are satisfied with their respective jobs or positions. In addition, most reported that they had not smoked in the last year and had never used drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, while 81\% reported an average alcohol intake per week of 0 to 7 units. The predominant classification among the students in the Fantastic Lifestyle Questionnaire was ``Good''. It is therefore concluded that students should be given guidance on how to adopt a healthier lifestyle while engaged in academic activities.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Although not compulsory, medical residency is part through the physicians' teaching and training process. It is considered the gold standard in the teaching modality of Lato Sensu Graduate Programs. However, the number of residency positions available has not kept pace with the expansion of medical undergraduate courses, resulting in high levels of competition for medical residency vacancies, and a proliferation of preparatory courses (PC) offering supervised postgraduate training. The evasion of clerkship students from their academic activities to take prep courses in order to apply for a residency position is a cause for concern among teachers. This study outlines a profile in the São José do Rio Preto (Famerp) School of Medicine internship programme regarding medical interns' adherence to prep courses. The results indicate that the vast majority of the study sample (297 students) intended to apply for a medical residency program. Only 27 (84.4\%) out of the 32 students, despite considering the prep course necessary, did not have the financial resources to attend these courses. The interviewees pointed out that the higher quality of prep courses is due to the didactics of the classes, but that the main disadvantage of these classes is the dissociation between the theoretical and practical content, also experienced during the internship. We conclude that the perceptions of the interns and medical students is well defined in relation to prep courses to get into a medical residency. Although they adhere to the practice of these courses, they know that there is a dichotomy between the theory and the practice that is offered in the internship, and that this hinders their professional training. The vast majority of the study sample intended to apply for the medical residency program after the internship, continuing their studies and learning. On the other hand, the current environment of the job market in the field of medicine, marked by fierce competition and constant requirements to update and improve, is leading students to view the medical residency as the only natural way to continue after the internship. They also see it as a way of making up for any shortfalls of the internship program. Changes in undergraduate courses, such as a better class didactics and the approach to theoretical content during the internship, reflect the deficiency of undergraduate courses and the internship program, but which can be remedied with a more assertive attitude on the part of teachers and preceptors.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Acute pancreatitis is a frequent disease in general hospitals wards; it has a multifactorial etiology and can lead to severe alterations of the various corporeal systems. The internship generally represents the time when medical students consolidate the knowledge they have gradually acquired during the initial stages of their course. Several medical courses are currently undergoing a change in pedagogical focus, with the adoption of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) method in relation to knowledge about acute pancreatitis among medical intern students from a private university in the interior of São Paulo state, compared to the traditional learning method. It is a descriptive and transversal study with a quantitative approach. The sample consisted of 40 sixth-year medicine students of a private higher education institution in São Paulo state, in the second semester of 2015. A comparative evaluation was made between the knowledge about the matter among the study group and the control group. The Student t parametric test was applied to two independent groups, resulting in the finding that the students who participated in the PBL tutorial sessions performed better in the assessment test, with p = 0.013. Hence, in addition to the advantages already known in relation to the preparation of proactive medical professionals, in tune with the feelings of their working environment, their peers and patients, the method is also proven to be efficient in continuing the teaching-learning process during medical internship. It is therefore concluded that this teaching-learning method be employed at the medical school in the study. It is also proposed that the research be continued with resident physicians, to evaluate the acquisition of knowledge of other pathologies and other specialties, comparing PBL to traditional methods in order to achieve greater support for the adoption of the PBL method in this stage of medical training.",

Methods A cross-sectional study with 431 students in their first to fourth years of Medical School, through the application of the Liebowitz Social anxiety scale (LSAS-SR), Beck's anxiety Inventory, and a questionnaire with questions concerning sociodemographic issues, family history of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric appointments, level of anxiety when expressing themselves in tutorials, and the perception of how their anxiety varied throughout the college semesters. Results Using the LSAS-SR as a screening tool for cases of SAD, there were indications of the disorder in 59.2\% (255) of the students. In relation to the level of anxiety, the Beck's anxiety inventory (BAI) showed that 59.3\% (258) of the students presented minimal anxiety, 26.6\% (115) presented light anxiety, 9.7\% (42) presented moderate anxiety, and 4.4\% (19) presented severe anxiety. A significant correlation was observed between the scores obtained in the BAI and LSAS-SR scales: students with symptoms suggesting social anxiety showed a greater degree of anxiety. Also, students with symptoms of social anxiety reported higher levels of anxiety when expressing themselves during tutorials. Conclusions The high prevalence of SAD pointed out in this research justifies stimulating the adoption of psycho-educational measures and pedagogical strategies that will help students with the manifestations of social anxiety, reduce these symptoms, and promote the teaching-learning process.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The rising number of students leagues in the Escola Paulista de Medicina of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (EPM–Unifesp) leads to questions about their meaning to students and their role in medical training, as well as concerns about learning distortions, early specialization, social relevance, and insertion in the Brazilian national health system, called the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). In order to try and clarify these questions, this qualitative study analyzes the statues of the leagues, and the statements of tutors and students, gathered by means of four focal groups with students and two interviews with the tutors. We found 45 leagues currently running at the EPM–Unifesp, most of them associated with a medical specialty. The main motivators for joining in a league were: the search for practical activities, the desire to gain more experience of a particular specialty, the desire for more knowledge, and the need to be recognized as a responsible adult. Of the leagues studied, few conducted research or university extension activities, focusing on treatment and theoretical classes, supervised by professors, non-teacher physicians, resident doctors, or more senior students. The tutors are in charge of the organizational aspects. The leagues can reproduce graduation models, such as an overburdoning with activities and poor expository classes. Concerning insertion in the SUS, the leagues could be a means of training future SUS professionals. Although students claim that they intend to specialize in the league's field, the tutors disagree that they lead to early specialization. We consider that while leagues fill gaps in the learning and expectations of the course, they are limited in regards to the impact of their activities on medical training and their social relevance. They can subvert the curricular structure and favor early specialization. We recommend that universities pay closer attention to students leagues, observing their number, selection process, activities, tutors involved and explicit objectives, with the purpose of evaluating their roles in the curriculum and medical training.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Curricular fragmentation, and the separation between the various dimensions of medical education, have led to a debate on the need for strategies to promote a closer alignment between what is taught on undergraduate courses in Medicine and the actual day-to-day work of health professionals in their fields of work. Various proposals for updating the curriculum are currently being discussed in medical schools and other sectors involved with vocational training. The aim of this study is to describe the experiences and contributions of actions carried out during the development of two disciplinary areas of the Bachelor of Medicine Course at Universidade Estadual de Ciências da Saúde de Alagoas (Uncisal). These proposals are focused on promoting articulation between teaching, service, and the community, giving first year students of the course practical experience of various scenarios of the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS). In terms of methodology, this work is a ``Report of Experience''. For its construction, it uses the reflections of the authors-participants of the disciplines on their experiences. Using the foundations of Collective Health and Human and Social Sciences, the pedagogical experiences and learning methods provided enabled the students to understand, in practice, how the Unified Health System works, and its political and administrative dimensions, as well as reflecting on the concepts of health-disease based on their practical experiences in the community. These activities have shaped highly enriching experiences and privileged spaces of academic and formation of citizens for the future of professional practice in medicine. They also provide effective tools for the application of the recommendations of the National Curricular Guidelines for medical education that is aligned with the needs of the community and of the SUS.",

The scope of this article is to conduct a critical analysis of the evolution of the ethical norms proposed by FMC for the use of ART in Brazil. A documentary analysis of the text of the four published Resolutions was carried out, in which the ethical standards for the use of ART were described. It was observed that the resolution evolved in relation to the rights of homosexuals, adopted more permissive measures regarding cryopreservation, donation of gametes and embryos and uteruses on loan and lastly authorized some procedures in ART such as postmortem reproduction, donation and shared gestation. From 2013 onwards the resolution gained a liberal character being updated in terms of clinical practice. For the next updates it would be interesting to include procedures in ART not previously addressed such as nuclear and cytoplasmic transfer. The update frequency (every two years) should be kept to the ethical standards enabling the ART to continue evolving together with the advancement of science.",

We rely on a ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews undertaken in a female ward of a public hospital in order to analyze certain aspects of these relationships, based on hermeneutics and science studies. The empiric observation showed that Doctors organized their practice and clinical decisions on certain abstractions and dialogued in a structured, highly specialized and restricted language. Nurses materialized medical decisions, guided by the prescriptions. They had no room to interfere in clinical decisions, being very busy with their tasks and not dominating the clinical discourse, which is crucial for discussing the decisions. In the context of this study, physicians and nurses maintained a distance established by the theory, technique and values shared by each professional group. Thus, we suggest that knowledge, practices and medical values and nurses were incommensurate with each other, and that this directly affected the health care actions performed in that setting.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This article adresses impious and seditious discourses that circulated in Portugal during the 1790s. Going beyond the textual corpus of forbidden books which is considered classic nowadays, the article aims to further the understanding of writings that have been framed as constitutive of political sedition universe. In order to do it, two specific cases were selected: the first one concerns the publication of the book Medicina Theologica, by Caetano Dragazzi; the second one refers to the manuscripts written by Joaquim José Pedro da Veiga. Both were arrested and considered seditious because of their ideas on religion. Even though few scholars have paid attention to them, these two cases reveal not only the fears of the royal authorities about certain discourses, but also some of the debates and concerns that characterized the Lusitanic reality at the end of the eighteenth century.",

 author = "Haddad, Christian",
 abstract = "Abstract This paper analyzes an emerging form of post-pharmaceutical health and its underlying regime of value in the global bioeconomy of regenerative stem cell-based medicine (RSCM). Animated by a vision to overcome drug-based therapies and their underlying political economies, RSCM pursues a form of regenerative health that is strikingly at odds with pharmaceutical regimes of drug research, regulation and therapy. To offer a theoretical account of these competing forms of health, the paper provides an analysis of the regimes of values that underpin pharmaceutical and regenerative health respectively. This analysis is done alongside three dimensions: the interlinkage between knowledge, technology and economic value creation; its relation to normative values and ethics; and conceptions and valuations of the biomedical subject and his/her body in biomedical research, intervention and innovation. Contrasting these two diverging regimes of health and value suggests that in RSCM the pharmaceutical logic of accumulating ``surplus health'' is not entirely dismissed but re-articulated in a regime based on the (re-)generation of regenerative biovalue through the extraction and ex vivo accumulation of ``surplus vitality''. Finally, the article discusses ``post-pharmaceutical health'' as a sensitizing concept that offers new research avenues into emergent forms of health, value, and subjectivity beyond RSCM.",

 author = "Bortz, Gabriela and Rosemann, Achim and Vasen, Federico",
 abstract = "Abstract This paper aims to analyze innovation pathways for stem cell technology in Argentina. Firstly, we present a theoretical perspective on the co-construction of regulation and technology development, positing four main tensions that underlie regulatory building and the shaping of national strategies for regenerative medicine. Regulation is understood as a negotiated process among interests, values, benefits, rewards, and different understandings of safety, efficacy, access and availability. The framework is useful to explore how actors and their visions of desired futures shape the creation of standards and, in turn, how they configure the way these emerging technologies are produced, accessed and used. Secondly, we discuss in detail the Argentine case. We focus on (a) the deployment of state actions on capacity and regulatory building, (b) the creation of new businesses in response to patient expectations, particularly umbilical cord stem cell banks and the supply of experimental treatments, and (c) state-led actions to build a specific regulatory framework (still in the making). Ambiguities and gaps in the current legislation as well as scarce enforcement capabilities configure a legal ``grey area'' for for-profit experimental treatments. Building a specific regulatory framework is understood to be a part of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) state agencies' struggle to govern technology development in terms of national envisaged innovation strategies. Lastly, we show how STI authorities and scientists managed to align a broad coalition of actors that encourage international harmonization strategies, following the pharmaceutical model of drug evaluation based on the multi-phase trial system.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Cervicovaginal atrophy is a condition that can affect women after menopause, and cytology is a diagnostic tool useful in such cases. Objective: To evaluate the cytomorphological profile of cervical smears in patients over 60 years old. Methods: Cytopathological examinations of 500 patients over 60 years old were selected consecutively in this cross-sectional, quantitative, retrospective study. Results: Only 114 (22.8\%) presented the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) sampled, and their presence decreased progressively with advancing age (p < 0.001). Most smears (95.6\%) were classified as atrophic. Microbiological analysis showed that from the 22 non-atrophic smears, most presented lactobacillus flora. Among the atrophic swabs, the predominant flora was cocci, with 47.2\%. Only 4\% presented cytological changes: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [(ASC-US) - eight cases/40\%], atypical squamous cells - cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [(ASC-H) - five cases/25\%], high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [(HSIL) - three/15\%], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [(LSIL) - two cases/10\%] and adenocarcinoma in situ [(ACI) - two cases/10\%]. Among the modified smears, four (20\%) presented SCJ cells, and four patients (20\%) took hormones (from these, two cases of ASC-H (10\%) and two cases ASC-US (10\%), showing a relationship between the onset of the lesion and the use of hormones (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The absence of SCJ indicates a diagnostic limitation of sample collection. Although the frequency of lesions has been similar to other studies, and the recommended age range for the examination is between 25 and 60 years, it is important to note that many women older than this range should perform the collection of oncology cytology due to existence of elderly women with risk profile for the disease.",

There were no rare alleles or loss of alleles over the period. The observed heterozygosity was higher in larvae compared to fingerlings. There was a deviation in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in most loci in both groups. The inbreeding coefficient was positive in both groups, with the average of the fingerlings superior to the larvae. The excess heterozygotes were significant in the Stepwise Mutation Model for the fingerlings, indicating the possibility of a recent bottleneck effect. Despite the adequate genetic variability found, the values of the inbreeding coefficient and the possibility of bottleneck effect in the fingerlings show the need for constant genetic monitoring of these stocks prior to release into the environment.",

A previous experiment was conducted using lambs housed in metabolic cages, generating an equation for estimation of herbage intake as a function of faecal crude protein excretion (CPf). The equation presented a value of R 2 = 0.91. In the grazing experiment, the herbage intake was evaluated using missioneira gigante pastures with two pre-grazing sward heights (25 or 35cm), with or without access to peanut areas during two hours per day. The pre-grazing sward height of missioneira gigante did not change the total OM herbage intake, but the access to peanut pastures increased the herbage intake by approximately 20\%. In conclusion, missioneira gigante grass has shown flexibility to be used with pre-grazing sward heights between 25 and 35cm, while the access to forage peanut pastures during two hours daily increases herbage OM intake by lambs grazing grass.",

Objective: This study aims to identify the clinical and histopathological characteristics of oral cavity lipomas subjected to histopathological analysis at a pathology laboratory in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Methods: Data from all cases of oral lesions diagnosed as lipoma and confirmed by histopathological examination over a period of 10 years were collected, including: gender, age, anatomical location, clinical diagnosis and histopathological subtypes. Results: During the period evaluated, 101 cases were diagnosed as lipomas, representing 1.01\% of oral cavity biopsies. Females were more affected, with a male/female ratio of 1: 1.8, and with a peak of incidence between 50 and 70 years of age. The buccal mucosa was the most affected anatomical region, followed by the lower lip. Classic lipoma and fibrolipoma were the histological variants of lipoma most commonly found in the oral cavity, with 64 cases of classic lipoma and 29 cases of fibrolipoma. Other histological variants were: sialolipoma, angiolipoma, chondrolipoma, myxolipoma and intramuscular lipoma. Conclusion: Lipomas are uncommon lesions in the oral cavity, which present a higher prevalence in the buccal mucosa of adults, aged between 50 and 70 years, and with higher female preference.",

The data demonstrated that the technique was efficient for the authentication of Salmo salar, since the species was detected in both the experimentally prepared sushi samples and the isolated fish aliquots used for the preparation of sushi. In contrast, the species Salmo trutta was not detected in the sushi samples prepared with this species nor in the isolated fish aliquots.

Therefore, it was concluded that the technique was able to amplify the DNA of this species and did not generate nonspecific identification when the species Salmo trutta was analyzed, being able to be a suitable tool for the authentication of Salmo salar.",

For that, 20 pigs were used, divided into two groups. All patients underwent radical cystectomy and then the cutaneous or colonic ureterostomies. The technical feasibility was assessed during the procedures. The procedures compared were: the incision size, dieresis time, realization of urinary diversion and the synthesis time. Also, the estimated blood loss and the degree of difficulty in performing the preparation procedures of the ureters, ureteroanastomose site preparation and ureteroanastomose itself were compared. The results indicate that performing cutaneous ureterostomy was better than the colonic ureterostomy in relation to blood loss, incision size, and anastomosis performance. In contrast, ureterocolonostomy showed better results on the implementation of ureteral preparation. Thus, it was concluded that both techniques can be indicated as viable urinary diversions and the choice will depend on factors intrinsic to the surgeon and the patient.",

Tumours were diagnosed according to the WHO criteria for canine skin neoplasms. For the immunohistochemical characterization, the primary monoclonal antibodies anti-cytokeratin 14 (CK14), vimentin, p63, calponin, EGFR and Ki-67 were used. Males were 66.67\% (18/27) and females 33.33\% (9/27), 21 had a defined race and 6 were mixed breed, with ages varying from 7 to 15 years. The tumors characterized were 40.74\% hepatoid (11/27), 29.63\% sebaceous (8/27), 25.92\% apocrine (7/27) and 3.70\% Meibômio (1/27). Malignant tumors accounted for 55.56\% and benign tumors 44.44\%. With these results it was possible to demonstrate that tumors of cutaneous glands in dogs are frequent, with no predilection for race, sex and with an age ≥ seven years. The CK 14 antibodies, p63, vimentin, and EGFR were imunoexpressed in the basal cells of the sebaceous cell differentiation and Meibomian hepatoides tumors and myoepithelial to cells. However, vimentin and EGFR did not demonstrate immunostaining for sebaceous tumors. Calponin was a good marker for myoepithelial cells.

Total reticulocyte absolute counts were determined by automated fluorescence flow cytometry and manual methods in 40 blood samples obtained from anemic cats. The manual count was obtained by supravital stain in duplicate to each sample and the reticulocyte morphology were discriminated between punctate and aggregates reticulocytes. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was utilized to compare the methods. Most samples were from anemic cat (15,25\%) and the hematocrit mean was 17,81\%. Regression analysis showed that the correlation between the absolute total automatic counts is higher with aggregated reticulocytes (rho= 0,71; P< 0,001) than with absolute punctate reticulocytes counts (rho= 0, 68, P< 0.001). Results suggest that the ProCyte Dx reticulocytes count in anemic cats is correlated with aggregate reticulocyte count. Thus, the greater amount of RNA and organelles in aggregate reticulocytes generates a cellular complexity and, therefore, greater impregnation of the dye in an automatic count. Thus, the values obtained by the hematologic instrument can be used for the immediate evaluation of the hematological condition in anemic cats.",

This is a rare phenomenon, estimated between 1:50,000 and 1:200,000 births. The objective of this report is to present the anesthetic management and the perioperative challenges for a separation surgery. Case report: Thoraco-omphalopagus twins were diagnosed by ultrasound and were followed by the fetal medicine team of the service. After 11 h of cesarean surgery, the pediatric surgical team chose to separate the twins. They were monitored with cardioscopy, oximetry, capnography, nasopharyngeal thermometer, urinary output, and non-invasive blood pressure. We chose inhaled induction with oxygen and 4\% Sevoflurane. T1 patient was intubated with a 3.5 uncuffed endotracheal tube, and, after three unsuccessful intubation attempts of patient T2, a number 1 laryngeal mask was used. After securing the twins' airway, the induction was supplemented with fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium. Mechanical ventilation in controlled pressure mode (6 mL.kg−1) and lumbar epidural (L1-L2) with 0.2\% ropivacaine (2.5 mg.kg−1) were used. The pediatric surgical team initiated the separation of the twins via sternotomy, ligation of hepatic vessels. After 2 hours of procedure, the separation was completed, continuing the surgical treatment of T1 and the support of T2 until his death. Conclusions: Conjoined twin separation surgery is a challenge, which requires planning and coordination of a multidisciplinary team during all stages.",

A total of 67 K. pneumoniae isolates from different domestic (39/67) and wild (28/67) isolation sites were confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The highest percentage of K. pneumoniae isolation was from urine samples with 16\% (11/67), faeces 15\% (10/67) and lung 13.5\% (09/67). In the resistance profile, 11 categories of antibiotics were tested, with the highest resistance to metronidazole being 97\% (65/67), ampicillin 94\% (63/67), amoxicillin 93\% (62/67), sulfonamides 93\% (62 / 67), 93\% colistin (62/67), and 88\% nitrofurantoin (59/67). The ones with the lowest resistance were: meropenem 3\% (2/67), imipenem 6\% (4/67) and amikacin 16\% (11/67). All isolates were considered multiresistant bacteria (MDR), with the Multiple Resistance to Antibiotics Index (IRMA) ranging from 0.15 to 0.85 and with 60 types of resistance patterns. The result of this study reinforces that the animals are reservoirs of multiresistant K. pneumoniae.",

The study aimed to evaluate the fibrinolytic protease production and integrated extraction from Mucor subtilissimus UCP 1262 by extractive fermentation using Aqueous Two-Phase Systems (ATPS). The integrated process was carried out to assess the production, partition and fibrinolytic enzyme recovery, according to a 2 3 -experimental design, using as independent variables Polyethylene glycol (PEG) molar mass, PEG and sodium sulphate concentration, concentration. The highest fibrinolytic activity (15.40U/mL) was obtained in sodium sulfate rich phase in the assay comprising of 10\% of salt and 18\% of PEG 8000 (g/mol). Yield greater than 80\% was obtained. The fibrinolytic protease presented optimum pH 7.0 and stability between pH 6.0 and 8.5, and optimum temperature 50°C, stable between 10°C to 50°C. The enzyme was classified as a serine-protease with 52kDa of molecular weight. As a result, the process is remarkably effective to pre-purify the fibrinolytic protease with a low cost and significantly faster processing time. When compared to other isolated production and purification techniques the extractive fermentation is worthy of being a candidate to replace the initial stages of conventional separation processes.",

He has defended the teaching laicization and became one of the references for the Portuguese educational reformation provided by Marquis of Pombal. In addition to proposing institutional and curricular changes in order to organize the educational system controlled by the State, he fulfilled a meaningful reflection about the scholar discipline and, within his commentaries, it is possible to identify a concern with the control of the body and emotions. Education, in the author's perspective, plays a crucial role in absorbing the essential ``virtues'' of life within a society. By presenting the educational procedures which would infuse these ``virtues'', Ribeiro Sanches outlines a set of self-controlled strategies thought as vital to the social order and public business.",

However, the use and correct implementation of these new methods still present real challenges. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the perceptions and opinions of teachers and students regarding the effectiveness of the teaching methods used on the Universidade do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte (UERN) medical course. For this purpose, an exploratory descriptive study was carried out, with a transversal character. Data collection was carried out from July 2015 to June 2016. A total of 140 students (82.5\% of the medical course students) and 80 teachers (55\% of the faculty) were interviewed. The subjects were of both sexes, and from all periods and curricular components of the course. After reading and signing a consent form, the participants were interviewed, with objective and subjective questions that sought to obtain their sociodemographic data, and their opinions and perceptions of the teaching-learning methods used by the teaching staff. The results were submitted to descriptive statistics and Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's Exact, using the PEPI and PAST software, and considering values of p ≤ 0.05 as significant. The interviewees' opinions and suggestions were represented in the form of a word cloud, using WordArt software. Traditional methods were the most frequently used techniques (76.0\% of teachers), and were considered more effective than contemporary methods by both the teachers (78.0\%) and the students (92.0\%). However, a high proportion of the interviewees (75.0\% of the teachers and 73.6\% of the students) said that they would like to use and experience other didactic-pedagogical methods as a way to improve learning. It was also observed that length of teaching experience, and whether or not the teacher held a postgraduation qualification, were significantly associated with the use of more contemporary teaching-learning methods. It is therefore concluded that lack of teaching experience and experience with other teaching methodologies, together with the strenuous workload of the course, can pose hindrances to the implementation and acceptance of more contemporary methodologies. We note the urgent need to promote didactic-pedagogical training for the teaching staff, as well as the implementation of the Pedagogical Project of the Course, in order to promote the development of student-centered methodologies, in line with current teaching recommendations for courses in the area of health, especially Medicine.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to present the structure of a curricular unit for the discussion of gender and sexuality, as well as the initial results of the implementation of this discussion in a medical course of a Brazilian Federal University. The Context / Input / Process / Product (CIPP) model for program evaluation was used to present the structure of this curricular unit, and the heterogeneity of the steps and paths taken for its realization (steps 1, 2 and 3 of the CIPP). It also presents the initial results of the implementation of this discussion on a medical course (Step 4 of the CIPP). In stage 1, a document analysis of the curriculum of the medical school under study was carried out; Stages 2 and 3 give a descriptive narrative of the process of planning and implementing the curricular unit, based on the Paulino \& Raimondi Arch for the Teaching-Learning of Public Policies in interface with Care for Health Degrees Programs; In step 4, a retrospective pre-post questionnaire was filled out voluntarily, in the end of the intervention, to the students. It consisted of closed questions, using a 7-point Likert scale to assess the students' perceptions about the improvement of their competences in the areas of gender and sexuality in health care, following this pedagogical experience. This step also included a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, using the student's t-test, the effect size calculation (Cohen's d), and the general linear model of mixed design, to determine whether there is significant difference between the genders before and after the intervention of each of the questions. The results show that the intervention/curricular unit developed, through the Paulino \& Raimondi Arch, was statistically significant, having a significant impact on the improvement of competences, from the students' perspective, in relation to this theme. This impact was most evident in female gender. It is concluded that this pedagogical strategy proved to be powerful in education for the health professions, promoting integrality in health care regarding gender and sexuality issues, through the improvement of competences related to those issues, thereby promoting the principles of the Unified Health System (SUS – Sistema Único de Saúde), social justice, and human rights.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Breastfeeding has become a global priority due to its numerous benefits to children's health, their mothers and society. Breastfeeding rates around the world have been below the desired, therefore, the institutions involved have a social responsibility to prepare medical professionals to teach about, and promote breastfeeding in their medical courses. This study seeks to identify the progress of knowledge about breastfeeding in a medical course, using quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional approaches. It consisted of the application of a questionnaire on breastfeeding that was applied to all students enrolled in the medical course of a University in Alagoas. We excluded from the sample students in the 1st and 12th semesters who participated in the semantic validation, using the instrument, ``Encuesta sobre Conocimientos en Lactancia'' (ECoLa), originally in Spanish but submitted to a process of semantic validation and made available in full through electronic media. Next, a documentary analysis of the medical course (PPC, subject syllabi, course plans) was carried out, where the theme was inserted. Content regarding the topic of breastfeeding was found in the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 10th periods of the course. The questionnaire gathered information about the students' knowledge of physiology, public health, feeding in the early days, late problems, assessment of breastfeeding, maternal condition, and prevailing attitudes. As a result of the questionnaire, it was observed that in the first three periods of the course, the success rates remained stable (45.61\% – 39.04\% – 41.13\%), and there were no significant differences between them (p> 0.05). The progression from one period to another was significant between the 3rd (41.13\%) and the 4th (61.13\%) periods, with a success rate increase of 20\%. In the other periods, from the 4th to the 12th periods, there was little variation in the indices and no significant differences between them (p> 0.05). Looking at each area of knowledge covered by this study, it is known that there is still much to do be done to promote teaching about breastfeeding among medical students. Several innovative methodologies can favor learning among health professionals. It is suggested that the topic be addressed throughout the course, from the 1st to the last periods, with gradually increasing complexity, so that graduates can contribute to increasing the rate of breastfeeding in the communities where they will later practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Choosing a medical specialty is extremely important for medical students as it represents the choice of their day-to-day practice. While this choice is influenced by academic achievement, financial considerations and lifestyle preferences, intrapersonal aspects also have an impact on the decision. Objectives To evaluate the main factors that influence medical students in their choice of medical specialty, and to identify the areas of practice preferred by students in the first four years of a Higher Education Institution. Results Out of a total of 397 students, 307 answered a questionnaire previously prepared for this study, and of these, 291 were considered valid. 204 female, and 87 male. Influencing factors were compared among students from different years, and with results published in the literature. The main factors considered by the students in this decision were: broader or specific knowledge, contact with the patient, place of professional activity, and lifestyle after medical residency. For the women, the factors day-to-day stress of the specialty, the long-term relationship with the patient, and the ease of finding a job were significantly more relevant in the choice of specialty than for the men. Parents who were doctors also influenced the choice of specialty. The student's financial profile influenced the choice when related to long-term financial returns, being more relevant for students with monthly family incomes at the higher or lower ends of spectrum, i.e., - between 6 and 15 thousand Brazilian reals, or more than 20 thousand Brazilian reals. The specialty General Surgery was the first choice , predominantly among the male students, followed by Pediatrics, Clinical Medicine and Psychiatry. Conclusions Lifestyle, place of professional activity and early financial returns were considered equally important by students across all the years evaluated. Due to the large number of variables evaluated, and the many factors that influence this decision, additional studies are needed, in order to make more significant comparisons with the literature.",

This study aimed to analyze the perception of teachers of the medical course of a Public University of Ceará on the challenges of medical training in Collective Health. This is a case study with a qualitative approach, based on the focus group technique. A focus group session was held with four professors from the disciplines of the Collective Health area, the qualitative material being organized into categories and processed through the Thematic Analysis. After analysis emerged the categories: students' preconceptions about collective health; infrastructure and preparation for use of active methodologies; dialogue among the teachers of the disciplines of the collective health axis; interlocution between medical theory and practice; active role of the learner in learning; interdisciplinarity. The teachers pointed out the prejudice at the beginning of the course, and the new didactic-pedagogical strategies, based on active methodologies, are fundamental and more attractive and appropriate to the current social context, stimulating the search for knowledge, and improving the student-teacher relationship. In addition, they recognized the existence of specific factors of the medical course that hinder the applicability of didactic-pedagogical strategies: fragility of the pedagogical formation of a large part of the teaching staff for the teaching exercise, due to the inexistence of a Permanent Education Policy and the structure physics. It ratifies the importance of the disciplines of the Collective Health for the training of the doctor in this area with regard to the competencies proposed in the light of the 2014 DCN, corroborating to the physician's action and to his organization as part of a health team . Thus, it is evident that, in order to qualify the medical training, inexorably, one cannot do without the insertion of Collective Health in the Curricular Matrix of the Course. For this to occur, it becomes imperative that the theoretical content be linked to the current social and technological context, based on active learning methodologies.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Students' perspectives, disappointments and achievements significantly affect their learning process and the way they perceive the profession. This study evaluates the relationship between the New National Curricular Guidelines for Medicine Courses, implemented in 2014, and the expectations of first year students of a Medicine course of a private Higher Education Institution in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, regarding their medical training. The study was carried out using quantitative and qualitative methods, based on the application of questionnaires that addressed aspects such as the student's profile, initial motivations and expectations of their academic training, futures plans and projects in relation to the profession, and knowledge about The National Curricular Guidelines for the Medicine Course. The results for the profile of these students indicated a predominance of female students, from the interior of the state of Minas Gerais, in the 18 to 20 year age group, who entered the institution through the vestibular exam having previously taken the National Secondary Education Examination (ENEM). The main motivations for choosing medicine as an undergraduate course included personal and vocational skills, and the opportunity for personal fulfillment. The expectations of the academic training included working in a hospital context during the initial years of the course, and the desire to practice at different levels of health care, promoting recovery and rehabilitation. The postgraduation projects of the students included medical residency, professional competence, work-life balance, and becoming medical specialists/subspecialists. In terms of overall vision, the students declared that they were satisfied with their graduation course, pointing out just a few areas where the learning/teaching process was lacking. The majority of students in the first period (56\%) were unfamiliar with the DCNs of 2001 and 2014, and the majority of the students in the second period (54.8\%) reported knowing only the 2014 guidelines, with the college being indicated as the main source of information on the new DCNs. The students' expectations were, on the whole, in line with the principles, fundamentals and purposes of the medical training provided for in the new DCNs of the course in terms of the main competences and general abilities of the medical training, such as Integral Health Care, Health Education, and Health Management, as well as on the new dimensions addressed in these guidelines. However, some points of disagreement were observed, such as the lack of intention to become general practitioners or to focus their training on primary care, which is recommended in the guidelines; the intention to take care of their own mental health, also recommended in the new guidelines; and a certain resistance to the inclusion of new disciplines and new active learning methodologies as opposed to valuing traditional teaching methods.",

Objective To evaluate the level of understanding among medical interns about the living will and end-of-life decisions. Methods This was a quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted with 147 medical students taking their internship, through a questionnaire composed of 10 questions. These questions enabled us to evaluate the students' level of knowledge about the living will, and to verify their personal opinions on how far the content of this document should be respected, and to ask whether they had had an opportunity to discuss the living will during their undergraduate studies. The students' knowledge of the living will was categorized into three groups: ``clear understanding'', ``partial notion,'' and ``misconception or misunderstanding of the term.'' Results Among the interns interviewed, only 12.9\% had a clear understanding of the meaning of the term ``living will'', while 74.2\% had a partial notion of the term and 12.2\% had a misconception of the term. Nonetheless, 96.6\% of the students reported that this topic was discussed during their graduate studies, and 87.1\% reported knowledge of Federal Medical Council Resolution no. 1995 of 2012. Most of the students (98\%) stated that in the case of a terminally ill patient with a living will, they would comply with the provisions of this document. Conclusion Although many of the students had some knowledge of the term ``living will'', only a small portion of them had a clear understanding of its meaning. Despite this, their attitudes towards a patient with a living will were clearly positive, demonstrating good acceptance of the living will among future physicians.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Changes are occurring in health teaching and professional training, due to the introduction of active methodologies to the teaching-learning process in Brazilian higher education institutions. These active learning methodologies, such as PBL (Problem-Based Learning), are used to help medical students acquire knowledge in a more relevant way, compared to traditional teaching. Medical education in Brazil has been the subject of much discussion, and has undergone significant changes in recent years. The objective of the present work is to report the teaching experience in the curricular components Mechanisms of Aggression and Defense I (MAD I) and Mechanisms of Aggression and Defense II (MAD II) of Universidade do Estado da Bahia [State University of Bahia] - Campus I in undergraduate teaching in Medicine. These subjects are composed of the disciplines microbiology, parasitology, immunology (MAD I and II) and pathology (MAD II), taught in an integrated way. Active teaching methodologies were applied, such as problem-based learning, laboratory activities, scientific presentations and the use of film. In addition, the MOODLE tool was used in the virtual campus. This proposal began in 2012 and has been applied since then. The experience of the MADs, with the use of different forms of teaching methodologies, has led to a transformation of traditional teaching, leading students to develop their skills and competencies and build knowledge. These new teaching alternatives allow for a broader interaction between the students and the teacher and led us to reflect and advance in the evaluation process, which has been carried out in a broad and procedural way. Moreover, a positive impact on the students' training was observed. As for the processes of teaching, learning and evaluation, new pedagogical proposals should be introduced, prioritizing the formative and developmental character of students so that the necessary competences can be built into the profile established by the National Curricular Guidelines (DCNs) of the Undergraduate Medicine course and other courses in the area of health.",

With these new educational environments, new challenges have arisen, and the need to adapt. Among the components that influence the learning process, this study seeks to understand the students' perceptions of a new undergraduate course in Medicine in terms of its infrastructure, faculty and tutorials, its informal curriculum, composed of academic groups organized by the students and its didactic and pedagogical organization. Our research involved a questionnaire with 31 items, with response options on a Likert scale, which was applied to 208 students enrolled in the second to eighth periods. We divided the students into two groups: one composed of students in the fifth to eighth periods (G2), who had transitioned from a mixed teaching methodology, with traditional aspects and some active disciplines, to an active methodology; and a second group composed of students in the second to the fourth periods (G1), who had begun using active methodologies right from the start of their course. The students evaluated 41.9\% of the items questioned as satisfactory and 19.3\% as unsatisfactory. The items that were deemed most satisfactory were related to interdisciplinary contents and approach, recommended bibliography, use of active methodologies, integration with the community, teaching practices, teacher qualification and didactic equipment. The main points of disagreement between the groups related to didactic and pedagogical aspects, such as the articulation of theory and practice, interdisciplinary contents, curricular flexibility, relevance of the contents, integration with the community and practical activities. The issues that received most criticism form the students were related to the teacher-to-student ratio, teaching practices in the more advanced periods, library components and psychological and pedagogical support. In general, we can see that despite the many difficulties encountered, in the context of a new course, there were more positives than negatives that influenced learning. Nevertheless, the program needs some restructuring to ensure the best experience in the teaching-learning process.",

Three medical education experts were invited to review the documents relating to the course pedagogical projects (CPP) and to complete an evaluation instrument developed to evaluate adherence to the previously published ten-dimensional DCN 2001. The score calculated from the instrument classifies the schools in relation to the degree of adherence to the DCN, with scores ranging from 0 ≤ to 20\%, from 20 to ≤ 40\%; 40 to ≤ to 60\%; from 60 to ≤ to 80\% and from > 80\% considered respectively, divergent, poorly adherent, regular adherence, adherent moderately and strongly adherent. Content analysis of PPPs was also conducted to search for evidence on domains in the text. The total scores of 47.5\% (Institution of Higher Education 1) and 82.5\% (Institution of Higher Education 2), showed regular adherence of the PPC of Institution of Higher Education 1 and marked of the CPP of Institution of Higher Education 2 to DCN 2001. These differences were manifested especially in the dimensions of the adequacy of the teaching methodology to the course design, of the interrelationship of the disciplines in the conception and execution of the curriculum and in the existence of integrating modules or themes. The CPP analyzes showed that, in general, there is adherence to the DCN in different stages. We observed a good reliability of this instrument used in the analysis of the three evaluators for both institutions of higher education (Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 for Institution of Higher Education 1 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.75 for the Institution of Higher Education 2). The comparison of the means of the scores of the evaluators by size was submitted to a significance analysis with the Student t Test. It is concluded that the two schools, in intensity and in different ways and respecting the institutional culture, gradually incorporated the framework of the national curricular guidelines.",

This cross-sectional study included 300 students, tutors, preceptors, teachers and graduation coordinators from seven courses. A Likert-type instrument was constructed and validated with the following dimensions: D1: curricular restructuring and the principles of Propet-Saúde and D2: the pedagogical project of the Propet-Saúde course. The instrument was validated considering semantic, cultural and conceptual equivalence, assignment of points (from 1 to 4), and randomization of the assertions tested. The score generated three interpretive intervals: from 1 to 1.99 (dissatisfaction); 2 to 2.99 (relative satisfaction) and 3 to 4 (satisfaction). The instrument was applied following a pre-test and the placement of the contributors. The instrument was then statistically validated for dispersion and reliability. Factorial analysis was performed considering function and course. Dispersion through linear correlation showed a loss of 4 assertions (11.77\%), signifying excellent content validation. Reliability was 0.93 (p < 0.01), showing excellent statistical density. The general averages of D1 and D2 were 3.09 and 3.11 respectively, indicating satisfaction among the respondents. In conclusion, the participants recognize important advances such as curricular restructuring from these programs, placement of students already at the beginning of the course into practice scenarios, motivation toward interdisciplinarity, diversification of evaluation practices, and use of active methodologies. After factorial analysis, it was shown that medical and biomedical courses are more resistant to the contributions of the Pró-Saúde and PET-Saúde Programs and other hurdles were identified, such as excessive workload that hinders the integration of courses and the development of still-evolving administration and management skills. The interaction of the programs in Propet-Saúde should be strengthened, as it demonstrated significant assertiveness in curricular organization as well as in the teaching and service integration, a central aspect for the strengthening of Brazilian Public Health.",

Objective To evaluate the education of medical students (MS) of the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) and resident doctors (RD) at Hospital de Clínicas of the Federal University of Paraná (HC-UFPR) on the subject of dying and death. Method A quantitative observational study. A self-administered questionnaire was designed, with 28 multiple-choice questions, to evaluate education about the process of dying and death, with elements adapted from the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale Form B (FATCOD-B Scale). Results The questionnaire was completed by 805 MS (74.6\% of the total number of students enrolled in the first semester of 2016) and 93 RD (73.8\% of the total number of residents of clinical and surgical specialties enrolled in 2016). The report of experience of contact with dying people increased among the MS as they progressed through medical school, reaching near-totality among the first-year residents, and totality among those with the most specialized degrees in all specialties. 40.1\% of the MS and 51.1\% of the RD reported that they had received some kind of pedagogical orientation about death and dying during medical school. The influence of religious beliefs on education in this area was reported by 54\% of the MS and 44.3\% of the RD. 58\% of the MS and RD reported feelings of frustration and impotence following patients' deaths. Contact with patients in the dying process produced a range of feelings and perceptions among the MS and RD, including sadness, anguish, distancing, increased sensitivity, and professional maturation, among others. Conclusion MS and RD reported that they received little training about death during their medical training, and that their perceptions about the subject are influenced by multiple variables, such as religious belief. Contact with death also provokes equally diverse reactions. More studies are needed, to deepen the complexity of this issue in the field of medical training.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Radiology in medical school has taken on a new dimension in terms of its usefulness, not only as a complementary diagnostic instrument but also as a teaching tool integrated into the study of anatomy and pathology, among other subjects. Although knowledge of radiology is widely used in medical teaching, through active methodologies, there is a lack of studies reporting experiences of how students view the importance of this knowledge. Aim To study the perceptions of medical students on the inclusion of radiology in undergraduate education, through the use of active methodologies. Method A qualitative study, conducted with students enrolled in the third and fifth semesters. The sample comprised 12 subjects chosen from a population of 100 students at a public state university. Data were obtained from interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire with open questions about radiology teaching, its implications and applications in medicine, and positive and negative characteristics of the learning process using active methodologies. Data were analyzed separately, grouped by categorization, and submitted to thematic analysis by two researchers, before being reflected on jointly. There was also description of the environment and triangulation of the results. Results Latent, semantic, recurrent, unique, and controversial contents were identified. The recurrent themes in the interviews, identified as forming the basis of an advantageous strategy for radiodiagnostic teaching in undergraduate medical education, were as follows: (a) the need of an early introduction to radiology, due to its transversality and its importance to teaching; (b) a systematic study of the biophysical principles and vocabulary used in the field, to facilitate its study; (c) the role of complementary exams in the context of tutoring problems and (d) the development of teaching materials that use integrated content with a morphofunctional approach. Unique aspects, such as study difficulties related to knowledge of a foreign language and the use of social networks, and controversies regarding the teachers' role in the process and what it means to learn radiology in medical school were also considered elements that can be used as part of a modern approach, with radiology education currently being in a process of change. Conclusion It was concluded, according to the perceptions of the students interviewed, that the morphofunctional curricular component often used in problem-based teaching might be used to teach radiology and imaging diagnosis, within a multidimensional, contextualized, and transdisciplinary perspective. This goes beyond its role as a means of providing complementary exams, significantly integrating other sources of knowledge (especially anatomy and pathology) and facilitating the learning of both radiology and related subjects addressed in each study module.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Medical students are exposed to high stress levels, triggered by having to deal with their illness and death of their patients, extensive workloads, sleep deprivation, competition, having to fulfil demanding duties, responsibility, and fear of making mistakes, among other factors. Some techniques and practices, such as meditation, are used in medical schools to help manage and reduce stress. Stress can activate components of the inflammatory system, triggering a series of pathologies. The disorders caused by stress can be measured by means of serological markers, with biological markers being the main ones used. Objective. To evaluate the effects of a program of mind-body practices, Reduction of Stress and Development of Empathy in Medicine (REDEMED ©), on pro- and anti-inflammatory markers of medical students. Methodology This is a quasi-experimental study, composed of 86 students: 44 in the intervention group, who participated in the REDMED© program with eight-weekly meetings that included meditation techniques and exercises of interpersonal experiences, and 42 students in the control group. Before and after the course, blood was collected from both groups for analysis of the markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL06) and interleukin-10 (IL10). Results No statistically significant changes were observed in the proinflammatory cytokines CRP, TNF-α and IL06. However, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, showed a positive and statistically significant variation (p: 0.009). It has been used in studies with integrative and complementary practices to demonstrate its benefits. Conclusion The REDEMED© program seems to benefit medical students through inflammatory modulation and as a group that provides a forum to share their stress and receive coaching in coping strategies. This study, even though it did not find a statistically significant difference in the markers studied, with the exception of IL10, raises the important theme of the high levels of stress that medical students experience, and the need for medical schools to take greater care of their students, addressing stress in order better manage it in their own lives.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction In clinical learning scenarios, preceptors should mediate between the knowledge students already possess and the knowledge they need to acquire, integrating theory and practice into the patient care context. In order to make this possible, we must train preceptors and develop instruments for evaluating their performance as educators. In 2008, the Maastricht Clinical Teaching Questionnaire (MCTQ) was developed in the Netherlands with the purpose of enabling students to evaluate their preceptors, in order to provide preceptors with feedback regarding their teaching skills and the supervision provided by them during the internship period. Validating an instrument that has been translated is important and valuable, because it enables certain phenomena to be evaluated and investigated in different countries. Objective To validate the Portuguese-language version of the MCTQ. Methodology This is an instrument validation study, with research carried out in four different hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil. It applied the Portuguese-language version of the MCTQ to a non-probability sample composed of 246 fifth- and sixth-year students of Medicine from four different institutions in the state of Pernambuco. Kappa values were used to evaluate the validity of the construct, and reliability was measured using standardized Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The reproducibility level of the MCTQ was calculated using the Student's t-test for repeated measures, comparing test and re-test values. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Faculdade Pernambucana de Saúde. Results The kappa index was between 0.527 and 0.71, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was between 0.77 and 0.954, demonstrating that the instrument has good levels of agreement and internal consistency, respectively. With respect to reproducibility, all coefficient correlation values found were significant and showed good magnitude (≥0.72). Conclusion The Portuguese-language version of the MCTQ proved to be reliable and valid for use in Portuguese-language settings, and can be useful as an instrument for promoting pedagogical improvements in undergraduate and graduate courses, especially in health sciences.",

Thus, a female of C. prehensilis weighing 4kg, was sent to veterinary care. At first there was a hygiene process and debridement for necrotic edge removal. Furthermore, injected clindamycin (10mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly (IM), once a day (SID), tramadol (4mg/kg, IM, SID), flunixin (0.3mg/kg, SID), administered subcutaneously (SC) and iron dextran (25mg/kg, IM, SID). In spite of the established therapy, tissue necrotic growth was observed, which lead the wound treatment as healing by second intention, initiating an alternative therapy with laser beam and ozone. As a result, the healing was satisfactory due to the elected techniques, without signs of pain and infection. The adjuvant treatment with physiotherapy had advantageous effect and could be applied to wound healing in wild mammal animals.",

For the histopathological analysis, scores were developed according to the severity of the lesions, varying from 0 to 2. There was association (Chi-square, P< 0.05) between the macroscopic classification (A, B and C) and histological changes (0, 1 and 2). The A classification differed significantly (ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer, P< 0.05) from the B and C classifications regarding the histopathological scores observed. There was no difference in feet lesions that justified the separation between the feet classified in B and C, since both presented a linear delimitation of the lesions, suggesting superficiality and restriction to the keratinized epithelium. Therefore, the use of the feet for human consumption after mechanical removal of the footpad lesions is suggested since the product does not pose risks to the consumer.",

The patient was seen due to the appearance of a nodule in the nasolabial region with clinical evolution of about 30 days. Histologically, it was composed of an intraepidermal and annexal lymphoid proliferation. Neoplastic lymphocytes, T-cells confirmed by CD3-positive and CD79-negative immunolabeling, were large, round, and monomorphic cells. Although rare, pagetoid reticulosis is an easily suspected lymphoproliferative disorder based only on cell morphology.

Six stallions with a history of subfertility were used. After collection, ejaculate spermatozoa were divided into three aliquots: Botu-Semen® (EJ-CT); High-quality seminal plasma (EJ-PS1); Low-quality seminal plasma (EJ-PS2). The same was done with sperm cells from epididymis tail after orchiectomy (EP-CT; EP-PS1; EP-PS2). Evaluations of sperm kinetics were assessed by CASA and membrane and acrosome integrity, DNA fragmentation, sperm capacitation and sperm peroxidation were assessed by flow cytometry. After thawing, no differences were observed between ejaculated sperm (EJ) and epididymal sperm (EP) in any CASA evaluations. However, higher (P< 0.05) percentage of cells with intact plasma and acrossomal membranes was observed in EP groups (EP-CT:31.7±7.5b; EP-PS1:35.2±7.0b; EP-PS2:33.9±7.2b) compared to EJ groups (EJ-CT:15.1±4.9a, EJ-PS1:11.7±4.5a, EJ-PS2:13.1±5,2a).

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Currently the use of portable sensors for measuring ketone bodies is standardized and diffused in the clinical routine, however, studies in sheep are scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the human portable sensor and the veterinary portable sensor for the determination of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in sheep at the end of gestation and postpartum. We used 37 samples of blood from nine crossbred Corriedale sheep. Biochemical determination of serum BHB, considered gold standard, was performed using colorimetric enzymatic methodology. The mean serum biochemistry was 0.497mmol/L, in the human sensor the mean was 0.537mmol/L, while in the veterinary sensor it was 0.751mmol/L. A high correlation was verified between the dosimeter for human use and the gold standard (r= 0.93, P< 0.001). The mean of the veterinary apparatus differed from the others, being 51\% (P< 0,05), higher than the standard, that is, it was less accurate and had lower veracity, overestimating the results in sheep. It was concluded that the portable sensor for human use is more accurate and accurate in the early diagnosis of toxemia of pregnancy in sheep.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The types I and III collagens present different tonalities of birefringence in histological sections stained with Picrosirius red, that can be analyzed under a polarized light microscope. Based on this property, collagens can be quantified by histomorphometry. However, many variables can affect the color distribution in the histological image, and the appropriate choice of the analysis parameters have a significant influence on the final result. The objective of this study was to compare the histomorphometric quantification of collagen in the equine skin by counting points planimetry and color segmentation with different configurations to determine the best method of evaluation. For planimetry, three different graticules (391, 588 and 792 intersections) were used and, for color segmentation, six combinations of hue and brightness in ImageJ software. The values were submitted to the Friedman test followed by Tukey with 5\% significance. The results showed that the quantification of collagens in the graticule of 792 intersections was equivalent to the results of color segmentation with a brightness of 1-255 and hue of 0-42 and 43-120 for collagens type I and III, respectively. Automatic analysis of the color segmentation, using suitable configuration for brightness and hue can replace the counting points planimetry reliably and safely.",

The minimum and mean temperature in the meteorological station were higher than on the farm throughout the experimental period and in 16 months, respectively. The maximum temperature of the rural property was greater than that of the station in six months. Meanwhile, the minimum, average, and maximum relative humidity of the meteorological station were lower than those of the farm. The minimum THI was higher at the official station and the maximum THI was higher at the farm in every month. Finally, the number of days with a maximum THI equal to or greater than the critical THI was greater on the farm. Thus, official weather station data underestimate the heat stress.",

The first describes perceptions regarding ethics teaching, showing that it is necessary to reflect on the complexity of the teaching-learning process. There are perceptions of devalued education, dissociated from the practice and highlighting the need for the qualification of educators. The second category presents suggestions for the teaching of ethics, among them, to deepen and demand the humanities content throughout the course. To qualify the teaching of ethics, it is necessary to provide interactive and participative moments, between educators and students, that favor the knowledge and comprehensiveness of the problems identified.

Results: Of the 26 intensive care units in Maranhão, 23 were evaluated; 15 (65.2\%) were located in the state capital, and 14 (60.9\%) were public. The mean final score was 67.2 (54.2\% of the maximum). The worst performance was observed with regard to processes (50.9\%) in the units located outside the capital (p = 0.037) and for hospitals with 68 beds or fewer (p = 0.027). The result of the assessment categorized services as a function of the overall total points earned. Specifically, 8 (34.8\%) services were assessed as insufficient, 13 (56.5\%) were assessed as typical, and 2 (8.7\%) were assessed as sufficient. Conclusion: The majority of the intensive care units in this study were assessed as typical. These services must be better qualified.

Hematological analyzers perform automated immature granulocyte counts (IG) quickly and with no additional cost when compared to traditional microbiological cultures. Elevated IG is directly associated with infections and inflammation. Objectives: Evaluate IG as infection marker in adult inpatients at the ICU-Complexo Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná (CHC-UFPR), compared to cultures of biological materials (gold standard). Material And Methods: Samples of 200 adult inpatients at CHC-UFPR ICU with suspected infection were used. Absolute (IG\#) and relative (IG\%) counts were performed on the Sysmex XN-3000. Cultures and blood cultures were performed either manually or on Bactec FX. Diagnostic accuracy and agreement for IG\# and IG\% were evaluated. Results: The reference intervals (RI) obtained for IG\# and IG\% were 0.06 × 103/µl and 0.6\%, respectively, with sensitivity for both of 74.4\% and specificity of 25.3\% for IG\#, and 26.6\% for IG\%. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed cut-off value of 0.33 × 103/µl for IG\#, sensitivity of 28\%, specificity of 82.3\%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.521. For IG\%, cut-off value was 1.35\%, sensitivity 44.6\%, specificity 64.6\%, and AUC 0.532. CV < 3\% increased specificity to 88\%. Conclusion: RI of IG\% and IG\# showed high sensitivity and are useful in screening for infection in ICU patients. The CVs demonstrated by the ROC curves showed high specificity and are helpful on the exclusion of sepsis diagnosis in ICU patients. IG was shown to be useful for screening and confirmation of infection in ICU patients.",

Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were aliquoted into five different tubes and stored at room temperature. The first aliquot was immediately analyzed and the others analyzed after 2, 4, 6 and 12 hours. For cytological analysis, samples of at least 20 leukocytes/mm3 were included. Analysis of variance of the results and the comparison of the clinical interpretation of the results at the different times were performed. Results: There was no significant decrease in the number of leukocytes and erythrocytes by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The clinical interpretation of the cytology did not result in different results in any of the evaluated times. There was no significant variation in the biochemical parameters. Conclusion: The results suggest that the storage of CSF samples for 12 hours at room temperature does not significantly compromise clinical interpretation. Future studies are still required in order to evaluate the behavior of these parameters in samples of cell counts closer to boundered values.",

Expenditures with drugs were negatively related to PA (r = -0.194, p-value = 0.035 and r = -0.281, p-value = 0.002), but positively related with sleep quality (r = 0.299, p-value=0.001 and r = 0.315, p-value = 0.001) and age (r = 0.274, p-value = 0.003). Four multivariate models were executed considering lifestyle behaviors in different moments of cohort and medicine costs, and all these models identify important relationship between lifestyle behaviors with expenditures with drugs. Conclusion: Worse sleep quality seems to increase the costs related to medicine use in adults, while obesity and ageing play a relevant role in this phenomenon and alcohol consumption seems a variable with relevant economic impact.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The objective of this work is to describe the expectations of medical students regarding their professional career. In order to do this, a cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study was conducted, from January 2014 to December 2017, with 116 senior students of the class of 2014, 116 of 2015, 91 of 2016 and 110 of 2017, with a total of 431 individuals. A survey was applied to obtain information about their age, gender, graduation year, professional expectations for the 10 years to follow, intended specialty, level of care at which they want to work, intended income, the number of jobs they think they will need to work in to reach that level of income and the number of jobs they expect to have. The study showed that there are more male students (58\%) than female, and the average age is 26.4 ± 3.91 years old. General Medicine was the most sought specialty by the graduate students, except for those of the year 2016, when the predominant specialty was Pediatrics. Concerning the professional goals for the 10 years after graduation, teaching was an objective of approximately half of them, ranging between 46\% and 59\%, while almost all of them demonstrated a wish to perform assistance work (direct patient care). No predominance was found when comparing the expectation of working in a hospital or in private clinics, nor between the private and public sector. Concerning the wish to work at different health care levels, the senior students from the classes of 2014 and 2016 expressed their wish to work predominantly at care level 3 (40.5 ± 29.3\% and 41.1 ± 29.7\%, respectively). Concerning the intended income, the most popular range was above 10 minimum monthly salaries. Most students stated they believe that at least three jobs would be necessary to reach this salary level, but they also expressed the wish of having only two jobs. We conclude that the so-called basic areas, such as General Medicine, General Surgery and Pediatrics are the most coveted by the senior students. However, this is probably due not only to a desire to follow these specialties, but also because they represent a prerequisite to access other specialties. In general, the graduates intend to work with direct care and have high salary expectations, which is only achieved by having multiple jobs. They have little interest in working at care level one. This reality could be discussed in academic circles, in order to offer realistic information to students about the job market and medical career, minimizing future frustrations during their professional practice.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Established in 2014, the National Curricular Guidelines (NCG) for the Undergraduate Medical Course contain several recommendations, especially for Medical Internship. Despite the recognition of the need for changes, in terms of professional training to meet the demands of the community, instituting these NCG was considered by many to be rather undemocratic. Yet, few studies have investigataed the implementation process. The objective was to analyze the Medical Internship in Medical Schools of the State of Rio de Janeiro, after institution of the NCG of 2014, according to the Course and Internship Coordinators. In 2016, the State of Rio de Janeiro had 19 medical courses, in 15 Medical Schools. Of these, nine courses participated in the research. The study population was represented by 13 participants, nine Course Coordinators and four Internship Coordinators. It is thus a sample of the universe of schools, with no intention of generalizing the results to represent the whole State. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used. The answers of the open-ended questions were submitted to content analysis, the scale was evaluated by statistical analysis. In the view of the Coordinators participating in the research, all Medical Schools are in the process of adapting to the NGC's determinations of 2014. The majority agrees with the mandatory inclusion of Urgency and Emergency, Primary Care and Mental Health in the Internship areas. Many difficulties were encountered in the process of implantation and/or restructuring of these activities in Internship: scarcity of practical scenarios; precariousness of existing scenarios in emergency care of the Unified Health System; lack of teachers/preceptors; and the deadline established for the implementation of the Guidelines. However, some strategies have been planned, such as the diversification of practice scenarios, the creation of elective internships, the establishment of agreements and partnerships, development of integrated activities with other Internships areas and the use of realistic simulation laboratories. The Medical Schools live a moment of curricular transformation, driven by the NCG. We must see this moment as an opportunity to revisit the Medical Internship and, possibly, to find strategies for the improvement of medical training in this privileged undergraduate space. It is believed that dissemination of the results of this research can help Medical Schools in their appropriation and implementation of the NCGs of 2014.",

Several techniques can be used to teach communication skills to medical students. Objective To report an experience based on the role-play technique in the learning process and the satisfaction of medical students in the application of the medical interview. Methods A cross-sectional study with students of the discipline of semiology in three distinct stages related to theory comprehension, practical application with role-play simulation among students and taped interviews with patients in the hospital. Student performance evaluation during simulation and video recording was based on an instrument adapted from the Calgary-Cambridge Guide. A student satisfaction survey was also conducted at the end of the semester. Results Thirty students were evaluated, 43\% were not able to adequately detail the symptoms during the simulation but did not present the same difficulty in the taped video. When comparing the simulation and the taped videos exercise 5 students (16.6\%) showed the same performance, 1 student (3.3\%) displayed a worse performance with the patient interview and 25 students (83\%) improved their performance with patients. The vast majority (92.5\%) of the students considered the activity useful in their medical training. Conclusion: The use of the role-play technique in the teaching process of anamnesis and in the development of communication skills was demonstrated as a useful learning method and was well accepted by the medical students that participated in this study.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Disorders of the musculoskeletal system represent between 10-25\% of the reasons for consultations in primary care, however, only a small percentage of the undergraduate curriculum is dedicated to the study of this subject. Thus, it is necessary to develop objective instruments to assess this deficiency in medical schools. The Freedman and Bernstein questionnaire is an internationally validated tool for assessing basic medical knowledge of musculoskeletal disorders and, consequently, evaluate medical training. The objective of this study was to develop a version of the scale in the Portuguese language, validated and adapted transculturally for the Brazilian population. Transcultural translation and adaptation of the questionnaire was conducted following the steps of initial translation, back-translation, composition of a pre-final version and its test, making the necessary changes after this last phase and development of the final model of the instrument. The pre-final version was applied to the target audience of the research - 15 students in the last semester of Medicine. Each individual answered the questions from the survey and was then interviewed to analyze their understanding of what was expected in each item of the questionnaire. Both the interpretation of the question and the response were explored. There were difficulties in understanding two questions, making it necessary to substitute some terms to facilitate assimilation. After the changes, there were no impediments to the participants' understanding of the final instrument. Content validation was assessed by a panel of experts who considered the terms and scope of the translated questionnaire appropriate. This assessment was made after the final test and no change was recommended. Thus, the questionnaire is translated into the Portuguese language, presenting semantic, idiomatic, conceptual and cultural equivalence with the original. Its use is recommended for the evaluation of the teaching of musculoskeletal disorders in the country's medical schools, allowing a comparison of the Brazilian orthopedic curriculum with international standards.",

In health education, assessment has peculiarities and requires constant dialogue between teachers and students in order to achieve improvements. The objective of this study was to draw up an initial diagnosis of the evaluation process in the medical course of a Public Higher Education Institution of the State of Paraná, from the perspective of teachers and students. This was an exploratory study, with a qualitative methodological approach, and of an interpretative nature, performed with twenty-two (22) teachers and twenty (20) medical intern students. Data collection took place from November 2015 to February 2016, with a semi-structured interview of an individual character that was recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed by content analysis, which were decoded and grouped by subject similarity, from which four categories of analysis emerged. The results show that the study participants pointed out difficulties in the evaluation; teachers were mentioned: the need for didactic-pedagogical training and the evaluation of skills, strategies for improvements in feedback, self-assessment of the student and the standardization of the evaluation process conducted by the teachers. It is concluded that in the art of evaluation, the participation of teachers and students becomes na important strategy for adjustments and improvements. Reflections on the role of actors in the educational setting are beneficial to the formation of both. The inclusion of feedback, self-assessment and standardization are unique elements and collaborate with the evaluation process.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT This study resulted from the observed considerable increase in integrative practices in health and their insertion in the Brazilian Unified Health System through the National Policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PNPIC) of 2006. The question then arises of the reasons that led to this increase. The present study analyzed the reasons behind newly trained physicians seeking to specialize in Acupuncture at the Federal University of São Paulo, a recent medical residency program in the profession. The authors used an Oral History methodology due to its humanizing potential when dealing with accounts given by colleagues and to help interviewees recall their experiences. Data analysis was carried out using the Immersion and Crystallization method, based on hermeneutic phenomenology, through which common themes emerged in the narratives of the interviewees, which could then be analyzed based on the current literature. From the collected and analyzed narratives it is observed that dissatisfaction with the practice of the biomedical model is a major factor that influences the physicians' choice of Acupuncture. That model is seen to treat the patient as a being that is compartmentalized into multiple specialties, transforming the patient into pieces without really assessing their existence as a person and their health as a whole. All the interviewees stated that they consider Acupuncture a more humane health care practice, corresponding to their longing to treat the patient, not only their parts, or their isolated symptoms, which factor is fundamental to understanding the growth of these practices. A deeper analysis of the narratives allowed us to observe that in the life history of these young doctors there are experiences that have enabled them to be willing to develop their humanity more intensely. Another conspicuous feature that emerged in the narratives was the fact that none of the interviewees had any contact with Acupuncture during their undergraduate medical training, which demonstrates its incipient insertion in the academic environment, even though this practice has been recognized by the Federal Council of Medicine as a medical specialty since the 1990s.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate students' perceptions about the use of the TBL methodology in Medical School and to analyze the different aspects of the application of this teaching method. A specific questionnaire was applied to the students with 8 questions and dichotomized answers (Likert scale with 5 items). During the month of June 2017 second and fourth year undergraduate medical students underwent several sessions of teaching with the TBL method at the Municipal University of São Caetano do Sul (USCS) with focus on the following themes: sepsis; trauma; leukemia; colorectal cancer; and lung cancer. The sample was calculated on 193 participants considering a relative precision of 10\% and a statistical significance of 5\% for an estimate of 70\% of positive responses (strongly agree and agree) to the statement ``This TBL had a positive impact on my learning''. The analysis was performed with descriptive statistics and the relative and absolute frequencies of responses with a 95\% confidence interval for each estimated point. The use of the method was perceived as positive in aspects of preference (regarding the traditional expository class), motivation, satisfaction and learning. TBL stood out as an excellent pedagogical method for learning among medical students. One of the advantages was the ability to develop skills in clinical reasoning and the possibility of building knowledge with its practical use. The active method was thus found to be an important methodological alternative when compared to the traditional method.",

 abstract = "Abstract Background: Pericardium tissue allograft can be used for surgical repair in several procedures. One of the tissue engineering strategies is the process of decellularization. This process decreases immunogenic response, but it may modify the natural extracellular matrix composition and behavior. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cell removal, maintenance of extracellular matrix properties and mechanical integrity of decellularized human pericardium using a low concentration solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Methods: Decellularization was performed with sodium dodecyl sulfate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Histological analysis, DNA quantification, evaluation of glycosaminoglycans and collagen were performed. Biomechanical assay was performed using tensile test to compare the decellularization effects on tissue properties of tensile strength, elongation and elastic modulus. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: There was reduction in visible nuclei present in pericardium tissue after decellularization, but it retained collagen and elastin bundles similar to fresh pericardium. The DNA contents of the decellularized pericardium were significantly reduced to less than 511.23 ± 120.4 ng per mg of dry weight (p < 0.001). The biomechanical assay showed no significant difference for fresh or decellularized tissue. Conclusion: The decellularization process reduces cell content as well as extracellular matrix components without changing its biomechanical properties.",

The objective of the research was to analyze the emotional response of doctors to the stimuli of the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). This study used a quantitative method and evaluated 30 male and female doctors of various specialties, who dedicated all or some of their working hours to clinical care, had at least two years of experience after conclusion of medical residency and worked in conventional medicine (medical clinic). The instruments used for the analysis were: sociodemographic questionnaire to analyze the variables; the IAPS, composed of affective images capable of inducing emotional states and the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to classify responses through two scales: pleasure and arousal. The results showed that in relation to emotional perception there was no difference between the sample results and the general population, but differences were found in the relation to sociodemographic variables: age, time since graduation, average consultation time and weekly hours devoted to work in the consulting room, concluding that older doctors, with more time since graduation and more time in consultation with the patient, felt more impacted by the emotional stimuli than younger doctors with less training time and less time with the patient in consultation. The results also showed that doctors who work more hours per week in the consulting room perceived the stimuli in a less pleasant way than doctors who spend less time in the consulting room and share their time with other activities. Further research and studies are needed to deepen the theme of emotions and their influence on medical practice, considering larger samples in different contexts and new variables.",

The data were collected through two focus groups: The first with students and the second with teachers. Content analysis was used to evaluate the focus group. Students and teachers shared the view that the development of the new curriculum is flawed. The institution was able to write the new pedagogical project based on the 2014 NCGs, but resources for the development of the new curriculum are scarce. The students pointed out the depreciation of the teaching in primary health care by some teachers and the lack of longitudinality in the teaching of the primary health care. Teachers highlighted the lack of support from municipal management, shortage of internships field and qualified trainers for this change. As for the physical structure, in general, lack of inputs and reforms, and within the university a lack of didactic resources, which ends up discouraging the students and teachers. Achieving internships, materials and professionals who accept receiving students are also highlighted as challenges. The new curriculum, although designed to contemplate teaching in PHC, faces resistance and lacks teachers with specific training in the area.",

Although we imagine that many of these foreigners sought - for cultural and religious reasons - alternative cure methods rather than official medicine, often diseases did not improve, and it was frequently necessary to go to the hospital to deal with the terrible physical ailments that affected them. When considering this important moment in the life of Africans in Brazil - that of dealing with serious illness - the entry records are a privileged source. The intention is to consider, based on the initial sample, ways of analyzing the presence of Africans in the Santa Casa de Misericórdia of Bahia, to get closer to who they were and how they lived. The data indicates, in addition to their names, ages, condition, marital status, profession, colour and nationality, the problems with which the patients arrived, the exact date of check-in, the ward that they were taken to and the precise date of check-out, or if it was the case, of death. Additionally, I consider the medical conceptions of the 19th century regarding diseases of Africans, as well as the conditions of functioning of the institution itself, related to part of the vast bibliography about the theme of the health of slaves. The article concludes with the narrative of life of one African, speculating about the possibilities and directions that he could have taken throughout his life, which were common to the majority of Africans in Bahia then.",

This interpretation was rejected by the doctor Antônio Gonçalves Gomide (1770-1835), graduated in Europe, who published his analysis in Analytical Impugnation (...) (1814). This document allows us to examine the universe of medicine from the beginning of the 19th century in Brazil and it makes clear the rivalry among doctors and surgeons. The doctor, guided by the principles of illustrated science, and based on medicine studies, relied on Philippe Pinel's work (1745-1826) and others alienists. Analyzing the pathological manifestations of the Blessed as a nervous disease, Gomide produced what can be considered the first document about alienism in Brazil. The doctor left space for the debate on this modern medical specialty in the country. This perception points at a re-reading of the historiography about mental illness, demonstrating that the scientific knowledge about alienation has been upgraded in Brazil since the 1810s.",

Additionally, 242 serum samples were tested by serum neutralization (SN) for the detection of antibodies against BoHV-1, BoHV-5 and BuHV. All clinical samples were collected in a slaughterhouse located in Pelotas, RS, Brazil. BoHV-1 DNA was detected in 61 (30.1\%) of the samples and SN revealed 27.6\% of the animals with neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the tested viruses. Nucleotide sequencing of 15 amplicons followed by BLAST analysis confirmed the presence of BoHV-1 DNA in the analyzed tissues. Taken together, these data indicate that BoHV-1 infection is distributed in buffaloes in southern Brazil. However, the role of buffaloes in the BoHV-1 epidemiology needs further investigation.",

The grazing method was the rotational and the interval between grazings was set by the thermal sum required for the appearing of 1.5 ryegrass leaf (187.5ºC). The experimental design was completely randomized with repeated measures. Heifers average daily gain did not differ between the feeding systems. The stocking rate and weight gain per area were higher when heifers received 1.0\% BW of whole rice bran. The higher gross margin was observed when heifers received 0.5\% BW. The variable cost obtained for the different feeding systems showed increasing behavior depending on the WRB levels, surpassing the exclusive use of ryegrass in 49.4\% and 81.8\%. The final body weight, body condition score and reproductive tract score did not differ between the feeding systems. Considering an adult animal with an average body weight of 450kg, the heifers at the beginning of the experiment showed 34\% of mature body weight and final average body weight of 56\% of adult weight. The use of rice bran levels (FAZ) in the rearing of beef heifers under rotational grazing on ryegrass does not change the average daily gain and the reproductive tract score. The supply of 1\% FAI showed substitutive effect, providing an increase in capacity of 31,2\% and 38.3\% rate of the gain per area. The food system AZ0,5 allowed a higher gross margin, as the economic return was positive in all food systems, with better return calculated for the exclusive use of ryegrass.",

We report a case of a four-year-old male Yorkshire terrier with clinical signs of pain, calcification in the pelvis and renal diverticulum. According to the owner, the dog had been receiving omeprazole for over 2 years because of the history of hydrocephalus. Hematological exams revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia, hypokalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia besides hypercalciuria. The determination of serum parathyroid hormone concentrations confirmed hypoparathyroidism. After interrupting omeprazole, the altered features on the exams returned to normal values, confirming that the cause of hypoparathyroidism was the chronic use of the drug.",

The experiment was carried out from July to September of the years 2015 and 2016. Sperm collections of Canindé (n = 4) and British Alpine (n = 7) males were performed using artificial vagina. After collection, the sperm was evaluated for volume (ml), concentration (sptz/ml), motility (\%), and vigor (1-5). Then diluted in ACP-101c and cryopreserved in TK3000TM machine. Subsequently, kinetic parameters were analyzed through SCA TM software and mitochondrial activity. In fresh sperm, the two races presented values of motility and concentration within the recommended for the specie. However, volume and scrotal circumference values were higher in the British Alpine breed (0.73 mL ± 0.32; 27.35 cm ± 2.09) than in the Canindé breed (0.36 mL ± 0.07; 23 , 25 cm ± 0.95) (p <0.05).

Therefore, fresh sperm from both breeds can be used in reproductive biotechniques. On the other hand, the post-thawed sperm of the Canindé breed showed better quality, probably because the animals were more adapted to the adverse conditions of the Northeast region and are recommended for artificial insemination programs.",

Each sample was incubated in duplicate and one was fixed in 4\% formalized sodium citrate solution. Two hundred spermatozoa were evaluated from each sample and classified as reactive or not- reactive to HOST.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The species Leopardus pardalis is one of the species of neotropical felines more studied in its ecological aspects, however, information of morphophysiological questions of the digestive tract are not found in the literature. Aiming to contribute with such information, the objective of this work was to characterize the morphology of the stomach of this species. Five adult specimens, collected after death by trampling, or donated by IBAMA to the Laboratory of Zoology and Animal Morphology of the University of the State of Mato Grosso - Alta Floresta, were used in this research. The animals were fixed with aqueous solution of formaldehyde 10\%, dissected through the basic techniques and instruments of anatomy, and later the material was collected for microscopy. The macroscopic analysis revealed that the stomach was of the unicavitary type, with small and great curvature, located in the left antimer and constituted by the characteristic regions of the organ. In its microscopic aspects it was formed by the four usual tunics of the digestive tube: tunica mucosa, submucosa, muscular and serosa, each one with the peculiarities characteristic of each region, mainly in the tunica mucosa. The stomach of L. pardalis revealed similar morphology to the domestic and wild species, with small histomorphological peculiarities in the pyloric region, which may be related to evolutionary adaptations in the digestive process of this species.",

Neutralizing antibodies anti-BoHV-1, anti-BVDV or both were detected in 62.5\% (165/264), 45.1\% (119/264), and 31.4\% (83/264), respectively, in the samples analyzed. The risk factors associated with infection by BoHV-1 were herds with more than 100 cows, the presence of mechanical milking, the non-utilization of artificial insemination, and the infrequent acquisition of animals. Risk factors associated with BVDV were dual-purpose herds (milk and beef), these include the utilization of mechanical milking, absence of quarantine for newly acquired animals, the presence of picket calving, and the absence of artificial insemination. For simultaneous infections by both viruses (BoHV-1 and BVDV) the use of mechanical milking increased the chance of infection 3.36-fold while the use of artificial insemination reduced the risk of infection by 56\% in these herds.",

 abstract = "ABTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Tagetes minuta L. essential oil against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and its cytotoxicity to bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T line), aiming at its use for bovine mastitis treatment. The qualitative analysis of the oil by GC-MS identified cis-tagetone (24.24\%), dihydrotagetone (16.65\%), 1,3,6-Octatriene 3,7-Dimethyl-E (13.61\%); trans-ocimenone (13.52\%) and cis-ocimenone (10.06\%) as major compounds. Antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution technique and revealed the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1mg/mL for the standard strain of S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and five bacterias isolated from mastitic milk, including a multiresistant strain (ATCC 33592); and 3mg/ml for the standard strain of E. coli (ATCC 8739) and two bacterias isolated from mastitic milk. However, a strong citotoxic effect on MAC-T cells was found. Oil concentrations from 10(g/mL resulted in over 90\% of cell death. The results suggest that although the antimicrobial activity was identified against the main agents of bovine mastitis, the intramammary use of T. minuta oil may not be recommended. On the other hand, it is important to highlight the sensibility of the MSRA strain to the essential oil, which evidences its potential as an antiseptic or sanitizer.",

Sixty ewes of Dorper breed were divided into two groups by pregnancy ultrasonographic diagnosis: 1 - 30 ewes with single fetus gestation; 2 - 30 ewes with twin pregnancy. In nine collection moments the following parameters were measured: urea, creatinine, total protein (TP), albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides. The weight of G2 sheep was higher than G1 since they were empty. There were differences in G1 and G2 sheep metabolism in TP, Albumin, AST and Triglycerides. From 120 days of pregnancy, the protein profile changed, with lower levels of urea, TP, albumin and globulin, showing that the metabolic demand intensified in the last month of pregnancy. The levels of cholesterol and triglycerides decreased from 140 days of pregnancy to lambing day. This study showed that gestation provided significant changes in the ewe's metabolism, especially in the final third of gestation, when there is a greater need to follow the animals to avoid the incidence of metabolic diseases.",

A thematic review of scientific literature was conducted involving the areas of Medicine, Sociology of Medicine, Health Science and Technology and Public Health, in order to provide an interdisciplinary approach to the issue. The study focuses on rare diseases caused by genetic mutations, as they are paradigmatic for understanding the challenges posed to the medical field. Since the 1970s, changes have occurred in Medicine, in the ways of diagnosing, classifying and studying such diseases, from clinical, laboratorial and epidemiological perspectives, as well as in the development of technologies for prevention and intervention. As of 1970, HTA has developed as an area of knowledge and practice aimed at contributing to the scientific and institutional foundations of innovation policies in health systems. Countries have been facing challenges to the sustainability of their health systems, which stem from scientific and technological development and medical innovations, economic and political power of corporations, increased expectations, aging populations and political and social inequalities. Discourses carrying disparate scientific, technological and political views on medicine and health policies coexist, posing difficulties to dialogue. Meanwhile, society, marginalized from the world of specialists, faces many problems in understanding such discourses, being heard and participating in the construction of new perspectives on health and disease that offer answers to their problems.",

The cytometry technique has revolutionized the way that the cells are identified, and over the years this platform has progressed with several advances in hardware and software that aim to improve workflow resulting in higher productivity, quality and cost savings. The Aquios CL - Beckman Coulter (BC) is an example of this advance because it is a complete automation instrument in flow cytometry called ``Load \& Go flow cytometer'' for quantification of lymphocyte subpopulations in the routine diagnosis. In this study, the Aquios CL was validated, and quantification in frequency and absolute numbers of the lymphocyte subpopulations had an excellent correlation with the results obtained by the dual platform quantification performed in the Cytomics FC500 (BC) and automated Sysmex XE-2100 cell analyzer.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Clinical laboratories must have quality management systems that guarantee the reliability of their results. Furthermore, in longitudinal studies, it is important that the generated data be analyzed over time, as an additional measure of quality control (QC), seeking to identify fluctuations not explainable by biological variables. Applying this strategy to the SHIP-Brazil study was the aim of this work. Thus, we analyzed the results of fasting glucose, post-load glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the participants of the SHIP-Brazil study, from July 2014 to November 2016, in relation to the following aspects: difference of each individual's results from the mean of the month over time, mean and median of results over time, and percentage of results above the reference values over time, with trend line. According to the observed data, in order to guarantee the correct association of laboratory parameters with different health and disease conditions, the fasting blood glucose and post-load glucose measurements in the samples collected during the first months of the study are consistent, despite being performed in two different facilities. This QC strategy has proved very useful, and may even be used by clinical laboratories in their routine, observing result fluctuations of their population in the course of time, being capable of eventually detect bias even before the routine practices of internal and external quality control.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Determination of lipid profile includes triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol and fractions as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c). These parameters are valuable in the risk assessment of developing cardiovascular disease. However, some pre-analytical factors, such as the fasting state, may interfere with the results of these tests. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate differences on lipid profile measurements in blood samples collected at different fasting periods in men and women with or without a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Methods: Fifty volunteers of both sexes, aged between 22 and 86 years, were evaluated. Sociodemographic data and two blood samples were collected, one after 12 hours fast and another during postprandial period, with subsequent measurement of total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and TG. Results: Comparing the values of the lipid profile obtained in the two collections, it was observed that the total cholesterol and HDL-c did not present significant differences among the evaluated subjects. On the other hand, LDL-c and TG showed significant higher values on postprandial samples, preferably in male group. Conclusion: These data suggest that TG and LDL-c levels are the fractions with greater susceptibility to variations when they are collected without prior fasting.",

This article aims to explore the perceptions of nursing and medical students regarding the institutional factors that interfere in the adoption of IPE initiatives in their training contexts. It is a case study, which adopted the qualitative approach and the exploratory perspective. The research participants were nursing and medical students from two public universities from a Brazilian Northeastern state - one state and one federal. The focus group was chosen for data collection, and the categorical content analysis technique was used, observing the phases of pre-analysis, material exploration and treatment of results. Three thematic categories were built a posteriori: the importance of teamwork, the institutional contexts for the adoption of the IPE and challenges for the adoption of the IPE. Although the realities researched present advances in curricular changes, such as the approximation of teaching with the reality of services, the adoption of more active methods for the formation of critical and reflexive subjects, the gaps in the development of collaborative competences are still notorious.",

 abstract = "Abstract Objective: To evaluate the cognitive abilities of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia diagnosed through neonatal screening and to compare them with healthy controls, adjusting the results to their socioeconomic status. Methods: Cognitive assessment was performed with the Wechsler WISC-III scale in 64 children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia and in 64 controls matched by gender and age, without the disease and without neurological impairment; socioeconomic status was measured by the Criterion Brasil. Results: All cognitive scores were lower in the group of patients. The mean overall IQ, Verbal IQ, and Performance IQ were, respectively, 90.95 for the group of patients and 113.97 for the controls (p < 0.001); 91.41 for the group of patients and 112.31 for the controls (p < 0.001); 92.34 for the group of patients and 113.38 for the controls (p < 0.001). Scores for processing speed, distraction resistance, and perceptual organization were also significantly lower in patients. A direct and significant correlation was detected between socioeconomic status and cognitive scores. In the multivariate analysis, for the same socioeconomic status, a child with sickle cell anemia had an average IQ of 21.2 points lower than the mean IQ observed for the controls (p < 0.001), indicating that the disease, adjusted for the socioeconomic effect, is a strong predictor of the overall IQ. Conclusion: The cognitive impairment of children with sickle cell anemia is severe and manifests even when the disease effect is adjusted to the socioeconomic status. In the authors' view, such impairment requires an early preventive approach in order to avoid this cognitive damage.",

The final sample consisted of 75 individuals who used psychotropic drugs. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 18.0, using the chi-square test. Results and Discussion: We observed that 8\% of the studied population use psychotropic drugs, and the most used is BZD (78.67\%). Regarding age, 68\% are young adults and 26.67\% are elderly. The income of 81.33\% of households is more than one minimum wage. As for marital status, 50.85\% and 66.67\%, respectively of the indigenous group using BZD and other psychotropic drugs are married. Conclusion: The study outlined the profile of the Xukuru de Cimbres indigenous people who used psychotropics and showed a fragmented mental health care focused on the disease and the use of medication. Results reveal a socioeconomically vulnerable adult population, a pattern of chronic use of psychotropic drugs and distancing from traditional indigenous healing, typical of the health medicalization process.",

Studies guided by a critical perspective, which values the educational, social and historical conditions of the subject's constitution were also observed.

 abstract = "Abstract Cannabis sativa L. has been used since before the Christian Era to treat numerous diseases, but in the early 20th century, its use has been banned in several countries, including for medicinal purposes, for being considered illicit drug. However, the need to obtain alternatives to conventional treatments increased the interest for the therapeutic use of this plant, reason why several studies have been carried out, which verified that Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main compounds of the plant, has great therapeutic potential. In Brazil, its internal commercialization is prohibited, but since 2015 the compassionate use and importation of the substance has been authorized by the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM) and by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa); however, the demand for CBD continues to be judicialized. The objective of this interdisciplinary research was precisely in this aspect, which was to analyze the constitutive exterior of the problem of access to the referred drug. For that, a documentary and exploratory research was performed, using the qualitative approach, in addition to the bibliographic review. The case study was carried out with the Judicial Processes of the Court of Justice of Pernambuco (TJ/PE) on the subject, located from the grouped insertion of the keywords ``supply'' and ``Cannabidiol'' in the field ``jurisprudence'' of the virtual site of this Court. As a result, it was found that individuals who file a lawsuit meet the requirements of regulatory agencies, which allows to conclude that the administrative refusal to provide the drug by the state of Pernambuco characterizes violation of their right to health.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate and measure the effects of mental health internship on Medicine Students (MS) attitudes towards people with mental illness (PMI). Methods MS was submitted to an attitude questionnaire previously and after the mental health internship. Their attitudes were measured inside five factors: (F1) ``social acceptance of PMI'', (F2) ``normalizing roles for PMI'', (F3) ``non-belief in supernatural causes for mental illness'', (F4) ``belief in bio-psychosocial causes for mental illness,'' and (F5) ``near contact with PTM''. T-tests were used to evaluate factor differences, confounding factor were analyzed by ANOVA and correlations through Pearson's correlation test. Results 74 of 85 students responded. There were a significant reduction in four factors (F1, p < 0.001, F2, p = 0.002, F3, p = 0.04, F5, p < 0.001). An association between having a PMI friend and F3 was identified before the course (p = 0.04), but not after (p = 0.13). A positive correlation was identified between belief in disease improvement and negative F2 attitudes before course (p = 0.01), but not after (0.40). F5 was related with disease improvement after course (p < 0.001), suggesting positive attitudes when improvement is expected. There were an increase in improvement expectations after course for schizophrenia (p = 0.02), bipolar disorder (p = 0.03) and anxiety (p = 0.03). Conclusions Mental health internship was related to a decrease in negative attitudes towards PMI. Personal contact seems to influence this improvement. We believe that the reduction of fear toward PMI is more powerful to reduce stigma than the acquisition of knowledge about its natural causes. More studies with a regionally distinct population in Brazil and aimed to measure the impact of fear are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

We propose to analyze the philosophical premises that frame the opinion of doctors regarding the legalization of abortion and corroborate how they vary according to the generational belonging of professionals; as well as establishing the role that conscientious objection plays to achieve a balance against the variety of existing positions. We conducted semi-structured interviews to doctors and students about their opinion about abortion legalization and the reasons on which they based their positions. Younger physicians were who approved legalization in greater proportion with arguments offered with a public health perspective. Due to the great variability of positions and idiosyncrasies that coexist in the medical field, conscientious objection is established as a necessary legal instrument to protect the moral integrity of each person.",

This survey aims to analyze how physicians and medical students perceive the end of life. The study was characterized as a data survey, with a descriptive and quantitative approach. The data were organized into two categories for analysis: perception of death; and the influence of the medical experience in facing patient death. The results show that students feel unprepared to face this reality and that the professional experience is the main modifying factor of the doctors' understanding of the death. It is concluded that thanatology and its unfoldings are part of an academic gap in medicine, and the confrontation of death is a painful issue for professionals.

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the medical knowledge regarding the application of the diagnostic criteria for brain death and to correlate it with training parameters for this diagnosis according to Federal Council of Medicine resolution 2,173 of 2017. Method: We interviewed 174 physicians with experience with comatose patients. A structured questionnaire adapted from previous studies was used. The associations of the variables were tested using the chi-square test for independence. A multivariate logistic model was fitted for associations with p values ≤ 0.20. Results: Among the interviewees, 40\% had been working for more than 1 year in intensive care, and 23\% had initiated ten or more brain death protocols complying with the new resolution. Forty-five percent of the interviewees reported having difficulty following the criteria, 94\% acknowledged the need for complementary tests for diagnosis, and 8\% of them reported the existence of incorrect tests. The difficulty with these criteria decreased with an increase in the number of years of medical training (OR = 0.487; p = 0.045; 95\%CI 0.241 - 0.983) and with a higher number of initiated brain death protocols (OR = 0.223; p = 0.0001; 95\%CI 0.117 - 0.424). Conclusions: Difficulties in the application of brain death criteria were identified by a significant portion of the sample. However, among other factors, more years of training and a greater number of initiated brain death protocols were associated with greater ease in the application of brain death criteria according to the guidelines provided in Resolution 2,173 of the Federal Council of Medicine.",

Methods Quasi-experimental, before and after study performed with 56 pregnant women at gestational age between 14 and 37 weeks, who complained of low back pain. Six acupuncture sessions were performed twice a week lasting 30 minutes each and application of systemic and auricular points. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain. Absolute and relative frequency were calculated for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for numerical variables. The tests used for the association were the Wilcoxon for paired measurements, and the McNemar's test. Results There was a significant reduction (p<0.05) in pain index scores. The mean pain score decreased in the evaluation of the second (4.92), fourth (3.24) and sixth (1.00) sessions. For some women, the pain ceased before completing the six sessions and there was improvement in performance of activities impaired by pain. Conclusion Acupuncture provided favorable effects for the health of participants, because their pain reduced after the second session. Nurses can review the quality of care to pregnant women based on the knowledge of techniques that contribute to comprehensive care. The holistic care of clients is part of the essence of nursing, aims at patients' needs and contributes that nurses' actions as Traditional Chinese Medicine professionals are performed in a qualified, efficient and humanized way.",

The diagnosis consists of the observation of the mite in the material analyzed, skin scrapings is the most used method. Other techniques have emerged as less invasive alternatives in the diagnosis of mange, especially for demodicosis in dogs, such as acetate tape and hair removal, which have shown to be as sensitive as skin scrapings in the diagnosis of such dermatopathy. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare skin scaling with two alternative methods for the diagnosis of notohedral scabies in cats: acetate tape and hair collection, and it is possible to conclude that the acetate tape method is as sensitive as skin scraping, both presenting 100\% sensitivity. The hair pulling technique showed significantly lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of Notoedres cati, an expected result, since this parasite inhabits mainly superficial portions of the dermis. Thus, the tape method can be used effectively and safely for the diagnosis of notodroid mange in cats, as well as being less stressful to animals, faster and simpler than skin scraping.",

For this, 120 native wild Passeriformes, received by CETAS/CE were individually evaluated. The isolated strains were submitted to diffusion disc test to determine sensitivity to antimicrobials. In a later stage, PCR was performed for the detection of eight virulence genes from the main E. coli diarrhoeagenic pathogens. Regarding the results, no strain of Salmonella spp. was isolated; however, the occurrence of E. coli was 40.8\%. High resistance was observed, mainly to the antimicrobials Tetracycline, Ampicillin and Sulfazotrim, with multi-resistance in 42.8\% of the strains. By molecular analysis, four of the nine genes were diagnosed, identifying typical EPEC, atypical EPEC, ETEC, EHEC and EAEC. The results point to the importance of Passeriformes as possible disseminators of zoonoses.",

Methods: An observational cross-sectional survey study was performed in 242 students over 12 brazilian states. The project was done by Associação Brasileira de Ligas Acadêmicas de Oftalmologia (ABLAO) with the participation of the associated Academic Leagues of Ophthalmology. The sample was composed by random undergraduate medical students, who have already had Ophthalmology as subject. An individual questionnaire was used with questions about the student profile, basic knowledge of the speciality and perspectives about their teaching. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS program, measuring mean, standard deviation and 95\% confidence intervals. Results: The mean age was 23.96 (3.36±) years and female students were predominant in 63.6\%. 42\% of the states from all regions of Brazil participated. 71.9\% of the students were from private educational institutions and were in the 8th period (±1,97). 43\% were a member of the Academic League of Ophthalmology in the origin institution. Basic knowledge questions had a variation of the correct answers. Despite of only 31\% of the students feel safe to attend or refer patients for evaluation of the specialist, 95.9\% of the students answered that they consider ophthalmology important in their training as general practitioner. Conclusion: We defined in this research a profile for the undergraduate student who attended the Ophthalmology Department. We verify how the student considers eye health important and how they search for more knowledge in his preparation in general. We also found that the Medical Academic Leagues make up the main extracurricular support for their learning. It is important to discuss and implement different teaching strategies to improve their training.",

A completely randomized design was used, with five treatments and seven replicates, the treatments being: 0; 20; 40; 60 and 80\% of inclusion of DBR in the concentrated portion of the ration. The inclusion of DBR in the ration did not influence feeding time (FT; h/day) and feeding efficiency (gNDF/h; P> 0.05). The FT obtained in this study had an average value of 4.90h/day. There was a decreasing linear effect (P< 0.05) for feed efficiency (gDM/h) and rumination efficiency (gDM/h and gNDF/h). However, linear increasing effect (P< 0.05) was observed for rumination and total chewing time, as well as for the number of chews per day for animals fed with the byproduct. The inclusion of dehydrated brewer's residue in the concentrate can influence the ingestive behavior of Santa Ines lambs, reducing feed efficiency, when related to the dry matter intake per hour, and increasing the total rumination time in Santa Ines lambs, it can be added up to 20\% in the concentrated portion of the ration.",

The experiment was conducted at FMVZ - UNESP, Botucatu, with a randomized block design, with the following treatments: natural luminosity, 30\% and 60\% light reduction, with four cuts and three replications. The analyzes were bromatological composition, digestibility, and shearing strength. There was no difference in digestibility between the treatments in any of the cuts, forage quality was influenced by the light intensity levels, and the treatment with 60\% of light reduction produced higher concentrations of crude protein and ash, lower levels of neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose, cellulose and shear strength. According to the studied cuts, the first one had the lowest cut interval and produced superior forage compared with the last one, as it obtained lower fiber content in acid detergent, lignin, hemicellulose, cellulose and consequent lower shear force. Therefore, the reduction of 60\% of luminosity is beneficial to the quality and shear force of the Xaraés palisade grass.",

The forage mass morphological composition of the pasture average daily gain, weight gain per area, stocking rate of the animals were evaluated in summer and autumn, and the climatic variables of systems we evaluated at three different times, and haematological parameters of the animals (n= 60). The forage mass was higher in the ICL treatment and summer (P0.05). Ambient temperature, globe temperature and temperature and humidity index were better in shade treatments and in the morning, providing greater comfort to the animals, and was also confirmed by the lower globular volume of the bovines in ICL (P<0.05). It is concluded that the systems with trees reduce the forage mass but this reduction does not alter the animals' performance in the finishing phase. In addition, ICLFs improve the thermal comfort of the animals, however, this improvement was not enough to favor their performance.",

This study aimed at developing and testing the technique of immunomagnetic separation (IMS) in the detection of C. jejuni in chicken products. Microparticles magnetically connected anti-C. jejuni polyclonal antibodies were used to concentrate C. jejuni before agar seeding. The protocol was compared with the conventional method. C. jejuni was recovered from experimentally contaminated food for both methods, however, when the IMS was used, the presence of contaminating microorganisms in the means of culture was smaller. C. jejuni was isolated from 7\% of samples of food naturally contaminated, using IMS, and 3\% by conventional method. C. coli was isolated from a sample by conventional method, but it was not detected by protocol with IMS. The IMS technique can be used for isolation of C. jejuni in food, offering the advantage of detecting the microorganism in samples from which the isolation is not obtained with the use of the conventional method.",

Costs calculation was based on the methodology proposed by EMBRAPA - CNPSA and IEA - SP. The economic analyzes were carried out as proposed by DAE UFLA and CONAB. It was verified that the cost of labor caused the greatest impact on the economic performance of cores with different governance structures. In all breeding sites via hierarchical governance, even considering secondary revenues, there was a financial loss in the activity. It was concluded that the hybrid governance represented a better economic alternative than the internalization of the broiler production by integrating companies. Thus, it is suggested that integrating companies deplete the production possibilities through an integration contract before investing resources in their own breeding facilities.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The mitral valve myxomatous degeneration (DMVM) is usually diagnosed by echocardiography, however, electrocardiogram (ECG) may suggest specific alterations and aid diagnosis and treatment. Intrinsicoid deflection (DI) is a simple ECG measure that represents the onset of ventricular depolarization and may indicate the presence of overload and hypertrophy in the left ventricle. The objective of this study is to compare previous data on clinical condition and echocardiogram of dogs with mitral endocardiosis and the value of the intrinsicoid deflection from ECG to obtain a concordance relation. The archives of 45 previously examined dogs in the clinical routine of HV-UFPR were selected. The statistic showed a significant difference in groups B1, B2 and C in leads D2, D3, aVF, rV, V2 and V4 (P< 0,05), which allowed to classify them according to the DI size, and this result corresponded to the consensus classification of mitral endocardiosis in dogs at these stages. It was concluded that there is a gradual increase in the value of DI as DMVM progresses, especially in stages B1, B2 and C, associated with left ventricular overload and hypertrophy, so this parameter can be used to classify the disease.",

Among the means of suicide, burns are prominent due to the lesion severity, the high mortality rate, and the severe functional, aesthetic, and psychological damage. Women comprise the majority of patients with a history of attempting suicide and death by burns and represent a vulnerable group that deserves attention. Methods: This retrospective descriptive time-series study was performed in the Burn Treatment Unit at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Brasília, Distrito Federal (DF) between 2010 and 2015. Results: A total of 42 women with a history of suicide by burns, attempted or consummated, were identified; 15 deaths were directly related to the thermal injury. Suicide by burns was the most predominant among patients aged 30 to 44 years was observed, followed by those aged 15 to 29 years. In 64.3\% of cases, the event occurred in the Brasília, Distrito Federal (DF). Alcohol was the most common etiological agent (71.4\%). The average burned body surface area was 34.38\%, and the patients who died presented larger burned areas (59.53\%) than that in those who survived (20.4\%). Conclusion: The data obtained from the Brasília, Distrito Federal (DF) corroborate information from the literature. Despite progress involving the management and treatment of burn patients, prevention remains the best strategy.",

However, there is ample discussion when it comes to aesthetic procedures. Resolution 1621/2001 of the Federal Council of Medicine also defines the objective of a medical act in plastic surgery as an obligation of means. This study evaluated 106 cases between November 2015 and November 2017 to verify whether the decisions of the Judicial Power agree with the Resolution of the Federal Council of Medicine. The number of lawsuits and the percentage of claims granted or denied were quantified, and the opinions of jurists and courts that supported the claims granted were verified. The number of cases in which the judge's decision was related to the opinion of a medical expert was also quantified. Methods: The authors searched the judgment database located on the website of the Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo (SP) for damage related to aesthetic plastic surgery, using the keyword ``Plastic Surgery'' for all actions. Results: A total of 61 claims (58\%) were denied, and 45 (42\%) were granted. In 96\% of cases (102) the judgment was positively related to the expert report. Conclusion: There were 102 cases in which the judgment agreed with the expert reports and only four cases in which the judgment did not agree with the reports. These data show the crucial importance of experts' reports in defining judicial judgments. The analyses of all judgments showed that there were no cases in which the judge considered the Resolution of the Federal Council of Medicine.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The assessment of motor performance in students has been used to identify sports talents. However, there are few studies on this topic, and none in the Sistema Colégio Militar do Brasil (Brazilian Military College System). Objective To evaluate anthropometric, physical motor and maturational indicators, investigate the proportion of motor talents, analyze the relationship between motor talent diagnosis and maturational stage, and compare the profile of student-athletes and non-athlete students of a military college. Methods We assessed 1490 students of both sexes aged 11 to 17 years. A multidimensional battery of tests was applied to assess body size and composition, flexibility, handgrip strength, upper and lower limb explosive strength, velocity, aerobic endurance, and somatic maturation. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and analysis of covariance. Results Students showed greater body size, higher motor performance and slightly advanced biological maturation in comparison to data available in the literature. In addition, cut-off points were created for eight sports-related tests to identify students with significantly above-average results, with 11\% of motor talents being found. It was also found that motor talents were more frequent in biologically advanced students, and that student-athletes had significant differences in comparison to non-athletes, mainly in terms of motor performance. Conclusion The military school students are larger, stronger, more resistant and more biologically mature when compared to the reference values in the literature, and these characteristics are accentuated in student-athletes. In addition, approximately 1 in 10 of the military college students can be considered a motor talent, and this diagnosis is more frequent in students with early maturation.

Some liquid media are commercially available, however, due to the high cost there are difficulties in implementing it in the public health programs of many countries. Objectives: To study the suitability of alternative liquid media for the collection and preservation of samples for cytologic examinations, comparing the results with the conventional Papanicolaou methodology. Material and methods: In this study, 127 different compositions of alternative liquid-based solutions were tested with samples from 10 volunteers for oral cytology and 20 samples from volunteers for cervical cytology. Formaldehyde-isopropanol-phosphate (FIPLIQ) was used to preserve cervical samples prepared and analyzed on the same day and 3, 7, and 15 days after collection, compared with Pap smear. Evaluations on quality and adequacy of cell types, microorganisms or their cytopathic effects, reactive, degenerative and dysplastic cell alterations were performed. Results: Samples processed with FIPLIQ showed results similar to those of conventional Pap smear when analyzing staining cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasm borders, chromatin structure, presence or absence of different types of cell and microorganisms, reparative process, preneoplastic, and neoplastic cell changes; the samples were stored for up to 15 days after collection. Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest that FIPLIQ is suitable for the preparation and preservation of cytology specimens for up to 15 days.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Nine ovine and three caprine with grade II intermittent or permanent rectal prolapse were treated, with the first report in caprine, according to the consulted literature. The clinical history was deeply explored with the clinical evaluation of the livestock. Among the causative factors identified were the inappropriate ventilation with high levels of dust and ammonia in the facilities, which was correlated to the high incidence of pneumonia and cough. The causative factors identified in the patients were overweight, pneumonia and cough, and, less predominately, verminosis and pregnancy. The treatment was based on manual reduction (T1) or rectal amputation (T2), under sacrococcygeal or lombossacral epidural anesthesia, with or without neuroleptic analgesia. The treatments were efficient in all patients; although there was recurrence in two animals, which needed the repetition of the treatment after their delivery to the farm. Based on the cases reported here, it can be concluded that the history and the livestock clinical evaluation are important to identify the primary causes, avoiding relapses. It also concluded that the surgical treatment and the anesthetic protocol used in the patients reported here were efficient and can be applied even under field conditions.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the evolution of histological findings of patients with biliary atresia (BA), emphasizing the progression of fibrosis by comparing the diagnostic liver biopsy to the surgical liver biopsy, performed during Kasai portoenterostomy. Methods: Retrospective study with 51 patients with BA submitted to portoenterostomy, and both diagnostic (DLB) and surgical liver biopsies (SLB). The samples were blindly reviewed by two pathologists. Results: Median age at DLB and at SLB was 69 and 77 days, respectively. The median time between biopsies was eight days. Cirrhosis was more frequent in SLB than in DLB, both according to the Metavir score (p = 0.006) and the Ishak score (p = 0.016). The Metavir score increased one or more points in 29/51 (56.9\%), with evidence of progression to liver cirrhosis in 11/29 (37.9\%) of those who had progression of fibrosis. Median age at surgery of those who had a progression of fibrosis was 77 days, while in those 11 who progressed to cirrhosis, this median was 92 days. Cirrhosis was seen in 12/51 (23.5\%) SLB patients. The clinical variable age at surgery had a statistically significant difference regarding the presence or absence of cirrhosis in SLB (p = 0.024). Cirrhosis was not related to survival with native liver or biliary drainage. Conclusion: Most infants with BA have liver fibrosis at diagnosis and it progresses rapidly. The presence of cirrhosis is correlated with the age at surgery, which suggests the importance of this clinical variable in the evolution of fibrosis.",

After analyzing the data, it was observed that a higher rate of male physicians were reported, and a small number of penalties applied.

In this article, we will analyze the arguments that mobilize the social players who appeal to that right in Argentina. We will compare two phenomena that limit the right and access to health and whose recurrence has increased since the early 2000s: the objection to the National Program of Responsible Sexual Health and Procreation and the National Plan of Compulsory Vaccination. The data analyzed come from three qualitative investigations, focused on the understanding of the views of the social players. We propose that conscientious objection cannot be reduced to a question of individual autonomy, but, on the contrary, it is a phenomenon in which individuals interact as parents, citizens, professionals, among other social roles.",

The originality and relevance of this work lie in the presentation of his articles from the 1970's about medicine and medical ethics, which are unexplored in Bioethics. In these articles, MacIntyre criticizes changes in society transforming the physician-patient relationship: fragmentary moral views, individualism, misunderstanding of scientism and fallibility of the practice, as well as the lost background of common values and medical authority. From a teleological perspective, MacIntyre describes internal goods of medicine and physician's virtues: reliability, fairness, courage, humility and even, friendship.",

Results show a higher rate of correct answers among undergraduates who attended at least one discipline on medical ethics; whereas they indicated an unsatisfactory rate of success in both groups. One third of the undergraduates who did not have contact with the subject revealed that they did not feel put at a disadvantaged by this gap, and 25.6\% of the sample did not value the importance of the subject in comparison to other undergraduate subjects.

The cells were extracted from the dental pulp of two canine cadavers, with approximately ten months of age, which died due to automotive trauma. After three subcultures, cell viability evaluation was performed by Neubauer chamber quantification. Neural differentiation was induced in neurobasal culture medium (Gibco ™), with cells adhered to the plastic or suspended in agarose-treated plates. After seven and 14 days in inducer culture, morphology and immunophenotypic profile were observed using flow cytometry and fluorescent immunocytochemistry. At 14 days the cells had a high degree of expression for anti-nestin and anti-glial fibrillary acidic (anti-GFAP) markers. Previously, an average of 18x10⁶ undifferentiated viable cells from the pulp tissue were obtained on the 25th day. It is suggested that the undifferentiated canine pulp stem cells present satisfactory differentiation indices in neural progenitor cells, adhered or suspended in culture. The dental pulp of deciduous canine teeth provides viable undifferentiated cells in adequate quantity.",

Forty ovine femurs (Ovis aries) were used and 40 acrylic plates were prepared and evaluated in groups: In the OP Group, 20 fractured bones reduced with 20 acrylic plates were evaluated; in the PS Group, 20 acrylic plates were evaluated; and in the OS Group 20 intact and fresh bones were evaluated. All were submitted to mechanical tests of compression, bending, twisting and traction in an EMIC® 10000 universal testing machine. The tests were interrupted when the body of proof was fractured. The PS group supported a significantly higher compression load than the other OP and OS groups (13,255±290 N, 4,932±827 N and 8,681±303 N, respectively). Regarding the flexural test, the OS group was significantly more resistant, with a mean of 2,698±305 N, compared to the groups OP and PS that obtained 1,315±92 N and 1,537±37 N respectively. It is concluded that the laser-machined acrylic plates have inferior mechanical resistance to the femur of the ovine, however, due to the presented resistance, it shows potential to be implanted in bones with lower load demand.",

Here we report an uncommon case of abortion by T. pyogenes in a cow. An aborted female Brahman bovine fetus, at 8 months of gestational age was submitted for anatomopathological examination and complementary diagnostic tests. Macroscopic findings at necropsy included large amounts of free serum-blood fluid and moderate fibrin deposition covering both the visceral pleura and pericardial sack. The lungs were diffusely reddened and markedly consolidated, showing widespread smaller than 1cm, hard, white nodules. Necrosuppurative pneumonia, fibrinopurulent pleuritis, and purulent placentitis were the main histopathologic alterations observed. Trueperella pyogenes was isolated from liver, lungs, abomasa contents and placental samples. All tissue samples were PCR-negative for Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Although T. pyogenes is often involved in suppurative bronchopneumonia and abscesses formation, macro and microscopic lesions in the present report were compatible with those commonly attributed to Brucella abortus fetal infections. Trueperella pyogenes is an important bovine pathogen with a neglected zoonotic potential being responsible for infections that can mimic other diseases' typical presentations.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT In a recent study with young females (up to 5 years old) of the Campolina breed, there were discrete indications of alterations in the digit, apparently associated to the increase in adiposity. With the hypothesis that this association is more evident in horses in the upper age group, the objective was to study Campolina adult mares (above 5 years) with and without obesity, evaluating radiographically the spatial relationship between the horn and distal phalanx. Eighteen mares between six and fourteen years and with a body score of 5 to 7/9 (Control Group) and 8 to 9 (Obeso Group) were used. Adiposity and radiographic measurements from the forelimbs were analyzed. Comparisons were made between groups and adiposity variables were correlated with hoof variables. The sinking distance of the distal phalanx was about 20\% higher in obese mares (12.3±2.5 versus 10.2±2.2mm). This parameter also correlated (P< 0.01) with several adiposity parameters, with emphasis on body score condition (r= 0.47) and neck circumference at 75\% (r= 0.42). In conclusion, Campolina mares with obesity have obvious alterations in the spatial relation between the corneal and the distal phalanx, which get intense according to increases in age and adiposity.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate the latency, duration of the effect, and cranial progression of lidocaine and bupivacaine alone or in combination, by epidural route in dogs, and measuring the average pressure of the epidural channel before and after the completion thereof. Eighteen dogs were allocated in three groups, which received epidural: lidocaine 2\% (GL) 0.25ml / kg; bupivacaine 0.5\% (GB) in the same volume, or the association of both (GLB) in a 1: 1 ratio. Heart and respiratory rates and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were evaluated before treatment (M0) and up to 60 minutes after epidural anesthesia. In addition, the pressure in the epidural canal was evaluated before and after the administration of the treatments, latency period, progression and duration of the block by interdigital and paravertebral pannicus clamping. There was a 12\% decrease in SBP in the GL at all times and 16\% at 30 minutes in GLB when compared to the baseline. The mean pressure in the epidural space before and after epidural anesthesia was -1.5 (±3.9) and 41 (±16) mmHg), 55\% presented negative pressure in the epidural space. The latency period did not differ between groups (GL: 3.5±1.6; GB: 4.5±4.5; and GLB: 2.4±1 minutes) and the duration of blockade was higher in GB (GL: 125±24, GB: 176±24, and GLB: 153±35 minutes). The maximum progression of anesthetics was up to L1-T13 in GL, L4-L3 in GB and L3-L2 in GLB. It is concluded that the association of lidocaine with bupivacaine does not present advantages in relation to the use of the drugs isolated by the epidural route, with lidocaine progressing more cranially in relation to bupivacaine or the association. Lidocaine promoted the reduction of SBP, even when associated with bupivacaine, remaining within the reference values. Only 55\% of the dogs presented negative mean pressure in the epidural space before administration of the drugs, so the drop test may not be efficient for locating the epidural space in all animals.",

Method: This is an analytical, quantitative and predictive study. Mews' parameters (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and level of consciousness) were evaluated every six hours. The following events were reported: death, cardiopulmonary arrest and transfer to intensive care. The evaluations were performed in a hospital of reference in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Results: A total of 300 patients were included (57 ± 18 years old, males: 65\%).

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Community-Based Education (CBE) in the context of teaching health professionals is not a new concept, since its origin dates back to the 1970s, but over the years the way in which CBE is applied in medical education has undergone transformations. In Brazil, since 2001, CBE has been incorporated into the curricular guidelines of undergraduate courses in the health area, and more recently in 2014 in the publication of the new guidelines of undergraduate courses in medicine. Objective The purpose of the present research is to ascertain the senses and meanings that teachers attribute to Community-Based Education in the curricular matrices in force in the medical training offered at UNICEPLAC in 2016 and to identify rooms for improvement in the teaching at the institution in line with the national guidelines. Method A qualitative study conducted at the Centro Universitário do Planalto Central Apparecido dos Santos (UNICEPLAC). The data were collected through a reflective interview with 13 teachers who are or were directly connected to CBE promoted at this institution in the year 2016. The method of data analysis was the Bardin Content Analysis, using Atlas-ti 7 software for analysis support. Results The results show that most teachers state that they are familiar with the concept of CBE, but their understanding of the concept often diverges from the literature. They also indicated failures in the workload, teacher-teacher relationships and teachercoordination relationships, in planning and the provision of adequate scenarios for CBE-related subjects, as well as macro-political challenges concerning the applicability of CBE in practical settings of the Unified Health System (SUS). These results were related to the bureaucratization of partnerships and to a lack of accountability shared between teacher, educational institution and State. Conclusion As CBE has gradually been incorporated in medical education, institutions also have an increasing need to transform and adapt to current curricular guidelines. It is suggested that permanent faculty training on the understanding and application of the CBE be implemented, as well as the creation of a sector or appointment of a dedicated role for the institutionalization, formalization and maintenance of the scenarios, highlighting primary care scenarios in the SUS. It is also essential to instruct the students on the subject so they can understand the applicability of CBE, its importance in medical education and its contribution to improving the quality of life of the population.",

Raising the theme of ethical problems in medical education entails using a possible artifice to contribute toward understanding the diverse needs of the Brazilian population. The objective of this study is to analyze the ethical problems experienced by the students and professors of the University of Vale do Itajaí (Univali) medical course. This is a qualitative study. The study participants were students from the 1st to 7th semesters of the medical course and the institution's teachers. Data were collected through focus groups with the students and a collective interview with the teachers. The collected data were coded and categorized for content analysis. The students think that tackling ethical problems in medical education equates to the need to learn to deal with themselves and spread debate and study of ethics at the medical school. The teachers believe that ethical problems should be addressed through the following actions: (1) empowering the students to stand up to repressive forces; (2) strengthening collective decision-making practices within institutional spaces; (3) continuing teacher training; (4) giving value to teachers with a foundation based on planning and collective actions and linked to the National Curricular Guidelines of the medical course. The identification of knowledge about the subject reflects the inseparable relationship between the knowledge of teachers and students and the institutionalization of medical education in relation to ethical problems. These are present throughout all the academic periods of the medical course analyzed, although they are not always cited or visible, and are therefore, directly or indirectly, cross curricular disciplines and spaces of practices. The research participants identify the incongruities in the training with discrepancies between theory and practice, from teacher-student relations to the relations between the institution and teacher/student.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Health care has become increasingly complex and new needs demand that people readjust their work processes towards the construction of multi-professional teams that assure users comprehensive, effective, high quality care. The Association of American Medical Colleges has recommended that medical curricula seek strategies for collaborative development, shared responsibility, and high-performance teams characterized by leadership, decision-making, communication, conflict resolution, self-knowledge, cooperativity, co-responsibility, and commitment. Accordingly, the National Curriculum Guidelines for Medical Undergraduate Courses states that the student must be able to take leadership in interpersonal relationships with commitment, responsibility, empathy, ability to make decisions, communication and perform effective actions, mediated by interaction, participation and dialogue, aiming at the community's well-being. One strategy to produce teams and develop teamwork skills is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), widely used in the human resources, management and administration sectors in team building, with the purpose of self-knowledge and self-development, organizational development, managerial training, and academic and professional curriculum development. Thus, the MBTI was incorporated into the planning and execution of a Public Health discipline, in the seventh semester of a Medicine course of a Brazilian Federal University, as a strategy for the division of working teams during the academic period. The objective of the present article, therefore, is to report the experience and to perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis based on student answers obtained in questionnaires. Following application of the MBTI test, teams were formed according to the students' temperament, with the sixteen psychological types divided into four large groups of temperaments: SJ (guardians), SP (craftsmen), NF (idealists), NT (rational). The teams were created so that they each had at least one representative of each temperament. The quantitative analysis shows that the intervention was statistically significant. Qualitative analysis of the answers to the open-ended questions was obtained initially by categorization of the information, followed by grouping into broad categories, through content analysis. The categories ``satisfactory team formation'', ``opportunity for self-knowledge and peer knowledge by the MBTI'', and ``disagreement with the MBTI division'' elucidated the students' perceptions about the potentialities and challenges of using the MBTI for team division in medical training. The experience taught us that adding individual skills is possible and important, not only for the construction of quality end products, but for the work process to be valued, allowing self-knowledge and the development of interpersonal skills. It is evident that we, as students and teachers, health professionals and people, should allow ourselves to be affected by the transformative potential of the educational process in order to enable us to act as agents that promote change.",

The objective of this research was to analyze the behavior reported by medical students of a higher education institution with active learning methodology regarding access to academic information, as well as opinions about the construction of academic knowledge during undergraduate training. A cross-sectional and analytical observational study was conducted with 274 students from the Pernambuco Health College Medical School in Recife, Pernambuco. A specific questionnaire was prepared and validated for the data collection, and subsequently analyzed descriptively using absolute and percentage frequencies for categorical variables and measurements. To evaluate the association between two categorical variables, Pearson's Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used. The research project was approved by the ethics committee and respected all ethical requirements. Among those surveyed, 52.8\% used electronic media alone, while 37.7\% indicated that they handled both electronic and print media and 9.4\% cited print media alone. In relation to the forms of study with which the student most identifies, the options confirmed by the majority were ``online books (PDF, Word, Epub, etc.)'' and ``paper books'' (81.9\% and 68,3\%, respectively). Regarding questions about the use of electronic databases in their study routine, the majority (67.9\%) responded positively to the statement; the most commonly cited databases included SciELO (86.7\%), and PubMed (70.6\%). When evaluating access to scientific information among medical students, it was seen that, although most students used electronic databases in their academic routine, more than half had not received training related to bibliographic research techniques; most had learned with practice. Almost all the students surveyed agree on the importance of evidence-based practice in academic routine, which is reported by more than half of the students who, when they do not seek information online, feel less up-to-date.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The introduction of the arts into the medical curriculum has sparked increasing interest since they present unique qualities that can aid in the development of the social aspects of medical practice, offering new and distinctive ways of exploring knowledge and professional identity. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of the use of the arts in the medical curriculum, through a bibliographical review. Methodology The Lilacs, Scielo, PubMed and Eric databases were searched for published articles on studies that attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of an arts-based approach in undergraduate medical education. Other articles were identified through active searching. The following descriptors (art or visual arts or paintings or literature or narrative or poetry or theatre or movies or films or cinema) AND (medical education or medical student or medical curriculum) were used. We included only articles related to studies that were conducted with medical students and which evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention by comparison between groups (quantitative studies) or by medical student satisfaction by questionnaire (qualitative studies). The selected articles were read in full in order to identify the type of art used in the intervention, the author, the sample, the methodology and the conclusion about the reported activity. Results A total of 28 articles were included in the study, distributed according to the type of art used: (n = 16) visual arts; (n = 6) literature; (n = 3) theater; (n = 3) cinema. The arts-sensitive educational skills reported in the studies evaluated were: skills diagnostic observation, teamwork, reflection and argumentation; facilitating cognitive learning; humanistic aspects of medicine (empathy / patient medical relationship); professionalism. Some studies state that arts-based interventions are effective at changing attitudes; however, they did not define how this success was measured. No study considers the effects on behavior. Evidence for the use of arts-based interventions to promote diagnostic observation skills has been shown to be stronger. However, its effect on other clinical skills has not been studied. Conclusion Art can represent a strategy to facilitate learning, since it helps the student to deal with human complexity and health. This broader understanding of health and illness can lead to improved physician-patient relationships in clinical practice. However, due to the qualitative nature of most of the studies, based mainly on the student's opinion of the changes in their attitudes, the effectiveness of the interventions has not always been effectively demonstrated.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Inadequate nutritional habits are considered a leading risk factor for the development of chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNCD). The physician plays an important role in modifying and improving the nutritional behavior of his patients and consequently safeguarding their health. In this context, it is necessary to measure, through reliable instruments, the attitude of students and physicians toward nutrition in patient care, to subsidize educational interventions that will impact clinical practice. Objective To translate, culturally adapt and validate the Nutrition in Patient Care Survey (NIPS), which assesses attitudes in nutritional care in clinical practice, to be used in the Portuguese-speaking population in Brazil. Methodology The original English version of NIPS was initially translated into Portuguese and submitted to a cross-cultural adaptation of vocabulary and linguistic construction. This version was then retranslated into English. The questionnaire was then applied to pre-test in 30 medical students, in order to eliminate doubts about comprehension of the questions. The final version of the adapted instrument was applied to 400 medical students. The reliability and validity of the survey was ascertained using exploratory factor analysis, conducted through principal component extraction and Varimax rotation methods. Result Four hundred students answered all NIPS questions and were included in the analysis. Following factorial analysis, the final structure of the scale was defined, which now has 37 items, in Likert form ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree), divided into ten factors, which differs from the original scale with five factors. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the ten factors studied was greater than 0.60 in most cases and the general alpha was greater than 0.50. In the construct validity analysis, the majority of the correlation coefficients were significant (p values < 0.005). With this structure, the proposed scale presented an internal consistency understood as favorable, explaining 58.93\% of students' attitudes regarding nutritional care in patient care. Conclusion The version in Portuguese of the NIPS instrument, after an adaptation process, proved to be useful and adequate for gathering information regarding the attitude of medical students related to nutritional care of patients.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction The current global, and more recently Brazilian, state-of-affairs, indicate that Medicine courses are lacking in disciplines that address the issues of death, grief and communicating bad news. These are themes generally inserted in the context of palliative care, although not exclusively in subjects that instruct future medical professionals beyond technical-scientific knowledge, bearing in mind the need of patients and relatives to be cared for in psychosocial and spiritual terms1. There are known barriers for the application of palliative care methods in Brazil. These include a lack of training in palliative care among health care staff, and specifically in this study, medical professionals. Objectives To identify the level of knowledge in Palliative Care among sixth-year medical students at a Medicine school in the state of Goiás, Brazil, understand their view of training in Palliative Care during the undergraduate medical course and, finally, discuss the inclusion of Palliative Care in the medical training offered at their school and throughout Brazil Method A questionnaire containing 9 questions was applied to assess the level of knowledge about Palliative Care among sixth-year medical students from a Medicine school in the state of Goiás, Brazil. The study population was formed by 81 individuals, of both sexes, all of whom were at least 18 years of age. Results It was found that 73.84\% of the interviewees were able to define orthothanasia, 43.07\% gave a correct definition of dysthanasia and 58.73\% correctly described euthanasia. Nonetheless, 36.92\% of the students did not deem themselves fit to deal with terminality, and 74.3\% cited a lack of attention given to the theme during undergraduate training. Conclusion Although the assessed students knew some principles of palliative are, these are insufficient. The students allege a lack of attention given to the theme, emphasising the need to implement Palliative Care as a mandatory discipline in the Brazilian curriculum.",

Objective It was to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative results of laboratory tests ordered in the outpatient clinics of Cardiology and Endocrinology of the Hospital of the Ribeirão Preto Medical School-USP. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out. An analysis of the exams was performed in outpatient clinics in the endocrinology and cardiology between July/2012 and July/2013. Results The number of tests was similar over the 12 months, and the examination/patient relationship was higher in the cardiology clinic with 10.36 versus 5.91 observed in endocrinology clinic. Besides that, it was observed the sub-elements of the tests, which demonstrated similar results: in Cardiology average rate of change elements was 20.79\%, whereas in endocrinology, the average was 22.39\%.

The collected data were analyzed according to the Collective Subject Discourse (DSC) methodology applying the resources of central ideas and key expressions. We verified that people with hypertension are identified by the subjects when they seek medical attention for different purposes: medical examination for complaints not related to hypertension, health check-ups, emergency situations, referrals from other professionals or even complaints that the person attributes to hypertension. The medical teachers identified a lack of association between hypertension and symptoms, attributing that association to those afflicted with hypertension, even though the subjects talked of hypertension more like as a disease, than a risk factor. Poor treatment adherence emerged as a limitation of non-pharmacological measures as much as of the pharmacological ones, pointing to the difficulties involved in justifying the lifestyle modifications usually prescribed to deal with a risk factor that is not identified as an illness when there are no associated complications defining disease situations. We suggest the importance of adequately defining hypertension as a risk factor throughout medical undergraduate training, in order to avoid disease mongering.

The diagnosis and measurement of learning strategies has become a key aspect in the improvement of the teaching and learning process. Objective The study aims to identify students' strategies in developing their self-directed learning, evaluating the application of useful tools in the context of their learning. Methods A descriptive and analytical observational cross-sectional study was carried out, applying 348 questionnaires to the students of a medical school, uniformly distributed from the 2nd to 9th semesters of the course. The Likert-scaled questionnaires were aimed at investigating the strategies used for individual study as well as student perception regarding learning. Statistical analysis was performed by different methods, according to the variables and categories observed and executed with the aid of BioStat 5.45 software. Results with p ≤ 0.05 (bilateral) were considered significant. Results The mean age was 22.7 years, with 57.3\% being female. The majority showed a study habit higher than three times a week (72.2\%), in fixed places, especially in the library (96.8\%). Most of the students have electronic resources to access the internet. Most of the respondents (43.6\%) use the video-lecture feature infrequently. 50\% of the students find it easy to follow scheduled study hours and avoid situations that distract their attention. 50\% of them studied all proposed learning objectives alone, and kept their focus. The use of the conceptual map is not frequent. However, most developed schemes during study. The majority of the students conducted searches for scientific articles in the English language only 50\% of the time. Only 25\% of the students «always» synthesize the study in summary form. At least 25\% of the students used more than one textbook in their studies and `always' accessed articles through scientific database platforms. Regarding the use of commercial e-books and non-self summaries, up to 75\% of the students answered that this happens approximately 50\% of the time. Regarding self-perception of knowledge retention, for 50\% of the students the answers varied between this happens «about 50\% of the time» and «very frequently''. Conclusion The medical students using PBL methodology, use appropriate resources for their study, planning and organizing their learning, however there have been failures in learning strategies. A habit of planning study is positively associated with the best learning strategies and the search for sources of better technical quality, resulting in a greater perception of student retention of knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that self-learning guidelines be created to assist the student in his or her study performance.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Historically, there is stigma associated to several diseases. There are widespread stigma and prejudice regarding mental illness throughout the world and research has shown that the general population has limited knowledge about mental illness. One mental disorder in particular, schizophrenia, is highly stigmatized. As members of society, medical students are not immune to stigma assigned to people with mental disorders. Several studies have suggested that the psychiatric training, especially when involving direct contact with the patient, such as medical internship, can have a positive impact on the medical student through their direct engagement in patient care, interest in participating in other activities such as therapy group management, case management, and gaining an understanding that patients with psychiatric conditions can be treated successfully. Most doctors, however, receive little training when interacting with mental illness patients. They usually feel uncomfortable or ineffective in communicating with them, even regarding physical complaints. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the internship in a psychiatric hospital in Fortaleza reduces the stigma of medical students in relation to mental illness. AQ-9 validated questionnaire was applied to medical students in the initial period of the internship in psychiatry and repeated at the end of the period. From a total sample of 88 students, 37 (42\%) were male and 51 (58\%) were female, and the mean age was 24.68 years. There was a noticeable difference between the first three domains of AQ-9, which showed a significant decrease in pity (p = 0.029), danger (p = 0.004) and fear (p < 0.001). Stigma does seem to reside in the student population analyzed and the psychiatry internship of the two medical schools studied significantly reduced the results in three of the 9 domains evaluated. Of the sociodemographic variables, only gender influenced the result. Female students presented higher scores than male students in relation to the fear domain while male students presented a higher average than their female counterparts in relation to segregation. The importance of the psychiatry internship which goes beyond technical learning is reinforced, since it has the capacity to reduce stigma in relation to psychiatric, and especially schizophrenic, patients.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction Clinical Relationship (CR) is a more comprehensive term than doctor-patient relationship and is currently used to describe the health team's contact with the patient and their families, as well as the team's interaction with each other. To establish satisfactory interpersonal relationships, it is important to bring together communication and empathy skills that play a key role in building the CR. However, such topics are given little attention during medical training, with a more focused study on diseases and treatments. Rigid protocols and guidelines have accounted for a large proportion of undergraduate medical curricula, leaving less time for discussion of more abstract subjects related to the humanities and the subjectivity of patients, a view that is part of people's reality. Objectives To provide spaces and theoretical references for the discussion of topics less addressed in the medical curriculum and to encourage the importance of communication and empathy in health/disease processes. Methods In view of the importance of providing medical students with humanizing experiences, we have proposed theoretical-practical workshops and conducted a qualitative research in order to evaluate the students' views on learning about CR themes. In total, 33 second-year medical students participated in the project, by voluntary adhesion in response to an invitation distributed via electronic mail. Six theoretical-practical workshops were offered and executed in small groups and addressing topics such as: empathy, mourning, palliative care, end of life and communication of difficult news. The data collection methods were two focus groups conducted at the end of the six meetings encounters and participant observation, the notes from which were taken in a field diary. Results Content analysis (Bardin, 2011) was the method chosen to study the results, following transcription and analysis of the speech of the groups. At the end of the analysis, four main categories (and five subcategories) emerged, of which two are highlighted in this article: ``Art, cinema and literature evoke feelings: seeking humanism'' and ``Difficult news in the view of patients – the living experiences''. To this end, we used active methodologies such as small group work, use of videos and excerpts from films, music, reports, reading texts and conversation wheels. Conclusion The participants' statements showed satisfaction with the proposed theme and methodologies. We therefore evaluated the use of such techniques to sensitize students, leading them to reflect on the importance of empathy and communication in the work of physicians and health staff, developing interpersonal skills.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), a piece of national heritage achieved at the VIII National Health Conference, is recognized by the 1988 Federal Constitution. The same Constitution that approved the creation of the system, also required a democratic horizon for health training in Brazil to be developed through teaching, research and community outreach activities. That required horizon became feasible (and remains constitutionally valid) due to art. 207 of the Federal Constitution that determines that universities fulfill the principle of being inseparably linked to the three education modalities. This article analyzes the ethical, political and epistemological features of the interpersonal relations experienced within the Sérgio Arouca Project from the perspective of Medicine students from the University of Vale do Itajaí (SC), Brazil. The Sérgio Arouca Project was designed in 2009, inspired by the Rondon Project. It has community outreach characteristics and its objective is to afford Medicine students the opportunity to be immersed in the social context of primary health care services in socially disadvantaged territories in the state of Santa Catarina. This research is a qualitative, exploratory, analytical social study. Combining teaching, community outreach and research, it was developed by seven academic students using focus group and field diary methods. The findings demonstrated that interpersonal relations developed in the context of the Project were pervaded by applied ethics, dialectic epistemology and responsive political action with oneself and with other members of the group. Thus, the Project was considered a respite, decelerating processes and valuing education outside the everyday epistemological, curricular structure and thereby presenting the opportunity to experience encounters and reflect on the fundamental values for building interpersonal relationships in medical care, where love is revealed as the underlying matrix-value of an ethics with the power to substantiate the political action of good clinical practice. It was concluded that the interpersonal relationship that Medicine requires for Brazil is an inter-people relationship in dialogue with the context of the cared person; a relationship, especially in primary care, with the macro context of the reflections that will be presented here.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT The health care model based on the Family Health Strategy, created in the early 1990s, encouraged changes in health education, highlighting the need to create lato and stricto sensu postgraduate courses aimed at empowering professionals that foster comprehensive health care. Periodic evaluations are carried out and encouraged by Capes/MEC in order to maintain the quality of postgraduate courses, but evaluations of recently-introduced professional master's degree courses in family health remain scarce. Objectives To describe the academic profile, contribution, motivations and expectations of graduates of a Professional Master's in Family Health. Method Cross-sectional and quantitative study to analyze the results of 102 questionnaires answered by graduates of the Professional Master's Degree in Family Health of the Estácio de Sá University (RJ), who had concluded the course between 2007 and 2012. The instrument consisted of open-ended and closed-ended questions, sent by e-mail and made available online through the electronic platform Survey Monkey. The study evaluated age, gender, regional origin, academic background, as well as the contributions, expectations and motivations related to the course. Results The survey sample was formed predominantly by female graduates, aged over 30, from 13 Brazilian states and, mainly from Medicine and Nursing courses. The contribution of the master's degree to the graduate's professional life was evaluated as excellent by 77\% of the interviewees. The expectations regarding the course were positively evaluated and the main reasons for seeking the qualification were scientific-technical improvement and personal satisfaction, rather than better salaries or job stability. Conclusion The course was evaluated positively by the graduates, having exceeded their expectations and satisfied the interests that led them to it, thus producing changes to their personal and professional life. A longitudinal analysis of the impact of the professional master's degree in the career of graduates will require a sequence of similar studies, as has been stimulated by Capes/MEC in recent years.",

 abstract = "Abstract In the twentieth century, population estimates for the Western Hemisphere (Americas) before the arrival of Colombus ranged from ten million to over one hundred million. This large discrepancy is essential in assessing the role of epidemics in the sharp demographic decline that followed. In fact, there was a demographic collapse of Amerindian populations who lived mainly (but not exclusively) in present-day Mexico and the Andean region during the sixteenth century. The fact that some historians chose to indicate epidemics as a distant and sufficient cause of this population collapse conceals (in the opinion of other authors) a type of ``immunological determinism'' which absolves the Spaniards of responsibility and models ways of addressing health problems that still exist today. This study is based on specific literature and develops the idea that this collapse can be understood by combining ``distant causes'' (such as epidemics) with ``near causes'' (such as the violence of the Spaniards and the destruction of Amerindian subsistence and reproductive systems), two categories from evolutionary biology and evolutionary medicine. Our goal is to defend this synthesis, which has already been developed by certain authors, although not in terms of the causal categories we utilize here.",

The information was extracted from the following systems: Sucupira, Ulrichsweb, DOAJ, Scimago Journal Rank and Journal Citation Reports. The results for the profile of the journals were homogeneous among the three medical areas, and demonstrated that they are mainly published by commercial entities with the predominance of the publisher Elsevier; the median of the unified factor (Journal Impact Factor or Cites per Doc) is 5,365; the frequency of publishing is monthly; they are 45 years old; 13\% are Open Access; the predominant country is the United States and that the English language is almost unanimous.

The level and quality of laboratory resources utilization have been frequently questioned. A dissemination of conflicting data regarding the amount of laboratory tests not accessed by the requesting doctors or by the patients themselves is observed, although very often the sources and methodologies used to access these numbers are not properly clarified. Objective: The objective of this study was to obtain data on access to tests results performed in Brazilian private clinical analysis laboratories using the laboratory information system developed by SHIFT Consultoria e Sistemas (Consulting and Systems). Methods: The information was extracted from 81 laboratories, responsible for the performance of 93,240,651 tests, collected from 7,067,087 patients. Results: The total number of tests not accessed, considering all the regions, was 5,071,454, corresponding to a proportion of 5.4\%. Due to the potential risks of adverse events or impacts on diagnostic and treatment management, including the economic impacts due to prolonged hospitalization time, the 17.9\% proportion which was found to correspond to ``not accessed'' tests showing ``abnormal'' results. It is of particular concern, mainly if we observe that from these, 2.5\% were related to ``abnormal'' test results processed by laboratories working in hospital units. Conclusion: Due to the relevance of the theme, Sociedade Brasileira de Patologia Clínica/Medicina Laboratorial (SBPC/ML), will keep encouraging the monitoring and utilization of adequate laboratory resources, in order to enable sustainable health care systems.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Objectives: The development of antibodies (inhibitors) against exogenous factors is the main complication in the treatment of hemophilia. Both genetic and non-genetic factors are related to inhibitor development. Among the genetic factors, the type of mutation that caused the disease is one of the most important. The objectives of the present study were to establish the prevalence of inversions in introns 1 and 22 of the factor VIII gene in patients with severe hemophilia A, correlating these with inhibitor development, and to compare the results with data from the literature. Method: Unrelated severe hemophilia A patients were analyzed for the presence of inversions in intron 1 (n = 77) and intron 22 (n = 39) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Detection of the inhibitor was performed by the mixing test and its quantification was performed by the Bethesda method. Results: The prevalence of inversions in introns 1 and 22 was 2.6\% and 41\%, respectively. No patient with inversions in intron 1 had inhibitors, whereas 26.3\% of patients with inversions in intron 22 developed inhibitors. Conclusion: Due to the small number of patients with inversions in intron 1, it was not possible to perform a statistical test for the correlation with risk of inhibitor development. Inversions in intron 22 of the factor VIII gene were not associated with an increased risk of inhibitor development in the analyzed samples (p = 1).",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is caused by t(15;17)(q24;q21) translocation, which product is the fusion oncoprotein PML-RARa (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha). The morphology of leukemic promyelocytes is usually characteristic, with the presence of faggot cells and coarse cytoplasmic granulations; immunophenotype is characteristic in most cases. However, definitive laboratory diagnosis should be performed by detecting t(15;17) or by PML-RARa fusion protein. Objectives: To compare cytomorphology, flow cytometry, and classical cytogenetic of bone marrow samples from patients with APL, treated at the Complexo Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná (CHC-UFPR), as well as describe the possible discrepancies between the methodologies. Method: Retrospective analysis of APL cases treated at the CHC-UFPR from January 2000 to July 2018. Results: Eighty-eight patients (42 man/ 46 woman; mean age: 34 years), 42.1\% of them presented a high-risk prognosis. Flow cytometry was performed in 83 cases (94.3\%); karyotype was performed in 79 cases (89.7\%), but translocation t(15;17) was confirmed in only 53 cases (60.2\%). From the 28 patients with a non-conclusive karyotype; fourteen (15.9\%) of them presented the PML-RARa transcript in the molecular analysis. In total, 35 patients (39 8\%) performed research of the PML-RARa gene by molecular biology. Only 45 patients (51.1\%) presented concordant diagnosis among the three technical exams (morphology, flow cytometry and cytogenetics). Overall survival was 67\% at 4.8 years, with 29 deaths. Conclusion: Genetic confirmation was observed in 76.1\% of samples, 60.2\% by conventional cytogenetics and 15.9\% by molecular biology. There was a disagreement between the methodologies, and a low sensibility of the conventional cytogenetics, demonstrating the importance of performing molecular techniques for diagnostic confirmation.",

Due to the repetitive movements typical of the surgery, significant friction is generated at the site, and the consequences are skin burns that can leave unsightly scars and dyschromias. This study aims to create a skin protective device prototype from an old model, which serves this purpose, and to observe its functionality and its effects on the pigskin. The tests were carried out on dead animals without suffering provided by the Veterinary Medicine sector at Universidade Positivo. Three incisions were made in the animal's abdomen to pass the liposuction cannula and another three for the insertion and use of the prototype to compare it with the model device. The established time for liposuction movements was twenty minutes, performed with the 5mm cannula directly in contact with the skin and inside the prototype. The prototype's ergonomics, ease of insertion, and good locking on the skin with different tractions were evaluated. Observation and evaluation of the skin were performed after procedures and incisions' measurements (cm). The cutaneous liposuction protective device prototype presented easy handling and a more efficient skin locking mechanism than the model used. The skin incision for using the prototype was slightly larger, and the skin showed no burning signs.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: Several educational methodologies have been used as instructional tools, with the objective of increasing student motivation and promoting meaningful learning. In turn, instruments designed to assess a student's motivation after being exposed to different teaching strategies and materials can play an important role in reviewing the effectiveness of such methods. In this sense, the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) evaluates student motivation after instructional activities, through four domains: attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction. This research aimed to perform the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the IMMS into Brazilian Portuguese. Method: The cross-cultural translation and adaptation was performed in six stages: translation of the original questionnaire; synthesis of translations; back-translation; review by the Committee of Experts; testing of the pre-final version, preparation of the final version and review by the External Committee. The translations were performed by two English teachers, native Brazilian. The back-translations were performed by two English teachers, native English language. The expert committee was formed by a professor of medicine and medical education, two medical professors, a pedagogue, a statistician and an English teacher. The final Brazilian version of the IMMS was tested following a flipped classroom activity aimed at evaluating the internal consistency of the instrument. A Cronbach alpha value of ≥ 0.70 was considered acceptable. Results: In the process of translation and cross-cultural adaptation, all equivalences were achieved: semantic, idiomatic, cultural and conceptual. In the evaluation of internal consistency, of the 52 students submitted to the flipped classroom, 48 (92.3\%) correctly answered the Brazilian version of the IMMS. The instrument presented an internal consistency of 0.718, evaluated using the Cronbach alpha test. Conclusions: The final version of the IMMS instrument, after cross-cultural translation and adaptation, maintained all its 36 sentences and the 3 instructions of the original instrument and presented good internal consistency according to the Cronbach alpha test. The possibility of evaluating motivation in the educational context by means of a broadly validated instrument, brings with it gains both in the field of practice and pedagogical research. Use of the IMMS in Brazil will support new validations in national educational settings and diverse contexts.",

This syndrome comprises three basic dimensions: I- emotional exhaustion; II- increased mental distancing from the work itself or feelings of negativism and cynicism related to the work itself; and III - reduced professional effectiveness. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors for the development and symptoms associated with Burnout Syndrome in medical students from a district college, in addition to establishing a profile of students with a higher risk of having a BS diagnosis. Method: This is a cross-sectional observational study. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - Student Survey questionnaire, specific version for students, which is a questionnaire of sociodemographic factors, one of predictive factors and another of possible somatic symptoms associated with BS were applied. The sample was obtained by convenience and its representativeness was calculated in relation to the total number of students. A student was considered to be at moderate or high risk of developing BS when they had one or two altered BS dimensions, respectively. Results: 67.11\% of the total students regularly enrolled from the 1st to the 6th year of the medical course answered the questionnaires. Of the total sample, 80.63\% of male students and 81.06\% of female students were identified as having a high or moderate risk for BS. The sociodemographic factors associated with the risk of developing BS were: age, who the student lives with, having children and doing paid work. The most statistically significant predictor was the self-management of tasks proposed by the Medical School. Conclusion: The prevalence of high risk and diagnosis of BS found among medical students was 26.44\% and 3.95\%, respectively. Differences were identified between the high-risk profiles for female and male students.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: The work of a family medicine physician requires mastering a broad set of knowledge, skills and attitudes to deal with the complexity of patients, families and communities, with the aim of going beyond a healing perspective. In this context, the internship constitutes a fundamental experience to promote the theoretical and practical coordination of medical education. The objective of this study was to analyze a family practice internship program at a public university in the city of Fortaleza, state of Ceará, from the students' perspective. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive and quanti-qualitative study was developed in August and September of 2018 with 30 undergraduate medical students attending the 12th semester of the course. Data were collected by means of an online questionnaire that assessed the students' perception on preceptorship, learning, theoretical classes, unit infrastructure, overall satisfaction with the internship program and their relationship with other professionals. Quantitative data were submitted to descriptive and thematic content analysis. Most undergraduate students were males, (65.5\%) aged between 22 and 24 years old (55.1\%). Results: Overall satisfaction with the internship was considered good (60\%), as well as with theoretical classes (63.3\%). Learning was assessed as good regarding the physician-patient relationship and communication skills (46.7\%); medical chart recording skills (33.3\%); skills to perform collective activities with users and multiprofessional teams (43\%). A total of 73\% of students reported that the internship program contributed to their future professional performance in primary health care. The positive aspects of the internship program cited were: preceptorship; learning regarding the physician-patient relationship; students' autonomy in case conduction; course study load; getting closer to the reality of the communities; incorporation into the unit's routine; diversity in learning; and theoretical-practical training. The negative aspects were: infrastructure of the primary healthcare unit; learning of collective actions and interdisciplinarity; development of essential activities; evidence-based practice; and preceptorship. Conclusion: In general, the family practice internship program was well assessed by the students, mainly regarding preceptorship, learning clinical skills and the contribution to their medical education for future work in primary health care. Further assessment studies are needed, involving the perception of preceptors and other health professionals, and including an analysis of the educational dimension.",

A longitudinal study was performed with data from the 2015 Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, birth cohort. Gestational weight gain was classified according to the US Institute of Medicine guidelines. Weight retention at 3 and 12 months was calculated according to the mother's weight at each period, subtracting pregestational weight. To identify possible inequalities, the study used Slope Index (SII) and Concentration Index (CIX). The sample included mothers with information on the study's outcome (n = 4,102). Prevalence of adequate gestational weight gain was 33.5\% (95\% confidence interval - 95\%CI: 32.1; 35.0). Slight inequalities were observed in the prevalence of adequate weight gain in mothers with less schooling [CIX = 1.88 (95\%CI: -0.76; 4.52); SII = 4.27 (95\%CI: -0.87; 9.41)] and in mothers belonging to the poorest income quintile- 1st quintile- [CIX = 1.04 (95\%CI: -1.60; 3.67); SII = 2.93 (95\%CI: -2.06; 7.92)], but these differences were not statistically significant.

Results: the analysis of the data allowed for the identification of two categories directly related to the role of nursing and to the power relations between the characters. Yet, although television series are common among nursing students, they have not influenced them in choosing the course. However, the positive perception on the part of some interviewees was related to admiration for the field of human health, but not with the nursing characters represented in the television shows. Conclusion: nursing in health series is not perceived as a leading category in its responsibilities in the care process, but only as an auxiliary group. It is noticed that the media reproduces the biomedical model, emphasizing the medical professional as the central character in clinical care.",

Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of pinus nanocellulose membrane on healing of deep second degree burns in rats and compare with Membracel®. Method: Thirty male Wistar rats were submitted to deep second degree burn in dorse, with boiling water at 97o C for 20 s, generating a 314 mm² area wound. The animals were distributed in three dressing groups (n=10): group 1 - simple gauze; group 2 - bacterial cellulose membrane (Membracel®); and group 3 - pinus cellulose membrane. They were evaluated for 20 days to verify clinical condition, macro and microscopic appearance and wound contraction. Results: All of them remained clinically well with no differences in weight. Crusts were observed in group 1, and none in groups 2 and 3. Regarding to scar contraction, groups 2 and 3 were similar, better than group 1. Microscopic analysis showed predominance of advanced healing degree in groups 1 and 3, and initial in group 2. Mature collagen was predominant in all groups. Conclusion: The pinus nanocellulose membrane is effective in the treatment of experimental second degree burn in rats and its effectiveness is similar to that of the bacterial nanocellular membrane.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: The community outreach program Amigos do Sorriso (Friends of Smiling) is based on the understanding that community outreach programs are part of academic training because they provide experiences that result in exchanges between the students and the society. The participants are undergraduate students from the healthcare field, who develop ludic activities focusing on humanization, health education and the resulting multiplying effects. Since 2010, fortnightly activities have been conducted at an old people's home with the aim of offering playful experiences involving creative and communicative strategies, in order to give new meaning to old age through playing. The objective of this article is to describe these experiences and understand what the medicine students have learned from them. Methods: this article presents a qualitative study, based on 13 narratives written between 2018 and 2019 by undergraduate medicine students who were involved in activities at the old people's home. The content was analyzed from a thematic perspective and correlated to the theoretical framework. Results: Three thematic categories were identified: playing with the elderly, handcrafted construction of communication and sharing between generations about aging. The participants discussed the different forms of play, its relations with health promotion and the specific characteristics of developing Ludic activities with the elderly. Through play they were also able to explore various forms of communication: talking, listening, sharing stories, and respecting the moments of silence, that led to agreement and disagreement. Finally, they discussed the aging process, elderly heath, elderly people in care and the contact itself between generations, allowing the students to reflect on themselves. Conclusions: The activities in the old people's home enabled the students to appreciate the potential that strategies of play offer in terms of promoting autonomy and health, without infantilizing the elderly. It allowed them to identify strategies to form closer relationships and ties with the elderly subjects, respecting individual and collective boundaries when sharing stories and feelings with empathy. Hence the highlight of the program was the development of skills, both general and specific for elderly care, among future medics, recognizing that the aging is a process that involves us all.",

This study brings the experience of the first year of activity of a peer mentoring program carried out at a Brazilian medical school. This study aimed to describe the process of peer mentoring with freshmen on the medical course and present the reasons for satisfaction and challenges encountered along the way, as well as suggestions for improving the activity. Method: Qualitative analysis of feedback submitted over the year by seniors, in the role of mentors. The statements were summarized using the Discourse of the Collective Subject method. Results: The mentors performed actions of academic support, personal support and were also hosts of the academic environment. It proved difficult to hold face-to-face meetings, so they were complemented by virtual meetings. Finding a common schedule and maintaining the frequency of meetings were the main challenges. Lack of interest from some freshmen and drying up of demands in the second half of the year generated frustration. On the other hand, the mentors observed the growth of freshmen and their own personal development, expressing feelings of gratitude and satisfaction with the affective bonds created. For the next experiences, the mentors suggested an earlier start for the program, fewer freshmen per group and greater monitoring of the activities by the coordination. Express requests have been made for mentoring to continue in the future. Conclusions: Peer mentoring is a broad activity in the academic, personal and social fields. Freshmen are helped to deal with the uncertainties of starting the course in a safe space where anxieties can be shared. The mentoring relationship is mutually beneficial, and the senior also develops throughout the process. There were difficulties in holding the meetings and improvements are needed in order to engage more with the activity and expand its benefits.",

We analyzed publications of the newspaper ``Jornal do Brasil'' about scientific conferences that focused on preventivism in the fight against youth's deviant behaviors, emphasizing homosexuality. Sérgio Arouca's doctoral dissertation structured the main discussions and grounded the analysis of the collected publications. As a result, homosexuals, seen as degenerate since the 19th century, were described as pathological threats to the family, morals and national security; thus, prophylaxis was necessary through medical-preventive recommendations in the school and family environments and through the State's direct political repression.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: simulation based teaching is a powerful tool in medical education, allowing hands on practice under a controlled environment and with repeated maneuvers. Central venous access venipuncture is one of the most frequent procedures carried out in the hospital setting, due to its various clinical indications and, when performed with the help of ultrasonography, the risk of adverse events is minimized. Aim: to develop, to describe and to test a porcine model that simulates the central venous access puncture aided by ultrasonography. Method: a low cost porcine model was developed to train medical students and residents on central venous access guided by ultrasonography. Both students and medical residents underwent a theoretical training regarding the model, followed by a hands-on training session. Afterwards, the participants assessed the model by answering a questionnaire. Results: there were 51 participants. The average score regarding the similarity between the model and the human anatomy was 9.15. When the characteristics were separately assessed, the mean scores regarding the similarity of the vessels, anatomic disposition and ultrasonographic characteristics as well as the venipuncture were, respectively, 9.27; 9.31; 9.54 and 8.86. Conclusion: The model was approved and considered appropriate for the training of central venous venipuncture by all the participants. Furthermore, it is a low cost, simple and reproducible model, that presents high similarity with the human anatomy. Therefore, it may be used as an aid to train people on ultrasonography guided central venous access.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: Considering an integrated curriculum that is guided by dialogical competence according to the National Curriculum Guidelines, the Systematized Educational Unit (UES) and the Professional Practice Unit (UPP) constitutes the curriculum of a medical course in a municipality in the countryside of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is used in the UES and the problematization is used in the Professional Practice Unit as teaching methodologies, seeking an organization that leads to a training that is coherent with the public health sector and the national education scenario. The UES is the focus of this study because we observed that there are divergences among teachers regarding their role as tutors. Thus, we observed that the teaching methodology currently employed at Famema led us to some questions: Do the teachers consider themselves qualified to work with the PBL method? How do evaluations contribute to the teaching-learning process? Thus, this study aimed to analyze the teachers' understanding of their ability to work with the PBL and the relevance of evaluations for the teaching-learning process in the UES. Method: This is an exploratory-descriptive study with a qualitative approach. Data collection was carried out using a semi-structured interview with teachers who work with the 1st to 4th years in the UES of the medical course, and the selection of the participants was carried out from a non-probabilistic sample of intention, totaling 16 teachers, including four teachers of each of the first four years of the course. The analysis of the data was performed by Content Analysis in the thematic modality, which allowed the definition of two thematic axes: Challenges for teacher training and Potentials and limits of the implemented evaluation process. Results: The trajectory of the PBL in the teaching-learning process from the point of view of teachers showed us a variety of understandings. As for teacher training, weaknesses were identified in the development of the tutoring process, and that the strategies used for training need to be reviewed regarding their implementation and the inclusion of the professionals into the process. Regarding the evaluation, it was observed that the teachers demonstrate difficulties in carrying out an evaluation of the students while integrating the affective, cognitive and psychomotor dimensions. Conclusion: Therefore, regardless the time of the curriculum implementation, Permanent Education should constitute a powerful space for teacher training and process management.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: Program assessment is the process of data collection about a course or teaching program that takes into consideration the aspects of cost-effectiveness, checking the adequacy of the evaluation according to the course purpose and the program capacity to yield changes in real life. Such regular assessments provide feedback to the decision-making process that aim at better teaching and learning practices. The Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (MiniCex) is a performance rating scale designed to assess the skills that medical students and residents need in real-life situations with patients. Considering the importance of program assessment for an institution, the utilization of the MiniCex data might be of great value for the follow-up of students and the course, helping the planning process and generating improvements in the institution. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the program using MiniCex in the beginning of the medical internship, aiming to determine in what areas of the basic and pre-clinical course the students have more difficulties. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out, using the retrospective data obtained by the MiniCex forms that were applied to the 9th-semester medical students, which correspond to the first semester of medical internship in the Federal University of Pará. A total of 111 students was assessed, among the 154 students eligible for internship, from August 2017 to July 2018. Results: Among the performed evaluations, with 97\% being requested by the teachers, most of them (72\%) were about new cases, and 45\% and 38\% had low or moderate complexity, respectively. There was a predominance of musculoskeletal system disorders (27.7\%), followed by the gastrointestinal/hepatology system (14.8\%). Concerning the skills in each domain, the performance was satisfactory in all of them. We observed that 12\% of the students had difficulties in at least one area, followed by 6.3\% of students with difficulties in 2 areas and 4.5\% with an unsatisfactory performance in 3 or more areas. Conclusion: the MiniCex, when applied to internship students, showed to be a source of important and useful information, as part of a program assessment concerning the areas preceding the internship. The analysis of the obtained data was sent to teachers of the pre-internship, internship and course management areas. To the first ones, with the objective of reviewing their programs, detecting where they can intervene and, thus, make changes that aim a better acquisition of basic knowledge by the students and, consequently, improve their performance. To the second ones, to provide an overview of where they will have to focus their programs according to the needs of the medical students who reach the internship. Finally, to the course management, as a guide of what should be supervised by the professionals teaching the semesters that precede the internship.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: Data published in literature point to an increased frequency of psychological distress among medical students. However, the causes or potentially contributory factors for this scenario are not completely understood. Understanding these factors is essential for planning a support service that welcomes, identifies, monitors and, if necessary, guides the student with mental suffering. Methods: We evaluated the pre-university admission mental health treatment report on medical students at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who sought care at the Psychopedagogical Support Center. These data, as well as demographic data and the reasons that led the student to seek the service were obtained from an enrollment form filled out by the student. Results: A total of 87 students (47 males, mean age 23.3 years) were received support from the NAPEM in the year under study. Of those, 42 (48.3\%) were in the first two years of the course, 24 (27.6\%) in the 3rd/4th year and 21 (24.1\%) in the 5th/6th year. Mental Health treatment prior to university admission was reported by 53 (60.9\%) students: 37 (42.5\%) reported the use of psychoactive drugs and 16 reported psychotherapies without the use of medication. Mental Health treatment and medication prior to university admission were significantly more frequent (p = 0.04 and p = 0,04, respectively) among students in the first two years of the course than among those in other years. No statistically significant differences in relation to the average age (p = 0.06), distribution by sex (p = 0.87), origin (p = 0.68) or type of housing in Belo Horizonte (p = 0.96) were found when comparing those who had undergone psychic treatment with those who had not. Anxiety, depression/depressive symptoms and mood swings were reported by 59 (67.8\%) students as reasons to seek help. Problems related to the course were reported by five (5.7\%) students. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that Mental Health treatment prior to university admission may be one of the factors that contribute to the medical student's mental suffering during the course.",

 abstract = "Abstract: Introduction: Learning and teaching methods have changed over time in medical education. Therefore, there is a strong case for investigating the attributes of a model professor in order to formulate new teaching strategies in medical education. This study aimed to ascertain which character traits are viewed in the eyes of medical students and teachers as essential to the profile of a model teacher. Methods: This is a quantitative, cross-sectional study conducted with medical students and teachers of the University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR) School of Medicine. Participants were invited to respond to a questionnaire, developed by the authors, addressing the most important characteristics of a model teacher. The respondents were asked to score each characteristic from 1 to 5 to reflect its respective importance. Results: A total of 418 people were surveyed, of whom 74 were teachers and 344 students. The highest scoring characteristics in both groups were ``Attitude in the teaching environment'' and ``Interaction with students and colleagues'', although teachers placed more value on these attributes (p = 0.03 and p = 0.006 respectively). ``Personality traits'' was the least appreciated by the students (p = 0.02). In the ``Attitude in the teaching environment'' category, facilitating learning and maintaining an ethical attitude with the patient were the most valued characteristics in both groups, although the latter was more appreciated by the teachers (p = 0.001). In the ``Interaction with students and colleagues'' category, the ability to stimulate student participation was considered least important by the students (p = 0.001). Enthusiasm for teaching scored highly in both groups in the ``Personality traits'' category, though teachers tended to give rate it more highly than the students (p = 0.001). The analysis of the ``Professional development'' category showed that, for both groups, involvement in research was the least valued characteristic. Conclusions: These results suggest that not only attributes associated with teaching practice, but also teachers' attitudes in the teaching environment and their interaction with students and colleagues were considered by both groups as important to their identification of a model teacher. They also suggest the necessity for developing strategies to value scientific research and stimulate greater participation of both students and teachers, underlining its importance in medical training.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Automated hematology analyzers are able to produce low platelet counts with great precision and accuracy. However, these analyzers may produce erroneous counts due to the presence of interferences. Therefore, additional methodologies are required to confirm platelet counts, such as blood smear and a direct count, using the Neubauer chamber. Objective: To validate the reliability estimate produced by the G\&S method. Material and method: One hundred and fifty platelet counts were analyzed in the hematology and emergency laboratories of the Hospital Nacional Docente Madre-Niño San Bartolomé, in Lima, Peru, by four methodologies: one optical platelet count (PLTO), one indirect blood smear count (Indirect), and two direct counts (Direct and G\&S). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to compare the groups. Results: A significant difference was observed in the distribution of the four methodologies and, after applying the post-hoc analysis, a similarity between the PLTO and G\&S methods was found. Also, the Direct, G\&S and Indirect methods showed a positive correlation with the PLTO method. The Bland-Altman test demonstrated that the G\&S method presented a high agreement with the PLTO method. Conclusion: The G\&S method is inexpensive, easy to perform, and has demonstrated statistical reliability concerning the automated methodology, and is useful for confirming low platelet counts after a suspected error by the automated equipment or when this device is not available for use.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the major causative agents of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in men and women, but the greatest impact of infection occurs in the reproductive system of women, causing, among other problems, infertility. Objective: To estimate the incidence of C. trachomatis detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in endocervical samples from women in Lages, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Methods: A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted from May to November 2017. Endocervical cell samples were collected from 126 women that receive medical assistance at three primary healthcare units and one gynecology clinic in the city. The samples of endocervical material were evaluated for the diagnosis of C. trachomatis by the PCR technique. Prior to sample collection, a Cancer Information System (SISCAN) standard questionnaire was answered by the participants. Fisher's exact test and chi-square test were used to evaluate the association between infection and the variables of the questionnaire. Results: From the 126 endocervical samples analyzed, 39.7\% were positive for C. trachomatis. The average age of the participants was 31.7 years old. From the 118 women who did not show changes in the cervix, 43 were positive for C. trachomatis, which reinforces the asymptomatic character of the infection. There was no significant association between endocervical infection by C. trachomatis and age, use of contraceptive pill, time of last pap test and signs of STI. Conclusion: The incidence of C. trachomatis infection in the endocervical samples from these women can be considered high, which emphasizes the importance of measures designed to clarify and prevent this important STI.",

 abstract = "ABSTRACT Introduction: The present work evaluated the possible alterations in different hemogram parameters as: total erythrocyte count, hematocrit, leukocyte, and platelet count, against different times of sample storage at refrigerated and room temperature towards the effects of anticoagulants that can affect the variation of laboratory results. Objective: Compare variations in automated hemogram analysis, with blood collected in tubes containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) and tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K3EDTA). Material and methods: A comparative study was carried out on differential leukocyte count and absolute leukocyte count, hemoglobin determination and red blood cell count and platelet count. Therefore, it researches the anticoagulant that brings less interferences in hemogram analysis according to storage, at temperatures from 2°C to 8°C and 25°C (room temperature), and the time window between collection and analysis (4, 6, and 8 hours). These determinations were carried out after homogenization from five to eight inversions using the automated device Sysmex XN-1000TM. Eighteen biological samples of venous blood were collected, used as control, from patients aged 18 and over that did not have any hematologic disease. Results: The results were evaluated through descriptive statistical analysis, and comparison of mean values through the analysis of variance (Anova). In accordance with the results presented, there were not changes in the parameters by refrigerating the sample in the period of 8 hours, except for the platelet count, presenting oscillations when stored under refrigeration from 2°C to 8°C. Conclusion: At room temperature, the parameters mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and hematocrit presented significant statistical differences.",
