To date, there is still a lack of bio-markers and individualized treatment guidelines for mental illnesses. In recent years, machine learning(ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly popular in analyzing complex patterns of neuraland behavioral data for psychiatry. We provide a comprehensive review of ML methodologies and applica-tions in precision psychiatry. We argue that advances in ML-powered modern technologies will create a para-digm shift in the current practice in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and treatment of mental illnesses. Wediscuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight future research opportu-nities in ML.SUMMARYIn light of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), the advent offunctional neuroimaging, novel technologies and methods provide new opportunities to develop preciseand personalized prognosis and diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelli-gence (AI) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry.Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinicalpractice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for thenew role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensivereview of ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advancedmobile technologies in psychiatry practice. We further review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping andcross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We also discuss explainable AI (XAI) and neu-romodulation in a closed human-in-the-loop manner and highlight the ML potential in multi-media informa-tion extraction and multi-modal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in pre-cision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research.INTRODUCTIONMental health issues are an epidemic in the United States and theworld. According to the NationalInstitute of Mental Health(NIMH), nearly one in five American adults suffer from a form ofmental(www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/). According to the Centers for Disease Controlillness or psychiatric disorderand Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed asignificant impact on our lifestyle and considerably elevatedadverse mental health conditions caused by fear, worry, and un-certainty.1 Increased suicide rates, opioid abuse, and anti-depressant usage have been observed in both adults and teen-agers. The diagnosis and treatment of mental health hasimposed a burden to the healthcare system and society.

The goal of precision medicine is to target timelyand accurate diagnosis/prognosis/therapeutics for the individu-alized patient’s health problem and to further provide feedbackinformation to patients and surrogate decision-makers. Recentdecades have witnessed various degrees of successes in preci-sion medicine, especially in oncology3. Traditional diagnoses ofmental illnesses rely on physical exams, lab tests, and psycho-logical and behavioral evaluations. Meanwhile, precision psychi-atry has increasingly received its deserved attention.4,5 Althoughpsychiatry has not yet benefited fully from the advanced diag-nostic and therapeutic technologies that have an impact on otherclinical specialties, these technologies have the potential totransform the future psychiatric landscape.The NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims toillness and provide aaddress the heterogeneity of mentalbiology-based (as opposed to symptom-based) framework forunderstanding these mental illnesses in terms of varying degrees2 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022Reviewof dysfunction in psychological or neurobiological systems; it at-tempts to bridge the power of multi-disciplinary (such as thegenetics, neuroscience, and behavioral science) research ap-proaches.6,7 The current gold standard for diagnosis and treat-ment outcome in mental disorders—the Diagnostic and Statisti-cal Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), maintained by theAmerican Psychiatric Association (APA)—is often based on theclinician’s observations, behavioral symptoms, and patient re-porting, which are all susceptible to a high degree of variability.Therefore, it is imperative to develop quantitative neurobiologicalmarkers for mental disorders while accounting for their hetero-geneity and comorbidity.One important goal in neuropsychiatry research is to identifythe relationship between neurobiological/neurophysiologicalfindings and clinical behavioral/self-report observations. Ma-chine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have generatedgrowing interests in psychiatry because of their strong predictivepower and generalization ability for prognosis and diagnosis ap-plications.8–10 The interest of applying ML/AI in psychiatry hasgrown steadily in the past two decades, as reflected in the num-ber of PubMed publications (Figure 1A). To improve mentalhealth outcomes with digital technologies, the so-called ‘‘digitalpsychiatry’’ focuses on developing ML/AI methods for assess-ing, diagnosing, and treating mental health issues.11 A recentglobal survey has indicated that psychiatrists were somewhatskeptical that AI could replace human empathy, but many pre-dicted that ‘‘man and machine’’ would increasingly collaboratein undertaking clinical decisions, and psychiatrists were opti-mistic that AI might improve efficiencies and access to mentalcare and reduce costs.12The past two decades have witnessed substantial growth ofML applications for psychiatry in the literature, reflected inmany applications and reviews.17–27 Although multiple reviewsof ML for psychiatry are available, the majority of reviews arerestricted to relatively narrow scopes. In this paper, we try to pro-vide a comprehensive review of ML and ML-powered technolo-gies in mental health applications. Our view is ‘‘modern’’ in thesense that the development of new technologies, consumermarket demand, and public health crises (such as COVID-19)have constantly redefined the role of ML and reshaped ourthinking in precision psychiatry. Specifically, we will coverstate-of-the-art methodological developments in ML, multi-modal neuroimaging, large-scale circuit modeling, neuromodu-lation, and human-machine interface. Due to space limitations,our reviewed literature is by no means exhaustive. To distinguishour review from others, we will focus on several issues central tothe ML applications for psychiatry: generalizability, interpret-ability, causality, and clinical and behavioral integration.Our view about this emerging field is cautiously optimistic forseveral reasons. First, with an increasing amount of data andcomputational power, there is a growing demand for psychia-trists to use ML to reevaluate clinical, behavioral, and neuroi-maging data. The interests in mental health funding from the in-dustry have also grown substantially (Figure 1B). Second, it isbecoming increasingly important to leverage the power of MLand develop explainable AI (XAI) tools for unbiased risk diag-nosis, personalized medicine recommendation, and preciseneurostimulation. The integration of ML with neuroimaging canpotentially help us identify and validate biomarkers in diagnosisReviewand treatment of mental illnesses. Third, there is a growing de-mand for psychiatrists in the United States, and the shortage iseven more acute in poorer countries.28 ML/AI technologiesmay change the practice of psychiatry for both clinicians and pa-tients. Finally, advanced technologies such as social media,multi-media, and mobile and wearable devices also call for thedevelopment of ML/AI tools to assist the assessment, diagnosis,or treatment of individuals who are mentally ill or at risk. Themeanings of ML and AI are relatively broad in our current reviewand generally cover a wide range of analytic or predictive toolsthat are designed for finding structures or regularity of data;therefore, ML under our discussion also includes data miningand knowledge discovery. From now on, we will use ML and AIinterchangeably throughout the paper.BACKGROUND OF NEUROIMAGINGAdvances in neuroimagingNeuroimaging provides a window to probe human brains interms of both structural and functional forms and offers variousresolutions to examine brain activity at macroscopic, meso-scopic, and microscopic scales across spatial and temporal do-mains (Figure 1C).Our understanding of brain and behavior relationships hasexpanded exponentially over the last few decades. While thisfactors,improvement may be attributed to a multitude ofadvancement in neuroimaging has played a prominent role.29Ranging from increased utilization of structural neuroimagingtechniques to the significant scientific advancements broughtabout by the increased availability of functional neuroimaging,these technologies have provided significant benefits toimproved understanding of neural correlates and discovery ofbiomarkers in psychiatric disorders.30 Some of the most com-mon neuroimaging methods31 for probing brain functioninclude the utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),diffusion MRI (dMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), electroencephalog-raphy (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electrocorticog-raphy (ECoG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),and positron emission tomography (PET). To date, EEG andfMRI are two most commonly used imaging modalities for pre-cision psychiatry. Specifically, EEG is low cost and easy to op-erate, making it more appealing for clinical practice orhome use.Neuroimaging analysisThese rich neuroimaging modalities allow us to comprehensivelyprobe brain functions. Numerous research efforts have beendevoted to revealing the neurobiological basis of various psychi-atric disorders using advanced neuroimaging analyses. Underspecifically designed cognitive paradigms, task-related neuroi-maging allows us to examine the relationship between brain ac-tivities (e.g., event-related potential and spectral perturbationand reward or emotional processing-related functional activa-tion32,33) and cognitive dysfunctions. A promising direction forprobing brain function using neuroimaging is to investigate brainconnectivity (or connectome).34 Studying the resting-state brainconnectome provides an elegant way to characterize the com-plex brain architecture and uncover brain dysfunctions inintrinsic brain networks.35 Increasing neuroimaging studies sug-llOPEN ACCESSgest that functional connectivity may fluctuate rather than beingstationary during an entire session of data collection.36 Studiesexamining spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks haverecently received growing attention and may reveal meaningfulbrain states associated with different psychiatric conditions.37Another promising approach to establish robust biomarkers forpsychiatry is to combine multiple neuroimaging modalities in adata-driven manner, which offers opportunities to exploitcross-modality complementary information that a single modal-ity approach may not capture.38Feature engineeringThe input data comprise features that are fed to ML algorithms.All ML methods will benefit from proper feature engineering(including but not limited to imputation, scaling, standardization,normalization, transformation, and one-hot encoding).39 Incor-porating knowledge-driven feature engineering into the analysisof specific neuroimaging modalities has shown significant prom-ise in enhancing the model performance and its physiologicalinterpretability. For instance, spatial filtering (or source localiza-tion) followed by orthogonalizing the resulting time series andcalculating their power envelope correlations can mitigate the ef-fects of volume conduction and source leakage, which may leadto more accurate quantification of functional connectivity in EEGor MEG.40–42To fully understand the brain structural and functional organi-zation, we argue that neuroimaging, when combined with mod-ern ML and other ML-powered technologies, can provide power-ful tools in advancing diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention ofpsychiatric disorders.HOW CAN ML HELP PSYCHIATRY?Psychiatry versus other medicine disciplinesThe nature and etiology of mental illnesses remain unclear andchallenging to study. Traditional studies for the neurobiology ofpsychiatric disorders have followed a categorical classificationframework using a case-control design whereby all patientswith a given diagnosis are compared with healthy individuals.The symptom-based diagnosis covered hundreds of thou-sands of different symptom combinations, which has causedextensive clinical heterogeneity.43,44 It is increasingly recog-nized that existing clinical diagnostic categories could misrep-resent the causes underlying mental disturbance. The conven-tional case-control design often fails to match a clinicallyuseful decision process in the absence of differential diag-nostic specificity, which is due to its limited strengths in delin-eating the significant clinical and neurobiological heterogeneityof psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, previous studieshave broadly explored the group effects of neurobiology toexplain its connection to behavior and disease. However,such group-level analyses cannot fully capture individual-levelbrain abnormality that is crucial for developing personalizedmedicine.In addition, many psychiatric disorders may be considered asfalling along multiple dimensions. Cooccurrence of multiple psy-chiatric disorders might reflect different patterns of symptomsresulting from shared risk factors and perhaps the same under-lying disease processes. The high comorbidity in these disordersPatterns 3, November 11, 2022 3llOPEN ACCESSReviewTable 1.

Conventionalstudies focusing on a single diagnostic domain are thereforeinsufficient in uncovering the neural correlates of comorbidityamong multiple disorders or identifying the dimensions of neuralcircuits and behavioral phenotypes.Clinical need driving ML applications in mental healthDespite the rapid progress in psychiatric studies, several areasappear highly underexplored but may carry substantial poten-tials for achieving major breakthroughs toward precision psy-chiatry. First, the capacity to dissect inter- and intra-individualvariability is crucial for understanding the neural basis of varia-tion in human cognition and behavior.45 Studies focusing on thelevel of individuals may find greater success over conventionalstudy-orientated ap-group-levelproaches for psychiatric neuroimaging may further enhancethe ability to find statistically significant effect sizes that canbe used in individuals.46analyses. TranslationalSecond, identifying subgroups (i.e., subtypes) in psychiatricdisorders may delineate disease heterogeneity.Increasingevidence suggests that data-driven subtyping may drive novelneurobiological phenotypes associated with distinctive behaviorand cognitive functioning.15 These stratified phenotypes mayhelp improve the predictability of clinical outcomes and serveas potential biomarkers for treatment selection.42 However, sub-typing analysis is widely viewed as hypothesis generating andposes significant challenges related to reproducibility and phys-iological interpretability.43,47 Linking subtype identification to aparticular outcome or question using well-designed ML ap-proaches is vital to address these challenges.48Third, another promising area focuses on transdiagnostic ap-proaches to uncover neural correlates of specific domains (suchas cognition, arousal, and emotion regulation), which have beenimplicated in psychopathology across the diagnostic spectrum.49Recent ML efforts have been dedicated to identifying transdiag-nostic brain dysfunctions and dimensions of psychopathologyto improve understanding of comorbidity among psychiatric dis-orders.50–53 Importantly, leveraging ‘‘big data’’ from a longitudinalperspective offers a promising way to track the neurobiological4 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022and phenotypic trajectories that have been rarely examined inprevious cross-sectional psychiatric studies.54–56 Ultimately,such longitudinal studies may help reveal the neural mechanismunderlying the disease progression and provide new insights forthe development of timely interventions.It should be noted that the presence of confounding effects isone of the most critical challenges in psychiatry studies.57,58 Forexample, the site effects or unmatched phenotypic information(e.g., demographics and clinical measures) may distort theapparent relationship between input features and output. Medi-cations were also found to strongly alter brain activity and con-nectivity.59,60 Therefore, inappropriately modeling those con-founders can lead to erroneous findings. To date, mentalhealth studies have been done to control the impact of con-founders on biomarker quantification.61,62These new frontiers in studying psychiatric disorders can besubstantially empowered by ML methodologies summarized inTable 1. The applications include stratifying patients into clini-cally meaningful subtypes, discovering novel transdiagnosticdisease dimensions, and tailoring treatment decisions to individ-ual patients. Together, these research outcomes can deliver asignificant promise in promoting the development of objectivebiomarker-based precision psychiatry.The applications of ML in psychiatry can be mainly catego-rized according to their clinical purposes: diagnosis, prognosis,treatment, and readmission. In contrast to most medical disci-plines, traditional diagnoses in psychiatry remain restricted tosubjective symptoms and observable signs and therefore callfor a paradigm shift. ML offers a new paradigm to achieve auto-mated and more objective assessments for various psychiatricconditions. For disease diagnosis, supervised classificationcan be used to identify discriminative biomarkers that distinguisha specific disorder from healthy condition or other mental ill-nesses.63 Unsupervised clustering is useful in identifying diseasesubtypes for dissect clinical and biological heterogeneity, thusoffering new ways of defining psychiatric conditions.42,64 For dis-ease prognosis, classification models can be built to distinguishdifferent course trajectories (e.g., progressor versus non-pro-gressor), whereas regression models are useful for predictingsymptom development during the course of the disease.65 ForReviewllOPEN ACCESSFigure 2.

A tabular review of representativeapplications is shown in Table 2. Specif-ically, we focus on the review of neuroi-maging-based psychiatric studies, anddetailed reviews of the other data domains(such as genetic, clinical, behavioral, andsocial media data) will be presented in latersections. For the sake of space limitation,we will not include exhaustive reviews oflearning, activeall ML paradigms (such as reinforcementlearning, and transfer learning) in this section but rather providesome reference pointers whenever necessary.Supervised and unsupervised learningML holds substantial promise in promoting research from smallcase-control studies to those with large transdiagnostic samplesand from prior specified brain regions to whole-brain circuitdysfunction for individual-level precision medicine.29,105,106 In anew era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to individual pa-tients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow forearly disease detection, personalized treatment selection, anddosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease.18,107,108These promising applications in psychiatric disorders havebeen enabled by leveraging the powerful strength of modernML techniques.21,63,109,110Patterns 3, November 11, 2022 5treatment studies, individual responses to the treatment canbe predicted using classification methods that distinguishresponder from non-responder. Regression-based approachescan also be utilized to predict changes in post-treatment symp-toms.66 For readmission evaluation, supervised classificationcan be used to predict whether an individual would be rehospi-talized or to detect the relapse trajectory.67,68 With a properly de-signed strategy, feature reduction/mapping approaches andknowledge-driven feature engineering can be integrated intothe ML model training to identify more informative and interpret-able biomarker patterns.46It should be noted that ML is an ever-growing big disciplineand covers many categories and emergent topics, each with adifferent technical focus.

Given the high-dimen-sional nature of neuroimaging data,these approaches arecommonly accompanied by a feature selection step to obtainlow-dimensional representations. Connectome-based predic-tive modeling112,113 is one of such approaches that combine sim-ple linear regression and feature selection to predict individualdifferences in traits and behavior from connectivity data. Leastabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) provides analternative approach that performs simultaneous feature selec-tion and prediction to learn a compact feature pattern for accu-rate prediction of a specific disorder or clinical outcome.102 Rele-vance vector machine (RVM) builds upon a probabilisticframework by leveraging automatic relevance determination tolearn a sparse solution and penalize unnecessary modelcomplexity.114,115 RVM has recently demonstrated its strengthin quantifying neuroimaging biomarkers for post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) diagnosis76 as well as for treatment outcomeprediction in depression.100 As an extension of the conventionalsingle-task methods, multi-task learning (MTL) approacheshave been increasingly employed to exploit complementary fea-tures jointly from multiple views of neuroimaging data.116–118Due to the complex nature of the brain’s function, informativefeatures may not be observable in the raw high-dimensionalfeature space. To address this challenge, latent space-basedsupervised learning has been developed to uncover latent di-mensions of neural circuits in psychiatric disorders. For example,a sparse latent space regression algorithm tailored for EEG datawas developed to identify anti-depressant-responsive brain sig-natures in depression.99 By jointly estimating the spatial filtersand regression weights under a convex optimization framework,the ML model was able to successfully reveal treatment-predic-tive signatures in a low-dimensional latent space (see case study1 below). To address comorbidities among psychiatric disor-ders, dimensional approaches have been developed using sta-tistical models capable of discovering the complex linear rela-tionship between high-dimensional datasets. Forinstance,low-dimensional representations of depression-related connec-tivity features have been successfully identified by applyingcanonical correlation analysis (CCA) to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity and clinical symptoms.15 The discovered rep-resentations defined two disease dimensions corresponding toan anhedonia-related component and an anxiety-relatedcomponent, respectively. A similar dimensional analysis wasalso utilized to examine the neural correlates of neuropsychiatricsymptoms in dementia. Using CCA, two latent modes were iden-tified with distinct neuroanatomical bases of common andthe symptoms.119 A sparse CCAmood-specific factors ofapproach has been applied to reveal linked dimensions of psy-chopathology and functional connectivity in brain networks forpsychiatric disorders.51 This approach successfully identifiedinterpretable dimensions, involving mood, psychosis, fear, andexternalizing behavior, all of which guided neural circuit patternsacross the clinical diagnostic spectrum. The partial least squares(PLS) approach was also applied to identify latent componentslinking a broad set of behavioral measures to functional connec-tivity.52 The latent components defined distinct dimensions withdissociable brain functional signatures and provided potential in-termediate phenotypes spanning diagnostic categories. Thesedimensional analytics hold great promise in uncovering noveltransdiagnostic phenotypes for developing targeted inter-ventions.Ensemble learningAlthough ML approaches have been extensively designed for su-pervised learning, using a single model may not produce theoptimal generalization performance for a complex predictiontask. By combining multiple ML models to reduce variance,ensemble learning outperforms a single model in prediction andhas proven successful in discovering robust biomarkers for psy-chiatric disorders. For instance, multi-atlas ensemble-learning al-gorithms have been proposed for improved schizophrenia detec-tion120 and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis.74 ByPatterns 3, November 11, 2022 7llOPEN ACCESSutilizing multi-modal neuroimaging including sMRI, fMRI, andDTI, a bagging-based SVM produced significant improvementin prediction of adult outcomes in childhood-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).72 Based on the selectiveensemble algorithm, a sparse multi-view prediction model hasbeen designed with rs-fMRI connectivity for ASD diagnosis;121this model combined multiple classifiers under a bootstrapframework and significantly outperformed other single-modelapproaches.the cost ofAlthough sophisticated models of supervised learning oftenproduce better classification or prediction performance, theirincreasing modelinterpretability decreases atcomplexity. We will discuss the interpretable ML methods inmore detail later (XAI in psychiatry). Additionally, labeled datarequire ground-truth knowledge, which is not always accurateor reliable in the case of mental disorders. For instance, a skincancer diagnosis may rely on training samples that have beenbiopsied and cataloged, leaving no doubt as to whether theyare malignant or not; however, there is no equivalent of the bi-opsy in mental disorder.Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning relaxes the assumption of labeled sam-ples and can be useful, e.g., for exploratory data analysis, featureengineering, or cluster analysis. Unsupervised learning aims touncover the intrinsic data structure by either identifying potentialclusters (e.g., using latent class analysis or K-means clustering)or learning a feature mapping that satisfies certain criteria (e.g.,using principal-component analysis [PCA]). Identifying patientsubtypes offers a promising strategy to delineate neurobiologicalheterogeneity in psychiatric disorders.43 With rs-fMRI, hierarchi-cal clustering was applied to successfully identify four subtypesof functional connectivity in depression.15 These subtypes werefound to correlate with differing clinical-symptom profiles andpredict responsiveness to brain stimulation therapy. From rs-EEG, two transdiagnostic subtypes were identified using sparseK-means clustering with distinct power envelope connectivitypatterns and found to respond differentially to anti-depressantmedication and psychotherapy.42 As a non-distance probabil-ity-based clustering approach, latent class analysis has alsobeen applied to discover subgroups in psychiatric disorders. Aproof-of-concept study was conducted using latent class anal-ysis to identify ADHD subtypes from fMRI activation profiles83and revealed that the subtype with attenuated brain activityshowed fewer behavior problems in daily life. By leveragingdata resources from multiple time points, psychiatric studieshave been shifting from cross-sectional analysis to longitudinalmodeling.29 Finite mixture modeling became increasingly popu-lar for the analysis of longitudinally repeated-measure data,which can identify latent classes following similar paths of tem-poral development.122,123 Typical finite mixture models includegrowth mixture modeling, group-based trajectory modeling,and latent transition analysis. The use of latent growth mixturemodeling (LGMM) and group-based trajectory modeling hasbecome increasingly popular in studying psychiatric disorders,such as depression, anxiety, and ASD. They offer flexible waysto identify latent subpopulations that manifest heterogeneoussymptom trajectories.124–126 LGMM approaches have alsobeen successfully used to predict the PTSD course among thepopulation at risk.127 As an extension of latent class analysis8 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022Review(LCA) to longitudinal data, latent transition analysis (LTA) maypredict the longitudinal service use for individuals with sub-stance use disorder (SUD).128 Together, these approaches pro-vide powerful tools to delineate longitudinal heterogeneity andthe corresponding distinctive phenotypes during the course ofpsychiatric disorders.Semi-supervised learningSemi-supervised learning is an ML approach that combines su-pervised learning and unsupervised learning. Popular semi-super-vised-learning techniques include self-training, mixture models,cotraining and multi-view learning, graph-based methods, andsemi-supervised clustering.129 These methods have beenincreasingly applied to psychiatric studies. By unifying autoen-coder and classification, a semi-supervised model was developedfor ASD diagnosis.130 A semi-supervised classification has beendevised using graph convolutional networks and applied to thepopulation graph-based diagnosis of ASD.81 A semi-supervisedclustering has also been designed by extending SVM with implicitclustering driven by a convex polytope to form a method calledheterogeneity through discriminative analysis, which can achievejoint disease subtyping and diagnosis.131 This approach hasshown strength in delineating neurostructural heterogeneity in bi-polar and major depressive disorders (MDDs)132 and schizo-phrenia,133 as well as in youth with internalizing symptoms.134Additionally, semi-supervised learning has gained increasingmental health applications in digital data from electronic health re-cords (EHRs), social media, and mobile phones.16,135,136 See ML-powered technologies for psychiatry for a detailed discussion.Normative modelingNormative modeling is an emerging and innovative framework formapping individual differences at the level of a single subject withrespect to a reference model.137 It has been increasingly used inmental health138 to parse the substantial neurobiological hetero-geneity by quantifying individual deviations. By building a norma-tive model of neuroimaging data on a large-scale healthy popula-tion, brain abnormalities of individual patients can be quantifiedby examining their statistical differences from the distribution ofthe norm. Gaussian process (GP) regression-based normativemodeling has been applied to quantify individual deviations anddissect neurobiological heterogeneity in various psychiatric disor-ders. With this tool, an association was successfully discoveredbetween transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology andan individual’s unique deviations from normative neurodevelop-ment in brain structure.84 By combining tolerance interval-basednormative modeling and clustering analysis, individual abnormal-ities in rs-fMRI were accurately quantified to define two stablesubtypes in patients with PTSD.82 The two subtypes showeddistinct patterns of functional connectivity with respect to thehealthy population and differed clinically on levels of reexperienc-ing symptoms. These novel data-driven approaches provide use-fultechniques to identify ‘‘abnormal’’ subtypes in patients,thereby advancing clinical and mechanistic investigations in psy-chiatric disorders. More recently, an autoencoder model has beenutilized to realize normative modeling for detecting microstruc-tural deviations in Chamberland et al.139Deep learningDeep learning consists of a collection of methods that use multi-layered-architecture (R2 hidden layers) artificial neural networksReviewfor ML tasks. Through a specifically designed deep neuralnetwork structure, high-level feature representations can belearned from raw features. Deep learning thus holds promise inoffering an end-to-end analytic framework for disease diagnosisand prediction. With the advancement in neuroimaging technol-ogies, an increasing number of large-scale multi-center datasetshave been established for building powerful ML models to fullyexplore the informative feature representations from complexbrain and genomic data. By training on these large-scale data-sets, deep learning can learn robust neuroimaging representa-tions and outperform standard ML methods in a variety of appli-cation scenarios in mental health.17,140–142Deep autoencoderThe deep autoencoder, also known as stacked autoencoder(SAE), aims to learn latent representations of input data throughan encoder and uses these representations to reconstructoutput data through a decoder. By stacking multiple layers of au-toencoders, a deep autoencoder is formed to discover morecomplicated and potentially non-linear feature patterns. Deepautoencoder has been applied to extract low-dimensional fea-low-frequency fluctuations intures from the amplitude offMRI.143 Clustering analysis with the latent features uncoveredby deep autoencoder further identified two subtypes within ma-jor psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disor-der, and MDD. A deep-learning model was also designed basedon a sparse SAE and applied to lower the dimensionality of fMRIconnectivity. The sparsity constraint used in this model yieldedinterpretable neural patterns for improved ASD diagnosis.144Deep autoencoder has also been applied to implement norma-tive modeling with structural MRI for the quantification of individ-ual abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders,includingschizophrenia and ASD.145 The abnormal features extracted us-ing the normative model led to improved diagnosis performancecompared with the traditional case-control analysis. Recently, adeep contrast variational autoencoder was used to extractneuroanatomicalfeatures from MRI data to identify braindysfunction that can be attributed to ASD and not to othercauses of individual variation.146Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)Different from conventional multi-layer perceptron or autoen-coder assigning a different weight to each input feature, CNNswere designed to better capture the spatial and local structure in-formation from pixels or voxels.110,147 Due to its strength in utiliz-ing neighborhood information to learn hierarchies of features,148CNNs have been one of the most successful deep-learningmodels applied in various medical applications. A diagnosismodel was established through EEG-based image constructioncoupled with the CNN for accurate detection of MDD.79 Thismodel provided an end-to-end framework to successfully identifytranslational biomarkers from rs-EEG in distinguishing depres-sive patients from healthy people. With whole-brain structureMRI, a three-dimensional (3D) CNN model has also been de-signed to automatically extract multi-layer high-dimensional fea-tures for the diagnosis of conduct disorder.149Graph neural networks (GNNs)Though deep-learning models have shown strengths incapturing complex neuroimaging patterns, they may not gener-alize well to non-Euclidean data types (e.g., brain networks). Incontrast, GNNs provide a clever way of learning the deep graphllOPEN ACCESSstructure of non-Euclidean data, leading to enhanced perfor-mance in various network neuroscience tasks.150 For instance,a framework based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs)has been designed for the diagnosis of ASD.81 By building a pop-ulation graph that integrates rs-fMRI data as node features andphenotypic measures as edges, the designed model outper-formed other state-of-the-art methods. An inductive GNN modelwas also devised to embed the graphs containing different prop-erties of task fMRI and drive interpretable connectome bio-markers for ASD detection.73 More recently, a novel GNN modelwas developed to incorporate dynamic graph computation andfeature aggregation of 2-hop neighbor nodes into graph convo-lution for brain network modeling.71 This dynamic GNN signifi-cantly improved the performance in ADHD diagnosis and re-vealed the circuit-level association between connectomicabnormalities and symptom severity.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)As a specific extension of the feedforward neural network, RNNshave the ability to learn features and long-term dependenciesfrom sequential and time-series data. Long-short-term memory(LSTM) models are the most popular RNN and have shown ad-vantages in capturing temporal dynamic information of neuroi-maging data for various psychiatric disorder studies.151 AnLSTM-based RNN architecture was built with the time courseof fMRI-independent components to exploit the temporal infor-mation, which yielded an improved diagnosis of schizophrenia.77By combining RNNs with other deep neural networks, novel MLmodels have also been proposed to model the spatiotemporaldynamics in neuroimaging data. A spatiotemporal CNN modelwas proposed for 4D modeling of fMRI, with confirmed robust-ness in identifying key features in the default mode network.152LSTMs have also been applied to incorporate multi-stage neuro-imaging data into longitudinal analytic frameworks for modelingthe trajectories of psychopathology development in various psy-chiatric disorders. A recent LSTM-based model was built withMEG data to achieve accurate longitudinal tracking of patholog-ical brain states and prediction of clinical outcomes in PTSD.92Generative adversarial networks (GANs)As one type of generative model, GANs have gained consider-able attention in computer vision and natural language process-ing and also have become increasingly popular in neuroimaginganalysis.110 GANs consist of two competing neural networks(one as generator and the other as discriminator) and can learndeep feature representations without extensive labeled data.Due to this unique advantage, GANs have been increasinglyapplied in data augmentation to enhance the sample size formodel training.153 Moreover, GANs have been used to imputemissing values in multi-modal datasets, a common problem inpsychiatric studies, rather than discarding an entire multi-variatedata point.154 The adversarial model has also been incorporatedinto other ML models for specific applications in psychiatricstudies. For instance, the discriminative and generative compo-nents were incorporated in LSTM to form a MTL approach forfMRI-based classification, which resulted in an improved diag-nosis of ASD compared with the standard LSTM.155 By inte-grating GANs with group independent component analysis(ICA), a functional connectivity-based deep-learning modelwas developed for the diagnosis of MDD and schizophrenia.156Specifically, the generator with fake connectivity was trained toPatterns 3, November 11, 2022 9llOPEN ACCESSmatch the discriminator with real connectivity in the intermediatelayers, whereas a new objective loss was determined for thegenerator to improve the diagnosis accuracy. More recently, aconfounder-free deep-learning framework was designed byincorporating the concept of GAN into the model training.62This end-to-end approach is capable of simultaneously learninginformative features and controlling for confounder effects toimprove model performance.The strength of deep-learning algorithms is that they can learncomplex predictor-response mappings, but the power alsocomes at the cost of requiring a very large sample size for modeloptimization. This poses potential overfitting and interpretabilitychallenges in psychiatric applications.17Key ML concepts for precision psychiatryRegardless of the ML paradigms in psychiatric applications,there are some common themes that distinguish human intelli-gence from automated or human-in-the-loop machine intelli-gence. In a recently published white paper, ‘‘Machine intelli-gence for healthcare,’’ four important features are emphasizedfor ML systems.157 These concepts are broadly applicable toprecision psychiatry.19d Trustworthiness: the ability to access the validity and reli-ability of an ML-derived output across varying inputs and en-vironments. In other words, psychiatrists need to be able toevaluate the limitations of an ML system and confidentlyapply system-derived information for psychiatric evaluation.d Explainability: the ability to understand and evaluate the in-ternal mechanism of a machine. The development of MLsystems will need to account for data quality, quality met-rics for the system’s functioning and impact, standards forapplications in the environment, and future updates to thesystem.d Usability: the extent to which an ML system can be used toachieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, andpatient satisfaction in multiple environments. These appli-cations need to be scalable across multiple settings whilepreventing additional burdens on providers and patients.d Transparency and fairness: the right to know and under-stand the aspects of an input that could influence outputs(clinical decision support) from the system. Such factorsshould be available to the people who use, regulate, andare affected by any type of care decision that employsthe ML system. The potential bias in the data or the systemneeds to be identified and informed prior to decision-making.The first two features are related to interpretability, which wewill discuss in more detail in XAI in psychiatry. The other two fea-tures will be discussed in discussion and conclusion.Case studiesTo help the reader get a concrete idea of the reviewed ML tech-niques in psychiatric applications, here we present several casestudies to illustrate the strengths in prediction/classificationdiagnosis analytics. These representative case studies employdifferent ML strategies and cover different data modalities,including rs-EEG, task fMRI, and ECoG.10 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022ReviewCase study 1: Sparse latent space learning for EEG-based treatment prediction in depressionAnti-depressants have shown only modest superiority over pla-cebo, which is partly because the clinical diagnosis of MDD en-compasses biologically heterogeneous conditions that relatedifferentially to treatment outcomes. It is important to develop arobust neurobiological signature for an anti-depressant-respon-sive phenotype that determines which patients will benefit frommedications. To address the challenge, Wu et al.99 developed asparse EEG latent space regression (SELSER) model to predictthe treatment outcome. Specifically, SELSER optimizes thespatial filters and regression weights in conjunction under aconvex optimization framework and identifies an anti-depres-sant-responsive EEG signature for MDD (Figure 3A). The identi-fied signature accurately predicts anti-depressant outcomes(n = 228). A neurophysiologically interpretable cortical patternwas further observed through a source mapping from the scalpspatial pattern, mainly contributed by the right parietal-occipitalregions and the lateral prefrontal regions (Figure 3B). The valida-tion on an independent cohort showed that the treatment out-comes predicted by the brain signature are significantly higherin a partial responder group versus a treatment-resistant group,demonstrating its further clinical utility in the broader constructof treatment resistance in depression.Case study 2: Unsupervised learning-basedidentification of neurophysiological subtypes inpsychiatric disordersNeurobiological heterogeneity has a substantial impact on treat-ment outcome independent of pre-treatment clinical symptoms.For example, although psychotherapy is currently the mosteffective treatment for PTSD, many patients are nonethelessnon-responsive and display differences in brain function relativeto responsive patients. Using sparse K-means clustering, Zhanget al.42 developed a data-driven framework to achieve simulta-neous feature selection and subtyping on the high-dimensionalpower envelope connectivity of rs-EEG source-reconstructedsignals. This approach successfully identified two transdiagnos-tic subtypes with distinct functional connectivity patterns inPTSD and MDD (n = 648), which were prominently within thefrontoparietal control network and default mode network(Figure 3C). Importantly, linear mixed models in an intent-to-treatanalysis on symptom severity revealed that the two subtypesdifferentially responded to psychotherapy and anti-depressantversus placebo. An RVM-based classification analysis furtherconfirmed thatthe EEG connectivity-driven subtypes weredistinguishable using rs-fMRI connectivity. The discriminativepattern identified from fMRI was also consistent with the EEGconnectivity pattern (Figure 3D).Case study 3: Classification of anxious versus non-anxious brains from fear extinction learning task-based fMRIUsing a neuroimaging cohort study (n = 304 adults, 92 patientswith anxiety, 74 trauma-exposed individuals, 138 matched con-trols), Wen et al.158 examined how the fMRI activations of 10brain regions that were commonly activated during fear condi-tioning and extinction (Figure 4A) might distinguish anxious ortrauma-exposed brains from controls. They proposed a CNNclassifier (Figure 4B) to map fear-induced fMRI activities in spaceand time to a prediction probability score indicating that thellOPEN ACCESSReviewABCDFigure 3.

The CNN achieved an areaunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 ±0.01, 0.75 ± 0.03 sensitivity, and 0.77 ± 0.02 specificity in 5-foldcross-validation (Figure 4C), outperforming other ML methods(e.g., SVM and random forest). The prediction score was alsofound to correlate with the anxiety sensitivity index (ASI) in thecontrol group (Figure 4D). Furthermore, control analyses wereperformed to demonstrate the specificity of the fear network indiscrimination (Figure 4E).Case study 4: Decoding mood state from multi-siteintracranial brain activityFrom intracranial ECoG signals and simultaneously collectedself-reported mood-state measurements over multiple days inseven patients with epilepsy, Sani et al.159 developed a dynamicstate-space modelframework to track the patients’mood-state variations over time (Figure 5A). The modelingframework consists of unsupervised- and supervised-learningcomponents (Figure 5B). The spectro-spatial features were ex-tracted from the mood-predictive network within the limbic brainregion. The neural decoders were also highly predictive of the(SSM)immediate mood scaler (IMS) points at the population level.Furthermore, the same trained decoder could be used formood-state prediction across hours and days and generalizedacross a wide range of IMS. In cross-validation, the decoderscould predict IMS variations that covered 73% and 33% ±7.2% of the total possible IMS range across all seven subjectsand within individuals, respectively (Figure 5C). These resultssuggest that ML-based decoders can predict mood-state varia-tions from brain activity across multiple days of recordings in pa-tients.ML-POWERED TECHNOLOGIES FOR PSYCHIATRYML can be applied to a wide range of digital platforms, includingsoftware (e.g., mobile apps), hardware (e.g., wearable devices,robots), social services (e.g., online chatbots), and clinical prac-tice (e.g., EHRs). In this section, we will review various ML-pow-ered technologies in the non-neuroimaging domains and high-light the emerging digital platforms for precision psychiatry.Patterns 3, November 11, 2022 11llOPEN ACCESSACBReviewDEFigure 4.

The definition of telether-apy today has expanded to include these newer modalities ofcare delivery. These advances in care delivery have enabled col-lecting massive amounts of text, audio, and video data on a reg-ular basis, which was previously only available in controlledresearch settings. Furthermore, the recent advancements of nat-ural language processing, speech, and video analysis technolo-gies, combined with the ML tools, have generated numerous in-novations in this emerging field. The global psychiatristcommunity is increasingly aware of these developments. Forexample, a recent survey among more than 700 psychiatristsshowed that 49% believed that in the next 5–10 years, ML tech-nology will help analyze patient information to establish prog-nosis, and 54% believed that this technology can help synthe-size patient information to reach a diagnosis.12ML can be applied across all stages of a patient’s journey:161,162risk assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and relapse in avariety of disorders,163 where the analysis can be applied to naturallanguage, speech, facial expressions, body language, and socialmedia, as well as traditional clinical surveys and neuroimagingdata.22,164 Table 3 summarizes recent representative studies thatuse ML to support various stages of patient journey. ApplyingML can build personalized models that are optimized for each pa-tient,8 as opposed to traditional models that are only optimized forgroup effects. Furthermore, given the inter- and intra-disorder vari-12 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022ability between clinical diagnosis and symptoms, ML methodssuch as MTL can be used to model differential diagnoses betweendisease categories. All of these mentioned ML applications can beconsidered to be the first level of precision psychiatry.However, the amount of precision that can be modeled usingML is far beyond the first level.181,182 During psychiatric evalua-tion, psychiatrists may try to build a mental model of what isgoing on in the patient’s life in about 30 min. They aim to under-stand as much as possible about the patient’s history within ashort time, define what ‘‘normal’’ looks like for the patient, andidentify deviations from the normal. This is often done by askingquestions to the patient and examining their speech, body lan-guage, and behavioral responses. It is very challenging andnearly unrealistic to expect psychiatrists to build an accuratebaseline model of the patient’s entire life within such a shorttime span while interacting with the patient in a compromisedpsychological state. ML can help by building baseline modelsspecific to each patient before their visit and present the boundsfor various observations as a reference to psychiatrists duringthe exam.183 This can be viewed as the second level of precisionpsychiatry (Figure 6A). Take MDD as an example: Figure 6Bshows how ML can be applied at different stages of a patient’sjourney.In the following subsections, we describe how ML can beapplied to clinically relevant data and to support one or morestages of the patient’s journey.Mobile and sensing technologiesThe development of smartphones, smart watches, and otherwearable sensing devices have enabled us to access moreReviewFigure 5. Illustrations of concepts and major findings in case study 4(A) Schematic of cross-validation. An IMS point (e.g., SN) is left out as the testIMS to be predicted. The other IMS points (i.e., training IMS, using S1 to SN–1)and the associated neural activity are used within the modeling framework totrain a neural encoding model.(B) Main components of the modeling framework based on both unsupervisedand supervised learning.(C) Cross-validated prediction of the mood state is shown against the truemeasured mood state (copyright Springer Nature; figures were modified fromSani et al.159 with permission).information about our physical and mental health than ever.184Specifically, several types of signals are relevant for mentalhealth monitoring and assessment (Figure 7A):d Behavioral and physical signals: location (e.g., GPS coor-dinates), mobility (e.g., accelerometer).d Multi-media signals: face expression, speech patterns.d Social signals: social interactions (e.g., call and text mes-sage logs), communication patterns, engagement, onlinegaming.d Physiological signals: skin conductance, heart rate vari-ability (HRV), eye movement, electrodermal activity (EDA).d Sleep activity: sleep duration, sleep staging, phone on/offstatus.These signals have different implications and relevance tomental illnesses. Although a single signal may not be indicativellOPEN ACCESSof a mental disorder, combination of these physical/physiolog-ical/social cues may reveal important clues of individual mentalhealth. In what follows, we will focus on the analysis of multi-me-dia, language, and social media data for development of theirmental health applications.Speech and video analysesTo date, voice and visual (video of facial expressions and bodylanguage behaviors) data have gained increasing attention inthe studies of mental disorders. ML technologies using speechsamples obtained from the clinic or accessed remotely mayhelp identify biomarkers to improve diagnosis and treatment.Since the early days of practice, psychologists have alreadyused auditory and visual cues to assist with the diagnosis ofillnesses.185 Furthermore, speech and video are notmentalonly readily available in traditional teletherapy settings but arealso easily interpretable as the most natural form of humancommunication.Audio and speech featuresAcoustic features derived from audio data have been found to berelevant in many mental disorders,175,186 including speech anal-ysis for patients with depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia.Table 4 lists some commonly used acoustic features in the anal-ysis of mental illnesses.187 These categories have enabled stan-dardization and interpretation of ML-analyzed speech data inclinical applications.Models built from speech-based features may be effective inpredicting the diagnosis of depression and suicidality.188 Appli-cations for depression include predicting the presence, severity,and score.165,173 These models use prosodic, spectral, or otherfeatures computed from raw speech data to quantify flatteredspeech, slow speech, and other relevant markers. The targetoutcome variable is derived from a clinically valid scale suchas a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Furthermore, modelsfor suicidality that explore similar features have been used inmulti-class settings to differentiate among healthy, depressed,and suicidal speech.One key challenge in applying speech-based models in clin-ical practice is the lack of longitudinal data validation in real-world settings. However, this issue is starting to get addressedin recent studies,197 which detect manic and depressive speechfrom recordings of outgoing calls from phone conversations ofconsenting participants. Another challenge is the lack of largelabeled datasets for evaluating performance across variousmethods. To this end, it is noted that companies like EllipsisHealth166,198 have used deep learning and transfer learning topredict depression and anxiety scores with high accuracy basedon a large labeled dataset of over 10,000 unique speakers. Hu-man-level accuracy using only 20–30 s of an audio clip hasbeen reported in some commercial applications to detectdepression.199,200Visual featuresAlthough body language and facial expressions have alwaysformed a key part of a psychiatric exam, ML has only recentlybeen applied to analyze such data objectively. To date, mostwork has focused on suicidal ideation,189 depression,168,169,190schizophrenia,178 and ASDs.192 Features derived from overallfacial expression, eyes, gait, and posture (Table 4) have beenshown to be relevant across many mental disorders.Patterns 3, November 11, 2022 13llOPEN ACCESSReviewTable 3.

This makes the MLmodels more applicable in augmenting human caregivers bybringing up a specific insight that they would like to measure.In depression studies, some approaches have also involvedfusion of video features derived from each frame that are usedto train a sequential DNN,201 and some have used pre-trainingto compensate a relatively small sample size of depression data-sets.202 While these models perform very well on the same held-out test set, their clinical applications remain limited due to a lackof interpretability. To improve interpretability, depression activa-tion maps were developed to highlight the facial areas corre-sponding to the depression severity as learned by the MLmodel.203 Meanwhile, utilization of pre-defined features hasbeen most effective in providing interpretable results.202,204Natural language processing (NLP)NLP techniques enable computers to analyze, understand, andderive meaning from text and speech in a similar manner to hu-mans. NLP techniques can enable mental health professionals toevaluate language patterns to help identify and predict psychiat-ric illness (Table 4). Language is not only one of the primary ex-pressions of human behavior that carries a variety of implicitand explicit markers relevant to mental health205,206 but is alsomore abundantly available compared with speech data. Forexample, social media platforms contain a large quantity ofreal-world language data, whereas speech data are rarely avail-able at that scale. There are two types of NLP applications for de-tecting specific mental health symptoms. The first type of appli-cations is directly applied to the patient data, varying frompredicting the risk of suicide and early psychiatric readmissionto identifying phenotypes and comorbidities. The second typeof applications is applied to EHRs and clinical records (tests,transcripts), which can be used for automating chart reviews,clustering patients into phenotype subtypes, and predicting pa-tient-specific outcomes. The EHRs (including pathology reports,lab results, clinical tests, and clinical session transcripts) are sys-tematic collections of longitudinal, patient-centered clinical re-cords. Patients’ EHRs consist of both structured and unstruc-tured data. The structured data include information about apatient’s diagnosis, medications, and laboratory test results,and the unstructured data include information in the form of clin-ical notes.Massive EHR datasets have provided opportunities to adaptML approaches to track and identify target areas for qualityimprovement in mental health care. According to a 2015 nationalsurvey, 61.3% of US psychiatrists use EHRs.207 The EHR lan-guage is at least one level abstracted from the patient’s symp-toms, consisting of clinical notes. However, the unique advan-tage of EHR data is the ease with which demographic and14 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022ReviewABllOPEN ACCESSFigure 6. ML for precision psychiatry(A) Two levels of precision in applying ML for mental health.(B) Examples of ML applications at various stages of a patient’s journey in case of MDD.socioeconomic features can be combined with the languagedata. Symptoms derived from free texts in EHRs have beenused for prediction of bipolar disorder,193 situational aggres-sion,208 and suicidal ideation,209 with achieved comparable per-formance to clinicians. Furthermore, discharge summaries fromEHRs have also been used to predict relapse.210 Aside fromsymptoms, a variety of relevant mental health data (such asthe intervention status and physical health comorbidities) canbe routinely extracted from EHRs using NLP methods.211 Pri-vacy concerns around EHR data sharing remain one of the keychallenges in validating generalization of NLP methods. Encour-agingly, there has been a growing interest in using transformersfor generating artificial mental health clinical notes to mitigatethis issue.211,212The advances in text-based mental health interventions (e.g.,Talkspace and CrisisTextLine) have made transcripts of clinicalsessions easily amenable to NLP. Aside from developing modelsfor detecting suicidal ideation,213 NLP can also be applied tothese datasets to identify the population-level trend, such asthe increase in anxiety and decrease in quality of personal rela-tionships during the COVID-19 pandemic.214 Since languagedata are ubiquitous, one of the NLP challenges in mental healthapplications is data standardization. Depending on the task,different types of data may yield different levels of ‘‘signal.’’ Forexample, to predict first-episode psychosis,language datafrom clinical tests have higher performance compared with tran-scripts of free speech.194 On the other hand, data collected fromfree-speech samples for diagnostic purposes can be highlyeffective for developing a language-based depression screeningthat generalizes well across various age groups.170,195,198Social mediaTo date, social media companies have collected a large amountof language data that may contain clinically relevant information.This information can not only be extracted on a population level,such as the notable rise in cognitive distortions over time,215 butcan also be attributed on an individual level,216 all of which havemade social media a powerful tool to support mental health riskassessment and diagnosis. Language from Facebook posts, forexample, has been shown to contain markers for depression.Rumination and sadness can be detected in such data up to6 months prior to a clinical diagnosis.171 Models applied to Face-book and other social platforms (e.g., Twitter and Reddit) havebeen successfulin predicting the diagnosis of psychosis,anorexia, anxiety, and stress levels.196,217,218 In addition to thelanguage analysis for the user posts and comments, ML modelsmay also process media data such as Instagram images219 orintegrate images and text to infer the user’s mental state.219,220Entries of online search also form a complementary and equallycompelling dataset alongside social media activity.Recent developments of transformer models, including thoselanguage representations, have enabledlearning multi-lingualresearchers to apply powerful NLP models to detect depressionor self-harm from social media data.221,222 Furthermore, special-ized language representations that were trained on mentalhealth-specific conversations and that became publicly avail-able223 have been shown to improve performance comparedwith non-specific representations. Finally, an ML techniqueknown as transformers can assess text responses via NLP andpredict traditional subjective well-being measures approachingthe theoretical upper limits in accuracy.224While social media solves the scale issue with millions of sam-ples available, most social media data lack clinically valid la-bels.225 Most reported studies have relied on using labels fromself-disclosure of mental illness, which are not only inaccuratebut also bring additionalissues of defining a healthy control.Despite the challenges, the validity of social media data hasbeen repeatedly proven to support mental health diagnosisand risk assessment.Sensing technologies and mobile mental healthSmartphones, wearables, and other devices equipped withambient sensors (Figure 7B) are increasingly capable ofrecording physiological measurements that are known to affectmental health.226 In addition, some of the less obvious measure-ments (such as keystroke usage patterns) have been shown toPatterns 3, November 11, 2022 15llOPEN ACCESSFigure 7.

This has inspired many corporations to inventtechnologies for detecting depression and cognitive declinebased on data collected from their wearable devices.231Sensor-based measurements are found to be correlated with16 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022Reviewhigh-stress levels and a variety of ailments including depression,anxiety, psychosis, and bipolar disorder.232,233 Since sensor-based data are widespread and readily available, they offer anopportunity to build baseline models for individual users, whichcan be then used to identify significant physiological changesin users and further inform clinical interventions. Devices thatcollect various data streams from patients, such as surveys,cognitive tests, social medialinteractions, GPS coordinates,and behavioral patterns (e.g., keyboard typing), have a great po-tential for monitoring, managing, and predicting the individual’smental health.234,235 Overall, longitudinal quantification of thesedata streams may result in clinically meaningful markers that canbe used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices,improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes (such asearly signs ofrelapse), and develop new interventionmodels.236–239Commercial and research platforms and servicesWhile studies have demonstrated promising results in ML appli-cations for the individual’s journey in mental health, their broadapplicability in clinical practice remains limited. Table 6 lists ex-amples of platforms and services that use ML for mental healthapplications. While most platforms focus on risk assessmentbased on single modality, the initial commercial viability of theseplatforms is still promising for the success of using ML in mentalhealth because they enable a collection of large amounts of datathat can be used to further validate biomarkers.There are between 10,000 and 20,000 smartphone apps thatdigitize mindfulness or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) tech-niques,244 allowing the user to engage in psychotherapy at agreatly reduced price compared with in-person therapy. Howev-er, the quality is highly variable, and the mechanisms used tovalidate them are often dubious. Moreover, since this area isrelatively new, the industry and governmental standards to vali-date such a technology are still in the early phase. We will brieflyoutline two interrelated areas of development: digital measure-ments and digital interventions.Digital measurementsWe are entering a new era of digital psychiatry.11,245 In 2016, theHarvard professor Jukka-Pekka Onnela coined the term ‘‘digitalphenotype,’’246 which refers to the use of mobile devices andother digital data sources to measure behavior and physiologyfor understanding brain activity that is relevant to pathologicalstates. These techniques utilize measurement paradigms fromtranslational neuroscience, which were developed in laboratorysettings such as direct quantification of motor (i.e., movement,muscle activation) and physiological activity (i.e., heart rate, elec-tro-dermal response) more than traditional clinical scales or self-report scales. The advantage of this approach is that it betteraligns with emerging knowledge of rapid-acting biological pro-cesses and provides high measurement accuracy through directrapid sampling, which is in contrast to traditional clinical mea-sures that are taken sporadically over a long period.164,247,248These measurement approaches have relevance in multipleareas including treatment development, treatment selection,and ongoing monitoring.Medications that target mental health conditions have a signif-icant history offailure. Most psychiatric medications werediscovered capriciously rather than being developed based onReviewllOPEN ACCESSTable 4.

As newmedications emerge from basic and translational neuroscienceresearch, both drug developers and clinicians struggle withhow to measure the effects of new treatments and how to prop-erly target old treatments. For example, traditional anti-depres-sant medications are designed to slowly titrate serotonin levels,resulting in slow global effects over a 2- to 4-week period. Corre-spondingly, measures of depression based on the DSM, queryabout the presence of depressive states over a 2-week period.New classes of anti-depressants such as ketamine and psilocy-binpsylocibin affect specific depressive symptoms in minutes.Further, the mechanistic effects, and thus the need for measure-ment, is much more specific and granular. In fact, most classesof anti-depressants including serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) and psilocybinpsylocibin, and ketamine, act on seroto-nin receptors that ultimately impact peripheral motor and phys-iological activity.249,250 Serotonin regulation willlikely have adirect effect on depression symptoms such as psychomotorretardation, but the direct effect on feelings of guilt is minimal.As such, methods used to directly measure motor output havea higher likelihood of capturing both pathology and treatmenteffects.As an example, research effort has been dedicated to usingcomputer vision and voice to directly quantify motor activity.Some recent work has demonstrated that digital phenotypingparameters that reflect gross motor activity including speechcharacteristics (rate of speech, tone) and facial/head move-ments are associated with suicidal risk,189 SSRI response inMDD,251 negative symptomatology in schizophrenia,191 andParkinsonian tremor.252 Such approaches are now beingcommercialized for all phases of drug development from proofof concept to direct measurement in order to make decisionsabout ongoing treatment needs. Such measures solve many ofthe current problems in clinical measurement since they canbe captured remotely in an automated way. These measurescan also be captured at a much higher frequency and providea sensitive numeric value.Meanwhile, these new approaches to measurement have sig-nificant challenges. First, methods that are adapted from the lab-oratory often lack the tight experimental control necessary tointerpret the data correctly. For example, a rapid change in phys-iological responses (such as adrenaline and cortisol, or HRV) canindicate stress but also exercise or other forms of exertion. Sec-ond, while the scientific basis of these measurement paradigmsmay be sound, commercial approaches are rarely validated tothe extent required to be of clinical utility, or they are rarely suf-ficiently transparent in their approach to be used for regulatoryapproval.Digital interventionsThe other rapidly emerging area of mental health technology aredigital approaches to clinical care. We will briefly outline some ofthe leading approaches. Importantly, digital approaches to clin-ical care are often aligned with a digital measurement approachas these approaches are ‘‘blind’’ without some sort of remotedata. A number of companies such as Mindstrong Health,227IesoTrigger Health,253 and Headspace Health254,255 have at-tempted to integrate digital phenotyping to identify when pa-tients are in acute clinical need. However, it is unclear how accu-rate these methods are, as they are typically unpublished. Thishas led to the development of models that can identify patternsin patient’s and clinician’s language that are markers ofimproved outcomes;256 these can be further used to measuresuccess of various therapy modalities and treatment design,as well as to improve care quality.257Digital therapeutics proposes the use of mobile devices tooffer CBT, mindfulness, or other validated psychotherapy in anPatterns 3, November 11, 2022 17llOPEN ACCESSReviewTable 5.

These app-based approaches undergo thesame clinical validation process as traditional medications andare often developed in collaboration with large drug developers.Examples that are in development or have received US Food andDrug Administration (FDA) approval include treatments for SUD,ADHD, schizophrenia, ASD, MDD, PTSD, and generalized anxi-ety disorder (GAD).258While digital therapeutics attempt to scale treatment, tele-health aims to scale the treatment provider network. Mentalhealth treatment is an area where there are many effective treat-ments but little access to treatment providers.259 The issue of ac-cess became most acute during the emergence of COVID-19,when significant wide-spread mental health needs emergedalong with greatly decreased access to care. To address thisneed, a large array of options have emerged, many reinforcedby the emergency COVID-19 Telehealth Act of 2021 that enabledremote patient care.260 These services, which are directly acces-sible to consumers or, more often, provided by a third-partypayer, provide access to professionals based on different mobileplatforms including text, voice, and video communication. Ser-vices vary from mental health coaching provided by certified pro-fessionals to mental health assessment provided by psychia-infancy, earlytrists and psychologists. While stillevidence has shown that telehealth services can perform at par-ity with traditional in-person therapy.261LimitationsAlthough digital measurements have been rapidly adopted inmental health applications, most of current commercial AI ap-plications for mental health have not focused on neuroimagingdata. This is partially because of several reasons. First, thedata acquisition, quality, privacy, and security issues havenot been sufficiently or satisfactorily addressed (see discus-sion and conclusion), creating a gap between commercialand laboratory settings. Second, the scalability of real-timeneuroimaging technology (such as EEG) is not yet quite ready.Third, the lack of an automatic and efficient (e.g., cloud-based) ML-powered neuroimaging data analysis pipelinealso creates a barrier for brain-state monitoring. Future inte-gration of portable EEG recordings and ML-powered plat-forms would expand the horizon of mobile mental health andteletherapy.in theirMULTI-MODAL DATA FUSION IN DIAGNOSTICANALYTICSA central goal of precision psychiatry is to integrate all clinical,physiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral data to derive reli-18 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022WoeBot240Mindstrong227Sonde Health167Ellipsis Health166Amazon Halo241Apple Watch200Alphabet Fitbit242Kintsugi243Bewie234languagekeystrokesvoicevoicevoicedepression, anxietyserious mental illnessmental fitnessstressemotion detectionmobility, sleepdepressionskin conductancestressvoiceraw data fromsmartphonedepression, anxietymultipleMindDoclanguage(ask daily question)depressionClarigent Healthvoicesuicide riskable individualized diagnosis and therapeutics.Importantly,health-related data are produced daily, especially from personaldevices. The most essential effort in multi-modal data analysistasks is to explore the relationship between modalities, comple-mentarity, shared versus modality-specific information, andother mutual properties. Multi-modal data fusion techniques pre-sent a framework to infer information on how different data mo-dalities interact and can be integrated for improved disease pre-diction.38,262,263 In this section, we will review several data fusionmethods in diagnostic analytics (popular ML methods for multi-modal fusion). We will focus on multi-modal neuroimaging data(multi-modal neuroimaging studies), and then extend the discus-sion to other modalities including vocal and visual expressiondata (multi-modal fusion of non-imaging data).Popular ML methods for multi-modal fusionIn the past decades, numerous research efforts have been dedi-cated to developing powerful ML methods for multi-modal datafusion.38,264–267 Some commonly used approaches are summa-rized below (Figure 8).Multi-variate correlation analysisCCA is a standard statistical method based on second-orderstatistics for data fusion. It aims at finding a pair of linear trans-formations to drive latent variables (also known as [aka] canoni-cal variates) that have maximized correlation between twodifferent data modalities.268 For a more general setting, multi-set/multi-way CCA (mCCA) has been developed as an extensionof the standard CCA to multi-modal fusion by maximizing theoverall correlation among latent variables from more than twosets of modalities.38,269 Similar to CCA, PLS and its extensions,i.e., multiway PLS (N-PLS), provide alternative approaches tointegrating multi-modal data by maximizing the covariance be-tween latent variables from different modalities.270,271Matrix and tensor factorizationBased on matrix and tensor factorization techniques, joint blindsource separation (BSS) approaches have been developed andsuccessfully applied to multi-modalfusion of biomedicaldata.265,272 As a typical example, joint ICA (jICA) aims to maxi-mize the independence among jointly estimated componentsfrom multiple modalities that are assumed to share the sameReviewFigure 8. Summary of typical approaches for multi-modal datafusion in psychiatry studiesmixing matrix.273 The jICA approach involves concatenating mo-dality features alongside each other and then performing ICA onthe composite feature matrix.274 Independent vector analysis(IVA) is another extension of ICA to multiple datasets. IVA makesuse of dependence across datasets by defining source compo-nent vectors concatenating a specific source estimated frommultiple modalities.264,265 Coupled matrix and tensor factoriza-tion (CMTF) was also developed to simultaneously factorize mul-tiple datasets in the form of matrices and high-order tensors usingtensor decomposition,275 showing strength in capturing the po-tential multi-linear structure for multi-modal fusion. Besides ex-tracting shared common components, some multi-modal fusiontasks are also interested in deriving individual components thatare modality specific. Common and individual feature analysis(CIFA)276 and joint and individual variation explained (JIVE)277models have been proposed to achieve this goal. By jointly de-composing multiple feature matrices, CIFA and JIVE are able tosimultaneously estimate common and individual feature sub-spaces. A further extension of CIFA has been achieved byleveraging high-order tensor factorization,272 which provides anefficient way to perform a multi-dimensional fusion of multipledata modalities.Multi-kernel learningMulti-kernel learning (MKL) has won many successful applica-tions in multi-modal data fusion due to the full utilization of mul-tiple kernels that enable simultaneous learning from variousmodalities with heterogeneous data.278,279 Different kernelsnaturally correspond to different modalities, such as neuroi-maging, clinical, behavior, speech features, etc., which mayprovide complementary information to drive improved modallearning performance. The MKL problem can be set as alinear combination of kernel matrices or a non-linear functionwith specified forms of regularization. MKL may be designedunder different ML models including SVM, GP, and clustering.Among them, MKL-SVM has been most popularly applied tointegrate heterogeneous data modalities in studies of mentalhealth.280–282Deep learning-based fusionCutting-edge deep-learning techniques have become increas-fusion.283 Data fusioningly popularthrough deep learning allows integration of multiple modalitiesbased on learned high-level feature representations that aretheoretically more comparable with each other and more infor-mative for predicting the targets.284 By exploiting cross-modalmanifolds as a feature graph, a deep manifold-regularizedlearning model was recently designed to integrate transcrip-tomics and electrophysiology data from neuronal cells, andyielded promising performance for phenotype prediction.285for deep multi-modalllOPEN ACCESSGNNs show capability in information fusion for multi-modalcausability by defining casual links between features with graphstructures, thereby enhancing the explainability of the derivedmulti-modal feature representation.286 By extending GNNs tomulti-modal structures, deep-representation approaches havealso been designed for integrating brain networks constructedfrom diverse modalities.287–289Multi-modal neuroimaging studiesNeuroimaging data types are intrinsically dissimilar in nature,having different spatial and temporal resolutions.266 Instead offeeding the entire dataset into a combined analysis, an alternateapproach is to reduce each modality to low-dimensional (latent)features of selected brain activity or structure and then exploreassociations across these feature sets through variations acrossindividuals. Exploiting such latent feature representations frommultiple neuroimaging modalities for diagnosis has generallybeen shown to improve performance compared with using a sin-gle modality alone.290 Multi-modal fusion allows for integration ofneuroimaging data modalities from different scales of spatial andtemporal resolutions. Combining multi-modal neuroimaging of-fers an elegant way to exploit complementary information formore accurate and robust characterization of brain dysfunctionsand hence is instrumentalin optimal decisions for diagnosis,prognosis, and treatment in psychiatry.A combination of mCCA and jICA was successfully applied tofMRI and DTI fusion in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolardisorder.291 CMTF has been applied to identify diagnostic bio-markers of schizophrenia by integrating sMRI,fMRI, andEEG.292 MKL-SVM has been successfully applied to integratemulti-modal structural neuroimaging for predicting differentialdiagnosis between bipolar and unipolar depression293 and tocombine sMRI and fMRI for improved classification of traumasurvivors with and without PTSD.294 More recently,it alsoshowed efficacy in the diagnosis of early adolescent ADHD byintegrating sMRI, fMRI, and DTI.295 In learning low-dimensionalrepresentations of fMRI and sMRI,296 the fMRI can be split intoseveralindependent component networks, each treated as aseparate modality along with the structural scan for learning us-ing autoencoders. Furthermore, MKL methods have been usedfor diagnosing schizophrenia by combining markers from MRIand DTI.297 A multi-modal GCN was designed to integrate func-tional and structural connectomics data for an improved predic-tion of phenotypic characterizations in ASD.287 By combiningmultiple typical neural network structures, multi-modal deep-learning models have also been developed to effectively inte-grate fMRI connectivity and sMRI features298 and also genomicdata299 for discovering schizophrenia-associated brain dysfunc-tion. Methods for learning joint representations from neuroimag-ing and non-neuroimaging data are still in early development,300and there is an opportunity for ML methods to evolve for thistask. For example, transformer networks with late fusion canbe used to learn joint representations from various modalitiessuch as EEG and eye movement signals.301Multi-modal fusion of non-imaging dataMulti-modal approaches consist of combining data from varioussources to jointly arrive at an answer.

In addition, this enablesmodeling the inter-dependencies between these data that maynot be observable by a human expert at the same time. Forexample, many features listed in Table 4 are known to be rele-vant in depression; however, observing them simultaneouslycan be very challenging for a clinician. MKL and MTL methodshave been used to jointly learn from sensor and smartphone us-age data to predict subjective well-being.302 The success oftransformer networks in jointly modeling video, speech, and lan-guage data has catalyzed multi-modal modeling in mentalhealth.303 Multi-modal modeling techniques can also be usedin characterizing symptoms such as emotion dysregulation,304loneliness,305 and sentiment analysis.306 In a prognostic study,an SVM-based multi-modal ML approach was developed tointegrate clinical, neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic in-formation to predict psychosis in patients with clinical high-riskstates.87 Deep autoencoder-based fusion approaches havebeen designed to integrate dynamics of facial and head move-ment and vocalization and successfully applied to the predictionof depression severity.307ML FOR MOLECULAR PHENOTYPING IN PSYCHIATRYMolecular phenotyping is referred to as the technique of quanti-fying pathway reporter genes (i.e., pre-selected genes that aremodulated specifically by metabolic and signaling pathways) inorder to infer activity of these pathways. Mapping genes and ge-nomics to behaviors can identify risk factors and biomarkers inmental disorders. The brain is the central organ exposed tostressors and external behavioral interventions and is thereforevulnerable to changes in multiple interacting biological networks20 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022Reviewat the systems level. ML methods may play an active role incapturing the complexities of interacting variables within andacross multiple levels (Figure 9A). For instance, at the molecularlevel, ML may help identify mechanistic-based phenotypingmodels as new targets for prevention and treatment of moodand cognitive disorders. The advent of unbiased next-generationsequencing (NGS) has prompted the development of bioinfor-matics and ML tools to profile and decode large molecular data-sets (e.g., transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics) at thegenome-wide level in health and disease states (Figure 9B). Todate, increasing applications of ML methods have integratedthese multi-level molecular datasets with clinical characteristicsto map specific neurobiological substrates into the complexity ofsymptom clusters, which may further help the classificationof diseases, prediction of treatment outcomes, and selectionof personalized treatment.Animal models have been playing a vital role in precision psy-chiatry for understanding disease mechanisms and predictingtreatment responses.308,309 Gene expression studies that inte-grate neuroscience, ML, and bioinformatics approaches cancontribute to advancing understanding of the molecular basisof MDD and bridge the knowledge gap between animals and hu-mans. Using RNA sequencing assays and gene coexpressionnetwork analyses (based on hierarchical clustering to identifygene modules), differential gene expression profiles have beenshown across six key brain regions in post-mortem tissues of pa-tients with MDD compared with age- and sex-matched controls,along with remarkable sex differences in these molecular path-ways.310 Recent work using RNA sequencing assays at single-nucleus resolution (snRNA-seq) and t-distributed stochasticneighbor embedding (t-SNE) analyses showed cell-type-specifictranscriptomic profiles in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefron-tal cortex (PFC) that are differentially regulated in MDD cases.311Importantly, these gene expression studies in humans were sup-ported by findings in rodents showing a brain that continuallychanges with experience.312 Several studies based on RNA-seq assays and bioinformatic analyses have showed strikingtranscriptomic differences in the ventral and dorsal hippocam-pus in the responses to stress—a primary risk factor for multiplepsychiatric diseases—with the ventral hippocampus being sen-sitive not only to the effects of stress313 but also a target for theresponses to next-generation anti-depressants.314,315The expansion of NGS to single-cell resolution assays providesopportunities for advanced bioinformatics and ML approaches toanalyze large datasets, which include denoising and dimension-ality reduction, cell-type classification, gene regulatory networkinference, and multi-modal data integration.316,317 For instance,the software toolkit for single-cell genomics, Seurat (https://satijalab.org/seurat/), combines unsupervised non-linear dimen-sionality reduction, K-nearest neighbor graph analysis for cell-type clustering, and weighted nearest-neighbor analysis formulti-modal data integration.318 Deep-learning approaches,such as the deep autoencoder, provide analytic tools for denois-ing and dimensionality reduction.319–321 Autoencoders can alsobe used in a supervised manner for transfer learning across data-sets, such as to learn the embedding from a larger previouslyannotated dataset and to transfer this knowledge to clusternew datasets.322 The combination of multi-modal data generatedfrom the simultaneous assessment of transcriptomic profilesReviewABFigure 10.

Instead,growing evidence has suggested that they are system-level disor-ders affecting multiple interacting biological pathways,327involving dynamic cross-talk between the brain and the body. Us-ing hierarchical clustering to integrate in vivo molecular measuresof brain metabolism with clinical symptoms in patients with MDD,recent work has showed that the specific neurobiological sub-strates map into discrete clinical symptoms, including anhe-donia.328 Furthermore, the integration of multi-dimensional factorsspanning mitochondrial metabolism, cellular aging, metabolicfunction, and childhood trauma may provide more detailed signa-tures than individual factors to predict longitudinal changes indepression severity in response to the metabolic agents used asanti-depressant treatment.329 Furthermore, deployment of multi-omics approaches and a random forest classifier has achieved85% sensitivity and 77% specificity in prediction of the PTSD sta-tus. This system-level diagnostic panel of multiple molecular andphysiological measures outperformed separate panels composedof each individual data type, showing certain mitochondrial metab-olites as the most important predictors.330,331Another example of ML applications includes the integration ofmulti-dimensional phenotypic measures to identify those mecha-nisms that pre-dispose apparently healthy individuals to developmaladaptive coping strategies from those that confer resilience. Arecent study has used a high-throughput unbiased automatedphenotyping platform to collects more than 2,000 behavioral fea-tures and applied supervised ML to minimize Bayesian misclassi-llOPEN ACCESSfication probability. The results have demonstrated that such arich set of behavioral alterations can distinguish susceptibleversus resilient phenotypes after exposure to social defeat stress(SDS) in rodents.332,333 Furthermore, the ML classifier may inte-grate a priori constructs (such as the measures of anxiety and im-mune system function) and predict whether a given animal devel-oped SDS-induced social withdrawal or remained resilient.Additionally, integration of features can improve the classificationsensitivity ((cid:3)80%), which is better than the performance derivedfrom either individual measure alone.334The development of personalized psychiatry strategies fordiagnosis and treatment will benefit from meeting the demandenforced by the recent advent of molecular biology protocols,which may provide opportunities to capture CNS nanovesicles(known as exosomes) and examine specific neurobiological sub-transcriptomic profiles). ML-based dynamicstrates (e.g.,network analyses will also enable us to link brain molecular tar-gets and signaling pathways with other levels of analyses andto incorporate the brain-body relationship to redefine thinkingabout the mechanisms throughout the complex disease course.XAI IN PSYCHIATRYXAI aims to provide strong predictive values along with a mecha-nistic understanding of AI by combining ML techniques with effec-tive explanatory techniques. XAI has found emergent applicationsin medicine, finance, economy, security, and defense.335,336 Inpsychiatry, XAI can help clarify the link between neural circuitsand behavior and improve our understanding of therapeutic stra-tegies to enhance cognitive, affective, and social functions.337,338XAI distinguishes the standard AI in two important ways: (1) it pro-motes transparency, interpretability, and generalizability and (2)transforms classical ‘‘black box’’ ML models into ‘‘glass box’’models while achieving comparable or improved performance.From the diagnosis or prognosis perspective, it is crucial toknow whether the ML solutions are explainable to the point ofproviding mechanistic insights into the way brains execute aparticular function or complex behaviors. For instance, an ML-produced classification function to predict a disease outcomewould need to not only report a probability outcome but alsoaddress additional questions for the end user: why is it thisoutcome instead of the alternative? How reliable is the outcome?When will it fail if something is missing or misrepresented? Whenand why is the prediction wrong? Accordingly, a model with highinterpretability is often accompanied with parameter/structure/connectivity constraints or some prior domain knowledge. Theseexplainable models can be continuously adapted such that aniterative process may be required to force ML methods to fitmodels with specific interpretations.Interpretability and interpretable ML modelsA model is interpretable if its outcome and operation that leads tothe outcome can be understood by human users. In terms of tax-onomy, intrinsic interpretability of ML models is attributed to theirsimple structures, such as short decision trees or sparse linearmodels (Figure 10A). Post-hoc interpretability is referred to theapplication of interpretation methods after model training339 (on-linehttps://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/). Interpretation may appear in different forms: (1) finiteresource:Patterns 3, November 11, 2022 21llOPEN ACCESSfeature summary statistics, (2) meaningful model parameters, or(3) easy visualization of the model outcome (e.g., feature sum-mary or decision boundary). Interpretability and explainabilityare two similar concepts and are sometimes used interchange-ably. Interpretability often, but not always, implies explainability.A modelis highly explainable if it shares at least one of thefollowing properties of explainability:339 high portability(regarding the range where the model can be applied), highexpressive power (regarding the model strength in explainingthe outcome), low translucency (regarding the model depen-dency on specific conditions), low algorithmic complexity, andinformative constraints. Generally, there is a trade-off betweenmodel explainablity and performance. For instance, a con-strained linear or bilinear model may fit many of these criteria,but the linear model does not warrant a good performance. Addi-tionally, a model that is potentially explainable does not guar-antee explainability. For example, codependence of input vari-ables may make explanations ambiguous; latent variables ofprobabilistic generative models may face the problem of ‘‘ex-plaining away.’’340 Here, we briefly mention several classes ofinterpretable ML models.Hybrid rule-based ML modelsThis type of ML models can be used for generating rules, such asa decision rule set: IF (condition) THEN (outcome 1) ELSE(outcome 2) statement, where the conditional clause will belearned from data.341 This type of model has more expressivepower but less portability.Constrained ML modelsThis type of ML models imposes parameter constraints to avoidoverfitting and enhance interpretability. Examples of suchinclude the constrained convolutional filters in the CNN model342or constrained mixture models used for clustering.343 As a result,these constrained models have low translucency.Feedback ML modelsML models can be provided with user feedback in the human-in-the-loop system, where the user feedback is treated as aconstraint in the optimization problem.344,345 The feedbackmay appear as a form of rule sets that are either known or un-known in advance. Feedback can also help interpolate missingdata and constrain the solution. Iterating feedback-rule optimi-zation steps can generate more accurate rule sets. This type ofmodel has good expressive power and high portability.Circuit-level modeling for computational psychiatryRooted in ML, computational psychiatry shares a similar goalwith XAI and tries to combine multiple levels and types ofcomputation with behavioral and neuroimaging data in an effortto improve understanding, prediction, and treatment of mentalillness.346 The levels of computation range from short to longtimescales (min/h/days/weeks) and focus on the changes inbrain activity and behavior. The types of computation include cir-cuit-level modeling, data-driven analytics, and theory-drivenalgorithmic development. Two complementary approacheshave been proposed in computational psychiatry: (1) data-drivenapproaches, which apply ML methods to high-dimensionalmulti-modal data to tackle classification and prediction prob-lems (how can ML help psychiatry?), and (2) theory-driven ap-proaches (such as reinforcement learning), which develop algo-rithmic or mechanistic models to test hypotheses.22 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022ReviewIn the second approach, an important research topic is circuit-level computational modeling of macroscopic or mesoscopicbrain dynamics for mentally ill brains in task or resting-state con-ditions.347–349 A common strategy is to first use a biologicallyinspired model to simulate neural activity based on a networkof interacting neural masses and next, within each brain area,to model the neuronal population activity as the Wilson-Cowanneural mass model, with each consisting of excitatory and inhib-itory populations.350 Furthermore, individual brain nodes arecoupled together according to the empirically derived anatom-ical network.351 The computational model can be driven by anempirical hypothesis or EEG/fMRI data.One data-driven macroscopic-level modeling approach is dy-namic causal modeling (DCM). DCM has been widely used incharacterizing the effective connectivity of a functional networkbased on task or rs-fMRI,352,353 where the model parametersare inferred from unsupervised learning. By incorporating priorknowledge or hypotheses of network connections, DCM mayreveal important brain mechanisms and offer experimental pre-dictions. One potential application of DCM is to characterizethe neural plasticity in human brains, especially the change infunctional connectivity informed by neuroimaging studies. Thefunctional connectivity can either change gradually during thecourse of tasks or be induced by neurostimulation. Thesechanges are often, but not always, associated with changes infunctional activation of specific brain regions.CLOSING THE LOOP FOR TESTING CAUSALITYTHROUGH NEUROSTIMULATIONitis criticalFrom the treatment perspective,to obtain animproved understanding of brain dynamics that are responsiblefor dysfunctional cognitive functions and maladaptive behaviorsin mental illnesses. To find the hidden cause, the concept of cau-sality requires special attention in perturbing the brain activity.Because of the complexity of the human brain and brain-behavior relationship, adaptive closed-loop neurostimulationprovides a critical step to understand healthy and diseasedbrains.354,355Neuroimaging provides a passive sensing approach toobserve the (correlational) brain-behavior relationship. However,correlation is different from causation. Correlational depen-dencies describe associations of measurements that experi-ments do not control, whereas causal dependencies link adependent variable to an experimentally controlled variable.The key concept in causal inference is to introduce randomiza-tion to perturb the mapping. The relationship between everydependable variable and the randomized variable is causal,whereas the relationship between non-randomized variablesand behavior remains correlational.356 A closed-loop experi-mental design would help to test the potential causality.354 In hu-man experiments, we classify closed-loop testing into two cate-gories: one being fully automated, and the other being closedhuman in the loop.One big challenge in human psychiatric neuroscience is thecausality gap.357 Statistical causality or Granger causality be-tween two variables is not equivalent to brain-behavioral causal-ity. To identify an effective treatment strategy for mentalill-nesses, it is critical to causally modulate neural circuitry that isReviewresponsible for maladaptive behaviors. Human neuroimagingalone only demonstrates correlations but not causation. To un-derstand the causal mechanisms, it is imperative to close theloop in experiments by perturbing the brain circuits andmeasuring its outcome, as commonly done in animal experi-ments.354,356 Unfortunately, a rigorous and causal grounding ofclinical symptoms and behavior is still missing. Since the clinicalsymptoms are diverse, how to define the dimension of brainfunction that defines one or few clinical symptoms and how toeffectively manipulate them remains unknown. Furthermore,closed-loop neurostimulation has a conceptual link to XAI formental health studies and can be seen as an extension in thedesign of human brain-machine interface (BMI) to causally testbrain-behavior mapping.358Neuromodulation therapies have become increasingly popularin treating various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.Temporally precise neurostimulation tools provide a plausiblemeans to perturb or stimulate the brain. Clinically used neuromo-dulation methods include invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS),non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), non-inva-sive transcranial direct/alternating current stimulation (tDCS/tACS), and transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS).A review of advances in neuromodulation technologies for treat-ing mental disorders can be found in the literature.359–361 Todate, repetitive TMS (rTMS) has been cleared by the FDA forthe treatment of depression and has recently been used instudies of neural functioning and behavior.362,363 Along thisresearch line, ML may potentially help addressing three impor-tant questions (where/when/how) to achieve precision neuromo-dulation in psychiatry.For the where question, depending on the neuromodualtiontechniques, delivery of target-specific stimulation requires activeand scheduled stimulation strategies to identify behaviorallyactivated targets. In the case of depression, neurostimulationcan have multiple potential targets or modes of action,364 buthow to identify the optimal target to achieve effective treatmentoutcomes remains unexplored. For the when and how questions,compared with open-loop stimulation, closed-loop stimulationcan deliver temporally precise stimulation triggered by detectedfeatures, symptoms, or user demand. Traditional neurostimula-tion strategies are designed in an on/off stimulation fashion,where the stimulation is determined by pre-selected parameters.However, these stimulation parameters may not be optimal. Toaccommodate an adaptive subject-specific stimulation strategy,adaptive stimulation uses neurofeedback to adjust the stimula-tion parameters or control policy to achieve various optimalitycriteria. Therefore, ML can play a guiding role in online adaptivestimulation.365–367 For instance, the feedback loop can analyzethe neural signal’s oscillatory patterns or other reliably detect-able biosignals (e.g., biochemcial, electromyographic, and me-chanical signals) to classify or detect the critical brain state fordelivery of closed-loop neurostimulation.368 Additionally, rein-forcement learning can be applied to learn a state-action valuefunction to identify the best excitability brain state, where thestate corresponds to the neural activity (e.g., the amplitude ofevoked potentials, characteristics of brain connectivity) and theaction corresponds to on/off stimulation mode.367,369Neurostimulation can not only induce changes in behavior butcan also induce plasticity in brain connectivity. Simultaneous orllOPEN ACCESSpost-neurostimulation neuroimaging provides a window ofexamining the change in brain network connectivity patterns.Brain connectivity and dynamics can be studied from a networkcommunication and control perspective.370,371 The distinctionbetween a healthy and a pathological brain can be characterizedby their different efficiency to route information between distrib-uted brain nodes, to control or modulate the target node underspecific constraints, or to influence its behavior for performingspecific tasks (‘‘cognitive control’’).372 Therefore, the well-estab-lished network and graph theories can be used to study thechange in brain connectivity by a controller (neurostimulator).Specifically, the control-theoretic models have also been appliedto quantify the response of brain networks to exogenous andendogenous perturbations. Severalimportant research ques-tions can be studied along this line: (1) can a target node stimu-lation rewire brain connectivity in evoked and steady-state con-ditions? (2) Can the neurostimulation-induced change of evokedor resting-state brain connectivity distinguish a pathologicalfrom a healthy brain? (3) Given a controller’s energy constraint,what is the optimal neurostimulation policy? Will alternate orsimultaneous neurostimulations at multiple sites influence thenetwork connectivity more effectively or bring additional benefitin treatment373? (4) Can the induced brain patterns or changes innetwork connectivity predict the treatment outcome? ML mayaddress these questions by providing individualized treatment-response likelihood in precision psychiatry.374Finally, we suggest that combining multiple efforts of XAIand neurostimulation in the loop (‘‘neuroimaging / circuitmodeling / neurostimulation / observing behaviors /revising models’’; Figure 10B) will provide an effective pathwaytoward a better understanding of brain-behavior causation aswell as individualized precision treatment in psychiatry. Forinstance, looping neuromodulation and DCM may provide away to test the impact of neurostimulation on neural plasticitythat underlies the change in adaptive or maladaptive behaviors.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONChallenge and opportunitiesThe past few decades have witnessed growing interests andrapid developments in ML methods for precision psychiatry.However, caution was also raised regarding the unrealistichope for ML applications in clinical practice,182,375 and the fieldis still facing both conceptual and practical challenges.At the conceptual level, first, the term disorder was used tospecifically avoid the term disease, implying that precise mech-anistic understanding is still missing in psychiatry; this furthermakes it very difficult to build clinical inference models for mentaldisorders. As a result, it is still infeasible to develop treatmentsthat target underlying physiological risk factors in a similarmanner as other medical disciplines (e.g., treating hypertensionin heart diseases). Furthermore, each mental disorder has over-lapping symptoms with varying degrees, bringing difficulties touniquely define the psychiatric disorder. Second, many disor-ders are presented as a spectrum (e.g., ASD, generalized anxietyspectrum, and schizophrenia spectrum) and vary acrossdifferent patients, creating a wide range of subtypes and subjectvariability within the same type of mental disorder. Third, due tovarious genetic, biochemical, and neuropathological factors, thePatterns 3, November 11, 2022 23llOPEN ACCESSsame mental disorder may have different causes and symptomsin different age/gender/race populations. Fourth, overlappingsymptoms can be found in many mental disorders, making thediagnosis less precise or more error prone.376 For example,changes in sleep and energy level, often found in depressionand generally measured using the PHQ-9 questionnaire, arevery common across many other disorders. One goal in preci-sion psychiatry is to fully dissect the mechanisms and causallyreveal the many-to-one relationship. This can be catalyzed byrigorous measurements and quantification of neural and behav-ioral data relevant to mental health.At the practical level, many challenges also remain in effectiveapplications of ML for mental health.Sample sizeDatasets used in many ML applications have a small samplesize, especially by the standard of ML-based speech/image/video applications. Neuroimaging data collection from mentalhealth patients is limited to one-shot examples, which createslarge data variability in addition to the intrinsic heterogeneityand disease comorbidity. Recent developments in foundationmodels and their mental health applications may help overcomethis challenge—for example, by sharing the pre-trained languagemodel.223 However, further caution is needed to ensure appro-priate validation methods on the problem-specific data. Repro-ducibility is the main bottleneck to biomarker discovery for anymental disorder.Data qualityThe lack of standardization in data acquisition and varying de-grees of data quality present a challenge in rigor and reproduc-ibility. For example, studies using social media data often relyon the mental disorder labels based on users’ self-identificationinstead of rigorous clinical diagnosis. This can lead to a post con-taining ‘‘I am depressed’’ being labeled as a depression sampleregardless of the underlying clinical symptoms. Terms such asdepressed or anxious have colloquial uses that can differ fromclinical criteria, leading to inaccurately labeled samples. Further-more, collection of properly matched control samples remainsdifficult given the diversity of age, gender, race, education, familyhistory, and lifestyle among users. Furthermore, there are alsointrinsic dataset biases during data collection.377Data privacy and securityAdvances in sensing technologies enable us to collect a largeamount of personal data, including location, face images, speechconversations, and social interactions. However, how to store andprocess these data without the leakage risk of privacy informationremains an important challenge. While research studies have rulesand regulations (e.g., internal review board) to ensure ethical use,social media data are collected on a massive scale by companies.Due to the lack of sufficient regulation, such data have not beentreated as personally identifiable information (PII) that can beused to inform the user’s health, creating a major obstacle insecuring identifiable user data. To help alleviate this issue, regula-tions in the United States such as the Health Insurance Portabilityand Accountability Act (HIPAA) can be used to govern PII acquiredby all social media companies and commercial entities.Social implications and environmental factorsGender and race are critical factors in mental health. Accordingto WHO, mental disorders have a long history of gender bias. Interms of the gender risk factor, females are more likely to suffer24 Patterns 3, November 11, 2022Reviewfrom depression and anxiety, whereas there is more prevalenceof autism in males. In terms of gender treatment bias, women aremore likely to be diagnosed with depression compared withmen, and women are more likely to be prescribed with mood-altering psychotropic drugs. ML may play a role in uncoveringthe gender or race risk factor and minimize the diagnosis or treat-ment bias related to these social factors.GeneralizabilityThe standard ML generalization issue becomes even more pro-nounced in mental health applications, especially due to the poordata quality and small sample size. Most ML studies use cross-validation to report the performance but lack independent vali-dation datasets to assess generalizability. Furthermore, veryfew studies test generalization across data sources and experi-mental conditions. For example, it is important to test how wellinterviewsML models trained from speech data from clinicalwill perform on non-clinical speech data.Algorithmic biasDigital mental health inherits a long history of bias in psychiatry,which can be found at all stages of a patient journey.378 In addi-tion to biological underpinnings, the domains of data (such aslanguage) also represent social underpinnings,379 and thereforeit is important to consider how socioeconomic factors may influ-ence measurements. Using training and validation sets that arerepresentative across all demographics can not only helpaddress some of these issues but also uncover new symptomexpressions in various groups. This is even more important forML approaches that inherit biases from other ML models.InterpretabilityThe ability to understand which latent factors contribute most tothe outcome is the key for advancing clinical understanding ofmental disorders for mental health professionals as well as forestablishing the trust for the users of mental health technology.This is also an important dimension to improve precision inmental health. The choice of the interpretation method,338 eithermodel specific (such as analyzing attention weights of a trans-former) or model agnostic (such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations [LIME]), is very specific to the nature ofthe problem. While various interpretation methods can be usedto identify model functioning, it is important to note that the inter-pretation results can only be trusted as long as the issues ofgeneralizability and data quality are addressed. In other words,model interpretation methods may produce erratic results withinsufficient or poor-quality data. Furthermore, there is alwaysan ‘‘explainability-performance’’ trade-off. For instance, deeplearning may outperform traditional methods at the cost ofreduced interpretability. Despite the rapid progress in the devel-opment of XAI and interpretable ML techniques, the challenge ofML explainability still remains in psychiatric applications, espe-cially when dealing with data of mixed modality, data of highdimensionality, and data measured at varying timescales.Causal inferenceMost ML applications in mental health have focused on inte-grating information from multiple data sources and reaching adiagnosis decision faster. However, diagnosing a mental disor-der, even with a highly interpretable model, neither speaks tothe underlying causes nor has limited implications on treatingthe causes. ML-based causal inference methods380 may helpwith precision treatment design.381 Recent developments inReviewfor successfulultra-high-field neuroimaging with sufficient temporal and spatialresolution382 may provide a means for developing inferencemodels for mental disorders.Clinical integrationIt is important to consider the clinical need from a user experi-ence perspective, varying from the mental health professionalsusing the application383 to patients who are mentally ill.384 Partof this work, such as conducting user research in various demo-graphics, lies outside of the ML domain; however, such cross-functional research can inform the best practice in ML modeldevelopment. This type of thinking with the end goal in mind istranslation of precision psychiatryimportantresearch to widespread clinical practice.385 Additionally, consid-ering a possible disparity of interests between the clinical and MLcommunities,377 cross-disciplinary dialogues and collaborationsbetween two communities would help the deployment of ML so-lutions in clinical practice.Ethical considerationsML applications in mental health also raise important ethical con-siderations. For example, ML models for risk assessment canlead to early screening that may help with early treatment.11However, when screening techniques are available outside clin-ical settings, it can create the risk of misinterpretation by pa-tients, which may negatively affect treatment-seeking behavioror trigger self-harming thoughts in patients. Other ethical ques-tions related to increasing the risk of self-harm arise inherentlyfrom ML that use foundation models like Generative Pre-trainedTransformer 3 (GPT-3), which should be fully considered beforedeployment in clinical settings.386Applications of new ML technologiesIn addition to the opportunities arising from addressing theabove-mentioned challenges, precision psychiatry is accompa-nied by plenty of opportunities in future ML applications.Data-centric approachIn the data-driven ML view (‘‘ML system = model/algorithm +data’’), data are powerful. However, medical data are costly tocollect and noisy. Currently, there is an ML paradigm shift frommodel centric to data centric (https://datacentricai.org/), whichadvocates using good ‘‘small’’ data instead of simply collectingfrom big, but possibly noisy, data. The good-quality criteriainclude (1) consistency, (2) coverage of important cases, and (3)inclusion of timely feedback from user or production data. Unlikethe model-centric ML approach that focuses on modifying themodel/algorithm (while fixing the data) to improve the perfor-mance, a data-centric ML approach involves building ML sys-tems with quality data, with a goal to systematically process thedata (while fixing the model) to improve the ML performance.387The modification of the available data may include data regener-ation, data augmentation, and label refinement strategies toimprove data consistency. For instance, confident learning hasbeen proposed to estimate label uncertainty and identify label er-rors, based on the principles of pruning noisy data, counting withprobabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and ranking examplesto train with confidence.388 The iterative process of two ap-proaches can bootstrap the system performance.Data augmentation approachTo deal with the small sample size issue in patient data collec-tion, one ML approach is to create synthetic data (as a datallOPEN ACCESSaugmentation strategy) or increase the number of training in-stances.389 Deep-learning methods such as GAN and its variantshave served as a powerful tool to generate synthetic brain scanimages, speech, video, physiological data, and EHRs.390–392However, unlike traditional ML/computer vision studies, thevalue of synthetic training samples remains unclear in psychiatricapplications. Whether ML-augmented samples can generateclinically meaningful and diversified samples that match psychi-atric heterogeneity would require future in-depth investigations.Automated-learning approachIn contrast to the human-in-the-loop solutions, automated ML(autoML) and automated deep learning (autoDL) represent anew paradigm that aims to automate the data analysis pipelinewhile minimizing the need of human intervention during thecourse of modeling and training.393 This has become increas-ingly important since the volume of social media and multi-mediadata streams is so overwhelming that even a small effort of hu-man involvement would make the task prohibitive.Data-integration approachIntegration of multi-modal data is critical for psychiatric diagnos-tics and monitoring. Therefore, it is urgently needed to developweakly supervised,interpretable, multi-modal deep-learningpipelines to fuse histopathology, genomics, neuroimaging, andbehavioral data, as well as to develop multi-modal fusion algo-rithms for speech, video, and EHRs, to assist both psychiatristsand patients. Because of the nature of multi-modality, not alldata can be quantified in the Euclidean space. Graph and geo-metric deep learning may play a role in this research direc-tion.394,395 Finally, expert-augmented ML (EAML) methods thatautomatically extract problem-specific human expert knowl-edge and integrate it with ML to build robust, dependable, anddata-efficient predictive models will also have great potentialsfor psychiatric applications.396ConclusionTo date, there is still a lack of biomarkers and individualizedtreatment guidelines for mentalillnesses. In this review, wehave shown that ML technologies and data analytics can beused for various stages of a patient journey: detection/diagnosis,prognosis,treatment selection/optimization, outcome moni-toring/tracking, and relapse prevention. We predict that themulti-modal integration of neuroimaging, ML, genetics, behav-ioral neuroscience, and mobile health will open doors for newmethod developments and technology inventions. First, makingbrain scans more accessible will be the key to clinical applica-tions of neuroimaging techniques. Using real-time fMRI, MLcan guide neurofeedback-based intervention and provideclosed-loop treatment or rehabilitation. As a ‘‘real-time mirror’’of psychiatry, mind-control intervention can improve behavioraloutcomes. Second, data-driven ML methods can identify sub-types of symptoms and cognitive deficits and develop model-based phenotyping.397 Third, combination of ML methods withlarge EHR databases may accommodate a personalized psychi-atry. Fourth, when developing ML-powered technologies forpsychiatry, it is imperative to consider concerns and feedbackfrom various stakeholders,including knowledgeable experts(clinical and ML experts, technology or engineer experts), deci-sion-makers (hospital administrators, institutional leaders, stateand federal governments), and end users (physicians, nurses,Patterns 3, November 11, 2022 25llOPEN ACCESSpatients, friends, and family).398 Finally, an integration of medica-tions, wearable devices, mobile health apps, social support, andonline education will be essential to improve mental health andassist therapeutic outcomes in the new era of digital psychiatry.Future precision psychiatry will leverage ML and all technologiesto provide individualized custom packages that are built uponthe patient’s needs and specific pathology.BIOGRAPHYZhe Sage Chen is an associate professor at the New YorkUniversity School of Medicine, with joint appointment at theDepartments of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Physiologyand the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the NYUTandon School of Engineering.
