EEG  fingerprinting:  subject  specific  signature  based  on  the  aperiodic  component  of power  spectrum Matteo  Demuru 1  and  Matteo  Fraschini 2 1  Stichting  Epilepsie  Instellingen  Nederland  (SEIN),  Heemstede,  The  Netherlands  2  Department  of  Electrical  and  Electronic  Engineering,  University  of  Cagliari,  Cagliari,  Italy Corresponding  author:  Matteo  Fraschini  (e-mail:  fraschin@unica.it). Abstract During  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  growing  interest  in  the  effects  induced  by  individual  variability  on activation  patterns  and  brain  connectivity.  The  practical  implications  of  individual  variability  is  of  basic relevance  for  both  group  level  and  subject  level  studies.  The  Electroencephalogram  (EEG),  still  represents  one of  the  most  used  recording  techniques  to  investigate  a  wide  range  of  brain  related  features.  In  this  work,  we  aim to  estimate  the  effect  of  individual  variability  on  a  set  of  very  simple  and  easily  interpretable  features  extracted from  the  EEG  power  spectra.  In  particular,  in  an  identification  scenario,  we  investigated  how  the  aperiodic  (1/f background)  component  of  the  EEG  power  spectra  can  accurately  identify  subjects  from  a  large  EEG  dataset. The  results  of  this  study  show  that  the  aperiodic  component  of  the  EEG  signal  is  characterized  by  strong subject-specific  properties,  that  this  feature  is  consistent  across  different  experimental  conditions  (eyes-open  and eyes-closed)  and  outperforms  the  canonically-defined  frequency  bands.  These  findings  suggest  that  the  simple features  (slope  and  offset)  extracted  from  the  aperiodic  component  of  the  EEG  signal  are  sensitive  to  individual traits  and  may  help  to  characterize  and  make  inferences  at  single  subject  level.  Keywords:  EEG;  fingerprint;  power  spectra;  aperiodic  component.  1      Introduction The  scalp  electroencephalogram  (EEG)  represents  the  most  common  recording  system  to  detect  human  brain activity.  Despite  this  technique  dates  back  to  more  than  a  century  ago,  it  still  remains  a  clear  reference  in  all  the neuroscience  related  fields  (Lopes  da  Silva  2013) .  One  of  the  most  relevant  advantages  of  EEG,  compared  to other  well-known  techniques  as  Magnetoencephalography  (MEG)  and  functional  magnetic  resonance  (fMRI),  is represented  by  its  relative  low-cost  and  its  non-invasive  properties  that  makes  it  especially  suitable  for  real  life applications.  Merit  of  these  characteristics,  more  recently,  the  use  of  scalp  EEG  has  been  extensively investigated  as  source  of  neurophysiological  features  to  be  used  in  the  so  called  cognitive  biometric  systems (Chan  et  al.  2018;  Gui  et  al.  2019) .  To  date,  an  impressive  number  of  feature  extraction  techniques  have  been used  with  the  aim  to  detect  subject-specific  traits  from  EEG  recordings.  Time,  frequency,  time-frequency -domain  techniques,  functional  connectivity  metrics  and  the  related  derived  network  parameters  have  been extensively  investigated  into  this  specific  research  topic.  Among  these  techniques,  the  most  frequently  used derive  either  from  the  use  of  power  spectral  density  analysis  at  channels  level  (DelPozo-Banos  et  al.  2015; Rocca  et  al.  2014)  or  from  functional  connectivity  between  EEG  channels  (Barra  et  al.  2017;  Crobe  et  al.  2016; Fraschini  et  al.  2015) .  All  these  approaches,  from  the  most  simple  to  the  most  sophisticated,  are  based  on  some sort  of  arbitrary  choice,  such  as  (i)  the  frequency  band  definition,  (ii)  the  selection  of  a  correlation  metric  for  the connectivity  and/or  (iii)  the  application  of  a  threshold  to  reconstruct  the  functional  network.  Interestingly,  it  has been  shown  that  EEG  brain  activity  exhibits  a  1/f-like  power  spectrum  (He  2014) ,  defining  an  aperiodic component  that  may  be  characterized  in  terms  of  slope  (i.e.,  the  exponential  decrease  of  power  in  a  spectrogram as  a  function  of  frequency)  and  offset  (i.e.,  offset  of  the  broadband  power  of  the  signal).  This  arrhythmic  brain activity  has  been  associated  with  fluctuations  of  cognitive  states  (Podvalny  et  al.  2015) ,  aging  (Voytek  et  al. 2015) ,  firing  rate  of  neural  populations  (Manning  et  al.  2009)  and  clinical  conditions  (Peterson  et  al.  2018; Robertson  et  al.  2019;  Veerakumar  et  al.  2019) .  Despite  the  interest  on  this  specific  approach,  to  the  best  of  our knowledge,  it  has  not  been  investigated  yet  to  what  extent  this  aperiodic  component  depicts  the  individual variability  in  EEG  brain  activity.  In  this  study,  we  quantified  the  aperiodic  component  of  the  power  spectrum, estimating  the  spectral  slope  and  the  offset  at  channel  level.  Successively,  we  used  these  EEG  characteristics  as feature  vector  to  identify  subjects  in  a  large  EEG  dataset.  Finally,  we  compared  the  results  obtained  from  the aperiodic  component  with  those  obtained  from  more  classical  power  spectral  features,  namely  the  relative  power extracted  from  the  canonical  EEG  frequency  bands  (i.e,  theta,  alpha,  beta  and  gamma  bands).  In  order  to investigate  this  question,  we  used  resting-state  traces  from  a  large  and  publicly  available  EEG  dataset  consisting of  several  recordings  from  109  different  subjects  using  a  64  channel  EEG  equipment  (Goldberger  Ary  L.  et  al. 2000;  Schalk  et  al.  2004) . 2   Material  and  methods Dataset To  test  our  hypothesis  we  use  a  large  and  publicly  available  (https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/) EEG  dataset  consisting  of  several  recordings  from  109  different  subjects  using  high-density  EEG  equipment (Goldberger  Ary  L.  et  al.  2000;  Schalk  et  al.  2004) .  The  EEG  traces  are  provided  in  EDF+  format,  containing  64 EEG  signals  and  sampled  at  160  samples  per  second.  In  particular,  since  the  possible  effects  on  individual variability  of  different  sessions  and  different  tasks  have  already  been  investigated  (Fraschini  et  al.  2019;  Pani  et al.  2019)  and  are  out  of  the  scope  of  the  present  work,  we  focused  our  analysis  on  the  two  (one  minute  long) resting-state  recordings  during  eyes-closed  and  eyes-open  conditions. Preprocessing The  preprocessing  procedure  was  organized  in  two  main  steps.  The  first  step  was  to  apply  ADJUST  (version 1.1.1,  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/adjust/),  an  automatic  algorithm  for  artifact  identification  and  removal (Mognon  et  al.  2011)  based  on  Independent  Component  Analysis  (ICA),  with  the  aim  to  reduce  the  effects  due to  blinks,  eye  movements  and  other  generic  discontinuities.  The  subjects  that  showed  significant  residual artifacts  were  excluded  from  the  analysis,  in  particular,  the  reported  results  are  based  on  95  subjects  for  the eyes-open  condition  and  100  subjects  for  the  eyes-closed  condition.  The  second  step  was  to  segment  each  (one minute)  resting-state  EEG  recordings  into  five  non-overlapping  epochs  of  12  seconds  (Fraschini  et  al.  2015; Fraschini  et  al.  2016) .  Features  extraction After  the  preprocessing  steps,  two  different  types  of  features  were  extracted  from  the  epoched  signals:  (i) features  characterizing  the  aperiodic  component,  namely  the  slope  and  the  offset  and  (ii)  features  characterizing the  periodic  component,  namely  the  relative  power  of  theta  [4-8  Hz],  alpha  [8-13  Hz],  beta  [13-30  Hz]  and gamma  [30-45  Hz]  frequency  bands.  The  slope  and  the  offset  were  calculated  using  the  Fitting  Oscillations  & One  Over  f  (FOOOF)  toolbox  (Haller  et  al.  2018) .  The  relative  power  for  each  frequency  band  has  been computed  as  the  ratio  between  the  absolute  band-specific  power  and  absolute  total  power  (between  1  and  45  Hz) using  the  Power  Spectral  Density  estimate  via  Welch's  method.  Both  approaches  allowed  to  obtain,  for  each subject  and  each  epoch,  a  features  vector  of  64  entries  (each  one  representing  the  corresponding  slope,  offset  or relative  power  of  a  single  EEG  channel). Performance  evaluation To  assess  the  performance  of  the  two  approaches  (periodic  and  aperiodic  components  of  the  power  spectra)  to capture  subject  specific  characteristics,  we  have  tested  the  extracted  features  using  a  well  known  paradigm generally  used  to  evaluate  biometric  systems  (Fraschini  et  al.  2015) .  In  particular,  genuine  and  impostor  scores were  computed  based  on  the  Euclidean  distance  between  pairs  of  feature  vectors.  Later,  a  similarity  score  was computed  as  1/(1+d),  where  d  represents  the  Euclidean  distance.  Finally,  the  performance  were  derived  from  the 3   false  acceptance  rate  (FAR,  the  error  that  occurs  when  the  system  accepts  an  impostor)  and  the  false  rejection rate  (FRR,  the  error  that  occurs  when  the  system  rejects  a  genuine  match)  at  different  thresholds.  The  area  under the  receiver  operating  characteristic  (AUC)  curves  were  evaluated  together  with  the  equal  error  rate  (EER,  the point  where  FAR  equals  FRR)  and  reported  to  summarize  the  results.  Low  values  of  EER  and  AUC  express  high performance.  All  the  analysis  was  performed  using  Matlab  (The  MathWorks,  Inc.,  Natick,  Massachusetts, United  States,  version  2017B)  and  EEGLAB  (version  13)  (Delorme  and  Makeig  2004) .  All  the  figures  were realized  using  Jamovi  (version  1.0.8.0)  available  from  https://www.jamovi.org. 4    Results Eyes-open  resting-state For  the  eyes-open  resting-state  condition,  the  best  performance,  in  terms  of  EER  and  AUC,  were  obtained  for the  offset  (EER  =  0.079  and  AUC  =  0.025).  The  slope  performed  slightly  worse,  with  EER  =  0.090  and  AUC  = 0.031.  Figure  1  represents  the  similarity  score  distribution  for  the  slope  (left  panel)  and  the  offset  (right  panel). When  the  two  feature  vectors  were  concatenated,  the  performance  was  slightly  better  with  EER  =  0.063  and AUC  =  0.019.  The  relative  power  feature  vectors  did  not  show  comparable  performance,  with  the  best  results obtained  for  beta  (EER  =  0.118  and  AUC  =  0.043)  and  gamma  band  (EER  =  0.112  and  AUC  =  0.039).  All  the results  for  eyes-open  resting-state  condition  are  summarized  in  Table  1. Figure  1.

A  summary  of  the  EER  values  for  each  feature  vector. 5     Eyes-closed  resting-state For  the  eyes-closed  resting-state  condition,  the  best  performance,  in  terms  of  EER  and  AUC,  were  obtained  for the  offset  (EER  =  0.057  and  AUC  =  0.018).  The  slope  performed  slightly  worse,  with  EER  =  0.089  and  AUC  = 0.035.  Figure  2  represents  the  similarity  score  distribution  for  the  slope  (left  panel)  and  the  offset  (right  panel). In  this  case,  when  the  two  feature  vectors  were  concatenated,  the  performance  was  slightly  worse  with  EER  = 0.171  and  AUC  =  0.019.  Again,  the  relative  power  feature  vectors  did  not  show  comparable  performance,  with the  best  results  obtained  for  beta  (EER  =  0.142  and  AUC  =  0.078)  and  gamma  band  (EER  =  0.197  and  AUC  = 0.124).  All  the  results  for  eyes-closed  resting-state  condition  are  summarized  in  Table  2. Figure  2.

A  summary  of  the  EER  values  for  each  feature  vector. 6     Discussion In  this  study,  a  large  and  open  EEG  dataset  is  used  to  investigate  inter-subject  variability  using  a  fast  and  easy approach  that  goes  beyond  the  traditional  frequency  band  analysis.  Two  simple  characteristics  (slope  and  offset of  the  broadband  power  spectrum)  describing  the  aperiodic  properties  of  the  EEG  signals  were  exploited  as fingerprints  to  identify  individuals.  Our  results  show  that  the  aperiodic  component  of  the  power  spectrum  (i)  is characterized  by  strong  subject-specific  properties,  (ii)  is  consistent  across  different  experimental  conditions (eyes-open  and  eyes-closed)  and  (iii)  its  identification  performance  outperforms  those  obtained  using  canonical spectral  features  as  band  specific  relative  power.  Overall,  the  best  performance  is  obtained  using  the  aperiodic  offset  in  the  eyes-closed  resting-state  condition. Nevertheless,  there  is  not  a  marked  difference  in  terms  of  performance  between  experimental  conditions (eyes-open  versus  eyes-closed  resting-state)  for  any  of  the  feature  vectors  tested.  In  line  with  previous  studies (Crobe  et  al.  2016;  M.  Fraschini  et  al.  2015) ,  for  the  periodic  component  we  observed  an  effect  on  the performance  due  to  the  high  frequency  content,  where  for  both  conditions  the  lowest  EER  values  (best performance)  were  obtained  for  beta  and  gamma  frequency  bands.  The  fact  that  the  aperiodic  component  of  the power  spectrum  outperforms  the  traditional  spectral  features  (i.e.,  band  specific  relative  power)  is  in  line  with the  hypothesis  that  the  a  priori  and  arbitrary  frequency  bands  definition  and  the  averaging  across  these  bands  can mitigate  individual  variability  (Haller  et  al.  2018) .  Furthermore,  these  results  also  support  the  hypothesis  that this  approach  may  help  to  better  understand  the  role  of  oscillatory  variability  in  explaining  individual differences  in  cognitive  functioning  in  health  and  disease  (Haller  et  al.  2018) .  Moreover,  the  aperiodic  component  has  been  linked  experimentally  to  neuronal  processes  at  micro-scale  level (Manning  et  al.  2009;  Miller  et  al.  2012;  Podvalny  et  al.  2015)  and  it  is  hypothesized  that  its  physiological meaning  might  reflect  the  dynamic  balance  between  excitation  and  inhibition  of  neural  population  (Gao  et  al. 2017) .  In  this  work  we  tried  to  make  a  bridge  testing  if  properties  reported  at  micro/meso  -scale  were  reliable  at macroscale  (i.e.  EEG  recordings).  Similarly  to  our  results,  recent  works  at  macroscale  level  showed  the reliability  of  individual  functional  brain  connectivity  profile  (Finn  et  al.  2015)  and  its  strong  genetic  dependence (Demuru  et  al.  2017) .  A  clear  limitation  of  the  present  study  is  that  it  is  based  on  a  single  session  scenario  and  it is  not  clear  how  these  findings  may  be  altered  using  different  EEG  recordings  in  a  multi-session  scenario. Nevertheless,  it  is  relevant  to  notice  that  our  work  is  especially  focused  on  relative  (and  not  absolute) performance,  since  we  present  the  results  as  a  strict  comparison  between  different  characteristics  of  the  EEG spectrum  (namely,  aperiodic  and  periodic  components).  Furthermore,  the  effects  induced  by  different  sessions on  subject  identification  in  EEG  have  been  widely  investigated  and  clarified  (Gui  et  al.  2019)  and  out  of  the scope  of  the  present  study. 7    Conclusions In  conclusion,  in  this  study  we  have  shown  that  an  EEG  individual’s  profile,  as  defined  by  the  aperiodic component  of  the  power  spectrum,  is  unique  and  it  is  possible  to  identify  individuals  (with  very  high  accuracy) from  a  large  EEG  dataset.  These  findings  suggest  that  these  simple  spectral  features  are  sensitive  to  individual traits  and  may  help  to  characterize  and  make  inferences  at  single  subject  level  using  EEG. 8     References Barra,  S.,  Casanova,  A.,  Fraschini,  M.,  &  Nappi,  M.
