We use the CHC operators to describe the theoremof deduction, the theorem of contradiction and the Lindenbaum theorem of classical logic, and clarify their existence in the CHCmodels; a number of examples is presented.

IntroductionTo some extent, the evolution of humankind and the progress of scientific research are the processes of makinghypotheses, posing conjectures and then verifying or refuting them, after which one may put forward other guessesand propose new conjectures to be proved or disproved [14,24,25,31].Roughly speaking, reasoning means that given some general knowledge together with some specific facts, certainconsequences are deduced. Logical reasoning is a central issue in mathematics and AI, so developing an appropriatereasoning method and setting up some appropriate reasoning models for conjectures, hypotheses, and consequences(abbr. CHCs) are both intriguing and significant.Recently, Trillas et al. [30] have established an interesting mathematical model for CHCs in orthocomplementedlattices. In their models (we call it the CHC models), the statements and propositions of human thinking are repre-sented as those elements in an orthocomplemented lattice; they then defined several meaningful operators (we call✩ This research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation (Nos. 90303024, 60573006), the Research Foundation for theDoctoral Program of Higher School of Ministry of Education (No. 20050558015), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(No. 031541) of China.E-mail address: issqdw@mail.sysu.edu.cn.0004-3702/$ – see front matter © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254them CHC operators), which act on each given set of premises, intuitively standing for the conjectures and hypothe-ses as well as the consequences of that set of premises. In addition, through studying such a model, they were ableto present a clear classification of conjectures [30], and verify two structure’s theorems of hypotheses, generalizingWatanabe’s structure theorem to the CHC models [31]. As is known, residuated lattices (see, for example, [1,2,6,7,10,13,15–17,19,22,23]) have close links with various important algebras (such as MV-algebras, Product algebras, andG¨odel algebras) and branches of logic such as probabilistic logic [28] and linear logic [12], and are used as a basis offuzzy logic [2,10,13,15–17,19,23]. Therefore, more recently, Ying and Wang [32] continued to investigate the CHCoperators in the framework of residuated lattices and orthocomplemented lattices.Orthocomplemented lattices are quite general algebraic structures, so, Trillas et al. [30] established a sufficientlyextensive reasoning model in which we can mathematically describe CHCs. We now state the results of this paperin detail. In Section 2, we first introduce the CHC operators and some related properties, and, we then present threeorthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattices such that the Watanabe’s structure theorem of hypotheses (whichwas established in the framework of Boolean algebras) is demonstrated as still valid in one of the three lattices, butinvalid in the others.Implication operators are one of the principal connectives in logical calculi; therefore, in Section 3, implicationoperators are brought into the CHC models. We are concerned with the study of combining implication operators withthese CHC operators in the framework of orthomodular lattices, and, using CHC operators to describe some general-ized forms of several important theorems of classical logic, as well as further clarifying their existence. However, allconditional connectives one can reasonably introduce in quantum logic (orthomodular lattices) are, to a certain extent,anomalous [5], for they do not share most of the characteristic properties that the “material implication” in classicallogic satisfies. A reasonably satisfactory implication is Sasaki hook, which contains some useful characteristics. Itshould be noticed that only in Boolean algebras it holds the equivalence between a ∧ z (cid:2) b and z (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ b. In properorthomodular lattices, a ∧ z (cid:2) b only has some maximal solutions, like Sasaki (a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b)) or Dishkant (b ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b(cid:3)))hooks. The problem in CHC models seems to be less that of having an “implication” (in fact, a Boolean concept) andthat of having a “conditional” →, i.e., an operation verifying the inequality a ∧ (a → b) (cid:2) b, Modus Ponens. At thisrespect, one of the important subjects lies in the “ordering” property: a (cid:2) b iff a → b = 1, verified by the Sasaki hookand Dishkant hook. Therefore, in this paper, Sasaki hook is mainly thought of as the implication operator in the CHCmodels.In Section 3, we first offer some fundamental properties of the implication operator in the CHC models. It is worthindicating that Pineda et al. [27] showed that, in the sense of the CHC models, the theorem of contradiction holds inBoolean algebras. Here we demonstrate that in any given orthocomplemented lattice L, if the theorem of contradictionholds, then L must be an orthomodular lattice. Notwithstanding, we also show that, in some orthomodular lattices,the theorem may prove invalid. Therefore, in the CHC models, orthomodular law is a necessary but not sufficientcondition for holding the theorem of contradiction.Subsequently, using such a model, we present a characterization of the theorem of deduction of classical logic;briefly, the generalized form of the deduction theorem holds if and only if the lattice L of the underlying logic isa Boolean algebra. This also clarifies in some sense the non-existence of the deduction theorem in quantum logic.Furthermore, we give an instance verifying that in some orthomodular lattices, a form of the Lindenbaum theoremdescribed by CHC operators does not hold, either, and we present a type of “weak Lindenbaum theorem” representedby these operators of CHCs.In Section 4, we first recall some fundamentals of residuated lattices, and then define the CHC operators inresiduated lattices. Particularly we concentrate on revealing some essential differences between CHCs in orthocom-plemented lattices and those in residuated lattices. In effect, we offer some characterizations between the propertiesof CHC operators and those of residuated lattices themselves, which show some of the essential characteristics ofCHC operators in residuated lattices. We discover that, in residuated lattices, the theorem of contradiction holds iffthe residuated lattices satisfy the double negation (x = x(cid:3)(cid:3)), weaker condition than Boolean algebras, since from [17]we know that a residuated lattice satisfying both the double negation and x ∧ x(cid:3) = 0 reduces to a Boolean algebra.Still, we prove that Watanabe’s structure theorem of hypotheses in the setting of MV-algebras (therefore, residuatedlattices) does not hold, either. Finally, in Section 5, the main results of the paper are summarized, and some relatedissues are addressed.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254241In the interest of readability, we will make this paper sufficiently self-contained. To this end, we introduce relatednotions and notation in Section 2. On the other hand, to make the supremum and the infimum of P valid (P ⊆ L), thelattices L considered in this paper are complete.2. Watanabe’s structure theorem of hypotheses in the CHC modelsFirst let us recall the definitions of orthocomplemented lattices and orthomodular lattices. An orthocomplementedlattice is an algebraic structure (cid:7)L, (cid:2), (cid:3), 0, 1(cid:8) where(1) (cid:7)L, (cid:2), 0, 1(cid:8) is a bounded lattice with the least element 0 and the greatest element 1. In other words, (i) (cid:2) is apartial order relation on L (i.e. reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive); and (ii) any pair of elements a, b has aninfimum a ∧ b and a supremum a ∨ b (i.e. for any c, a ∧ b (cid:2) a, b, and if c (cid:2) a, b then c (cid:2) a ∧ b; a, b (cid:2) a ∨ b,and if a, b (cid:2) c then a ∨ b (cid:2) c).(2) The unary operation (cid:3) : L → L called orthocomplement satisfies the following conditions:(i) a ∧ a(cid:3) = 0 for any a ∈ L.(ii) a = a(cid:3)(cid:3) for any a ∈ L.(iii) a (cid:2) b implies b(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) for any a, b ∈ L.From conditions (ii) and (iii) it follows readily that for any a, b ∈ L,(a ∧ b)(cid:3) = a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3),(a ∨ b)(cid:3) = a(cid:3) ∧ b(cid:3).For the sake of completeness, we verify the first one, and the second is similar. Due to a ∧ b (cid:2) a and a ∧ b (cid:2) b, with(iii) we have a(cid:3) (cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3) and b(cid:3) (cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3). Thus, a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3) (cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3). Contrarily, since a(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3) and b(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3),we have (a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3))(cid:3) (cid:2) a and (a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3))(cid:3) (cid:2) b. Therefore, (a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3))(cid:3) (cid:2) a ∧ b, which, together with (iii) and (ii), results in(a ∧ b)(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ b(cid:3).An orthomodular lattice is an orthocomplemented lattice satisfying the following condition (3):(3) For any a, b ∈ L, if a (cid:2) b, then b = a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b).By using the above condition (2), condition (3) can be equivalently stated as:(3(cid:3)) For any a, b ∈ L, if a (cid:2) b, then a = b ∧ (b(cid:3) ∨ a).It is clear that orthomodularity represents a weak form of distributivity. Of course, distributivity implies ortho-modularity but, actually, what orthomodular law states is the existence, when a (cid:2) b, of the relative complementb − a = a(cid:3) ∧ b, giving a(cid:3) if b = 1. This existence allows, for example, the verification of the important property“a (cid:2) b ⇒ prob(a) (cid:2) prob(b)” for probabilities in orthomodular lattices and, of course, in Boolean algebras.Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice, and for any P ⊆ L,P andP stand for the supremum and the infimum(cid:2)(cid:3)of P , respectively. DenoteP0(L) =(cid:4)P ⊆ L:(cid:5)(cid:6)P (cid:11)= 0⊆ P(L);L0 = L − {0} ⊆ L,where P(L) denotes the power set of L, and for any P ∈ P0(L), P represents a set of some noncontradictory premises,that is, for any pi, pj ∈ P , pi (cid:11)(cid:2) p(cid:3)j . Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira [30] defined several interesting operators Φ∨, Φ∧,C∨, C∧, and H∧ together with their intuitive implications as follows:Φ∨(P ) =Φ∧(P ) =C∨(P ) =C∧(P ) =H∧(P ) =(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L0: q (cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:6)P (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3)(cid:3)P (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:6)P (cid:2) q(cid:6)(cid:6)P (cid:2) q(cid:5)(conjectures of P ),(cid:6)(strict conjectures of P ),(loose consequences of P ),(consequences of P ),P(hypotheses of P ).242D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254Moreover, the following derived operators were given.(cid:7)(cid:6)P(cid:7)(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:2)(restricted consequences of P ),(cid:6)P(strict and restricted conjectures of P ),(cid:3), qP (cid:2) q (cid:2)C(P ) =Φ(P ) =(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L:P (cid:11)(cid:2) q∗∨(P ) = Φ∨(P ) − Φ∧(P )∗∧(P ) = Φ∧(P ) −∗∧(P ) = H∧(P ) −(cid:4)q ∈ L0: q (cid:2)P(cid:7)H∨(P ) =ΦΦH(cid:6),(cid:6)(loose conjectures of P ),(cid:9)(cid:8)C∧(P ) ∪ H∧(P )(cid:4)(cid:5)(proper conjectures of P ),P(we call it loose hypotheses of P ).(cid:3)Denote L01 = L − {0, 1}; pN Cq represents that p is incomparable with q, i.e., p (cid:11)(cid:2) q and q (cid:11)(cid:2) p. For anyP ∈ P0(L), set A∧(P ) = {a ∈ L0: (P ) (cid:11)= 0}.Obviously, A∧(P ) ⊆ B∧(P ). Trillas, Cubillo, and Castiñeira [30] showed that (i) if L is an orthocomplemented lattice,then for P ∈ P0(L),(cid:10)(cid:5)∗∧(P ) =P ) (cid:11)= 0} and B∧(P ) = {a ∈ L01:(cid:6): q ∈ B∧(P )P )NCa, a ∧ (P (cid:11)(cid:2) a, a ∧ (∧ B∧(P )(cid:10)(cid:5)q ∧(1)·=(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)HPP(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:11);(ii) if L is an orthomodular lattice, then for P ∈ P0(L) and(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)∗∧(P ) =HP∧ A∧(P )(cid:4)q ∧·=(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)P(cid:3)P (cid:11)= 1,(cid:6): q ∈ A∧(P ),(2)(cid:3)which generalize the Watanabe’s structure theorem of hypotheses in the case of Boolean algebras [31].P (cid:11)= 1 cannot be ignored; otherwise, Eq. (2) may not hold,(cid:3)It is worth pointing out that in Eq. (2), the conditionP = 1 implies both A∧(P ) = ∅ and H ∗∧(P ) = L01.(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)P ) ∧ A∧(P ) ⊆ (Clearly, (P ) ∧ B∧(P ) ⊆ ((cid:3)sinceP ) ∧ B∧(P ) always holds. On the other hand, the orthomodular condition entails(cid:3)P ) ∧ A∧(P ). Nevertheless, when L is only required to be an orthocomplemented lattice, we will(construct one example of orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattice depicted in Fig. 2 (Example 3), in whichH ∗P (cid:11)= 1. A natural question to raise is whether the orthomodularlaw is necessary to guarantee H ∗P ) ∧ A∧(P )? Here we also present an example (Example 1) to verify thatH ∗P ) ∧ A∧(P ) may be still valid in some orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattices. Therefore,such a question can be answered negatively.P ) ∧ A∧(P ) for some P ∈ P0(L) with∧(P ) = (∧(P ) (cid:11)= (∧(P ) = ((cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Example 1. There exists an orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattice L such that in this lattice, for anyP ∈ P0(L) with∗∧(P ) =(cid:6): q ∈ A∧(P )P (cid:11)= 1, then(cid:11)(cid:4)q ∧∧ A∧(P )(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:5)·=HPP(cid:11).Proof. Let orthocomplemented lattice L = {a, b, c, d, e, a(cid:3), b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3), e(cid:3), 0, 1} be visualized in Fig. 1.Fig. 1.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254243It is direct to check that the above defined L is an orthocomplemented lattice, but it is not orthomodular, becausein this lattice, a (cid:2) b but b (cid:11)= a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b) = a which violates the orthomodular condition. Furthermore, we can verifythat for any P ∈ P0(L), it holds that(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)∗∧(P ) =HP∧ A∧(P ).More specially, it suffices to consider the cases of P ∈ {{d}, {c}, {b}, {a(cid:3)}, {e}}, because when(cid:3)P ∈ {e(cid:3), a, b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3)},A∧(P ) = H∗∧(P ) = ∅.Now, we have(cid:9)(cid:8){d}(cid:9)(cid:8){b}(cid:9)(cid:8){e}(cid:8){c}(cid:8)(cid:3)}{a(cid:9)A∧A∧HA∧∗∧∗∧H= {c, b};= {d, e};(cid:3)};= {b, a(cid:3)};(cid:3)= {e(cid:9)(cid:3)};= {b, b(cid:3), dA∧A∧∗∧∗∧HH(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:3)};(cid:8){c}(cid:8)(cid:3)}{a(cid:8){d}(cid:8){b}(cid:8){e}= {d, a(cid:9)= {c, e};(cid:3)};= {a, e(cid:3)};= {a, c(cid:9)(cid:3)= {c, d(cid:9)∗∧H(cid:3)};(cid:9)(cid:9);and it is easy to check that(cid:8)(cid:8)∗d ∧ A∧{d}= H{d}∧(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:8)∗;{c}= H{c}c ∧ A∧∧(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:8)∗;{c}= H{b}b ∧ A∧∧(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:3) ∧ A∧(cid:3)}∗(cid:3)}{a{a= Ha∧(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:8)∗{e}{e}= He ∧ A∧.∧(cid:9)(cid:9);and(cid:2)Moreover, we can characterize H ∗∨(P ) = {q ∈ L0: q (cid:2)hypotheses of P . The main results are as follows:(cid:2)(cid:2)P } − {P }, which may be called the proper looseTheorem 2.1. (1) Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. Then for P ∈ P0(L),∗∨(P ) =H(cid:4)q ∧(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:6): q ∈ B∨(P )P(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)P∧ B∨(P ),(cid:2)·=(cid:2)where B∨(P ) = {q ∈ L01: (P ) (cid:11)(cid:2) q, q ∧ (P ) (cid:11)= 0}.(2) If L is an orthomodular lattice, then for P ∈ P0(L),(cid:2)P (cid:11)= 1,(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)∗∨(P ) =HP∧ A∨(P ),(cid:2)where A∨(P ) = {q ∈ L01: ((cid:2)P )NCq, q ∧ ((cid:2)P ) (cid:11)= 0}.(cid:2)(cid:2)Proof. (1) If q ∈ H ∗(cid:2)(∨(P ), then q = (q ∧ ((cid:2)P )) ∧ (P ) ∧ B∨(P ) ⊆ H ∗P ) and q ∧ (∨(P ) is clear.P ) ∧ B∨(P ). On the other hand, ((2) First it is clear that ((cid:2)P }, and thus q = q ∧ ((cid:2)(cid:2)P ) ∧ A∨(P ) ⊆ H ∗P and q /∈P ). We recall that the orthomodular condition says: for any a, b ∈ L, if a (cid:2) b, then{0,b = a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b). Therefore, for any a, b ∈ L, if a (cid:2) b, then b(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) and, thus, with orthomodular condition we have(cid:2)a(cid:3) = b(cid:3) ∨ (b ∧ a(cid:3)), i.e., a = b ∧ (b(cid:3) ∨ a). Here, since q ∧ (P , in terms of the orthomodular condition justgiven we get∨(P ). On the other hand, if q ∈ H ∗∨(P ), then q (cid:2)P ) (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)P ) ∈ B∨(P ), which shows that H ∗∨(P ) ⊆(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)q ∧P=P∧∨q ∧P(cid:2)from which, together with q = q ∧ ((cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:11)q = q ∧P=P∧(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:7)P ) we have(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:3)q ∧∨PP,(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11).P244D.

This completes the proofP , and consequently,(cid:2)(cid:2)P ))) = (P ), and thus(cid:2)(cid:2)P )(cid:3) ∨ (q ∧ (P )(cid:3) ∨ (q ∧ (∨(P ). Therefore, it holds that (Noticeably, the above method of proof is different from [30] by Trillas et al. and applies to their proof. As above,we naturally ask whether L being orthomodular lattice is necessary for preserving part (2) in Theorem 1. Indeed,the answer is negative, and we can verify that the orthocomplemented, but not orthomodular lattice presented inExample 1 validates this view. We further formulate it by Example 2 as follows.Example 2. There exists an orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattice L such that in this lattice, for anyP ∈ P0(L) with(cid:2)P (cid:11)= 1, then(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:7)∗∨(P ) =HP∧ A∨(P ).Proof. Let L be the orthocomplemented lattice from Example 1. That is, L = {a, b, c, d, e, a(cid:3), b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3), e(cid:3), 0, 1} isdepicted by Fig. 1. The remainder of the verification is also similar to Example 1, but in the interest of completeness,we briefly check it here. For any given P ∈ P0(L) withP (cid:11)= 1, we consider it by the following two scenarios:(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)• If• If(iv)(cid:2)P ∈ {e(cid:3), a, b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3)}, then A∨(P ) = H ∗P ∈ {d, c, b, a(cid:3), e}, then we further divide it into five cases: (i)(cid:2)P = d, then P ∈ {{d}, {d, e(cid:3)}, {d, a}}. In any case of P , we have A∨(P ) = {c, b}, H ∗P = b;P = e. We only check the first case, since the others are completely analogous. If∨(P ) = {e(cid:3), a}, and there-∨(P ) = ∅, and hence H ∗P = a(cid:3); (v)(cid:2)P ) ∧ A∨(P ).P = c; (iii)P = d; (ii)∨(P ) = ((cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)fore, (P ) ∧ A∨(P ) = {e(cid:3), a} = H ∗∨(P ).(cid:2)So far we have completed the proof. (cid:2)The further question raised naturally is whether there are some orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattices(cid:2)P ) ∧ A∨(P ) holds for some appropriate P . The answerP ) ∧ A∧(P ) nor H ∗∨(P ) = ((cid:3)such that neither H ∗is positive from the following example.∧(P ) = (Example 3. There exist orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattices L such that there are P ∈ P0(L) with(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)P (cid:11)= 1, satisfying both H ∗∧(P ) (cid:11)= (P ) ∧ A∧(P ) and H ∗∨(P ) (cid:11)= (P ) ∧ A∨(P ).P (cid:11)= 1 andFig. 2.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254245Proof. We present one example here. Let lattice L = {a, b, c, d, a(cid:3), b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3), 1, 0} be visualized in Fig. 2. Then it isstraightforward to check that L constructed is an orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattice. Firstly, it satisfiesthe conditions of orthocomplemented lattices defined above. Secondly, it does not satisfy orthomodular law, because,b (cid:2) d, but d (cid:11)= b ∨ (b(cid:3) ∧ d) = b. Thirdly, if we take P = {a}, then H ∗∨(P ) = {d, b, c}, and A∧(P ) =A∨(P ) = {b(cid:3), c(cid:3), d (cid:3)}. Therefore, we have both H ∗P ) ∧∨(P ) (cid:11)= {c, d} = (A∨(P ). (cid:2)∧(P ) = H ∗P ) ∧ A∧(P ) and H ∗∧(P ) (cid:11)= {c, d} = ((cid:2)(cid:3)3. A number of logic theorems in the CHC modelsQuantum logic is usually defined as orthomodular lattices [26], in which one of the most important issues is thepossibility of defining reasonable implication connectives. Indeed, it has been verified [18] that there are exactly fivedefinitions of implications → that satisfy the primitive implication condition:a (cid:2) bif and only ifa → b = 1.We might point out here that in classical logic (Boolean), these five implication operators are equivalent to “materialimplication” denoted by →0, defined as a →0 b = a(cid:3) ∨ b.Among these comparatively reasonable five implications, Sasaki hook →Q defined as a →Q b = a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b) isthe unique one satisfying condition [11,29]: There exists a binary operation defined as a & b = b ∧ (a ∨ b(cid:3)) such thatfor any a, b, c ∈ L, a & b (cid:2) c if and only if a (cid:2) b →Q c, which is similar to the form of deduction theorem of the first-order logic. The following proposition not only shows that Sasaki hook has an intrinsic connection with orthomodularcondition, but is also useful for our discussion.Proposition 3.1. (Mittelstaedt [21]) Let L = (cid:7)L, (cid:2), (cid:3), 0, 1(cid:8) be an orthocomplemented lattice.(1) L is orthomodular iff there exists binary operation S(a, b) such that the following conditions are satisfied.(i) a ∧ S(a, b) (cid:2) b;(ii) a ∧ c (cid:2) b implies a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ c) (cid:2) S(a, b).The operation S(a, b) satisfying the above conditions is unique, namely, S(a, b) = a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b) is exactlySasaki hook.(2) L is a Boolean algebra iff the above conditions are satisfied by material implication, i.e., S(a, b) = a →0 b =a(cid:3) ∨ b.Therefore, we choose Sasaki hook →Q as our implication connective, simply denoted by →. First we consider theconnections of the implication operator to conjecture operators.Proposition 3.2. Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. If P ∈ P0(L), then:(1) If a ∈ C∧(P ) and a → b ∈ Φ∧(P ), then {a, b, a ∧ b} ⊆ Φ∧(P ).(2) If a ∧ b ∈ Φ∧(P ), then a → b ∈ Φ∧(P ).(cid:3)Proof. (1) If a ∈ C∧(P ) and a → b ∈ Φ∧(P ), thenthena ∧ b (cid:2) b, it follows that a, b ∈ Φ∧(P ).P (cid:2) a ∧ (a ∧ b)(cid:3), which is contradictory. So,(cid:3)(2) If a ∧ b ∈ Φ∧(P ) and a → b (cid:11)∈ Φ∧(P ), thenP (cid:2) a and(cid:3)P (cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3),P (cid:11)(cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3), i.e., a ∧ b ∈ Φ∧(P ). Since a ∧ b (cid:2) a, andP (cid:11)(cid:2) (a → b)(cid:3) = a ∧ (a ∧ b)(cid:3). IfP (cid:11)(cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3) and(cid:3)P (cid:2) a ∧ (a ∧ b)(cid:3) (cid:2) (a ∧ b)(cid:3), which is(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)absurd. Therefore, (2) holds, and the proposition is proved. (cid:2)Proposition 3.3. Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. If P ∈ P0(L), then:(1) If a ∈ C∨(P ) and a → b ∈ Φ∨(P ), then {a, b, a ∧ b} ⊆ Φ∨(P ).(2) If a ∧ b ∈ Φ∨(P ), then a → b ∈ Φ∨(P ).Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.2. (cid:2)246D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254Implication operator is also closely related to consequence operators.Proposition 3.4. Let P ∈ P0(L). Then:(1) If L is an orthocomplemented lattice, then b ∈ C∨(P ∪ {a}) if and only if b ∈ C∨(P ) and a (cid:2) b.(2) If L is an orthomodular lattice, then:(i) If a → b ∈ C∧(P ), then a ∧ b and b ∈ C∧(P ∪ {a}).(ii) (P ) & a (cid:2) b iff a → b ∈ C∧(P ), where a & b = b ∧ (a ∨ b(cid:3)), as indicated above.(cid:3)P (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b). With orthomodular law,P ) ∧ a (cid:2) a ∧ (a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b)) = a ∧ b and thus a ∧ b ∈ C∧(P ∪ {a}). Also, b ∈ C∧(P ∪ {a}), since a ∧ b (cid:2) b. (ii) ItProof. The proof of (1) is immediate. (2) (i) If a → b ∈ C∧(P ), then(cid:3)(follows from (P (cid:2) a → b [11,29]. Therefore (ii) holds, and the proof is completed. (cid:2)P ) & a (cid:2) b iff(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)With the consequence operator C∧, the theorem of contradiction of classical logic may be reformulated in the CHCmodel as follows: For an orthocomplemented lattice L, and P ∈ P0(L),(C) ∀a ∈ L: a ∈ C∧(P ) ⇐⇒ a(cid:3) ∧P= 0.(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)Now we may naturally ask whether it holds in orthologic and quantum logic, i.e., when L is an orthocomplementedor orthomodular lattice. Firstly, we verify that, in any given orthocomplemented lattice L, the theorem of contradictionholding implies that L must be orthomodular.Theorem 3.5. Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. If the theorem of contradiction expressed by (C) in L holds,then L must be an orthomodular lattice.Proof. We prove by contradiction. Assume that L is not orthomodular. Then with the orthomodular condition thereexist a, b ∈ L such that a (cid:2) b but b (cid:11)= a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b), that is, a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b) < b since a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b) (cid:2) b holds by a (cid:2) b,where, here and in the paper, “e1 < e2” means that e1 (cid:2) e2 but e1 (cid:11)= e2. In addition, we note b ∈ L01, i.e., b (cid:11)= 0, 1;otherwise, a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b) = b. Set x = a ∨ (a(cid:3) ∧ b). Then x < b and(cid:3)= (b ∧ a(cid:9)(cid:3) = b ∧(cid:8)a ∨ (a(cid:3) = b ∧(cid:3)(cid:3) ∧ b)(cid:3) ∧ b)(cid:3) ∧ b)(cid:3) ∧ (a) ∧ (a(cid:3) = 0,b ∧ x(cid:8)a(cid:9)from which, together with the theorem of contradiction described by condition (C) (by taking P = {b}), we obtainb (cid:2) x, that is also contradiction with x < b given above. Therefore L must be an orthomodular lattice. (cid:2)A direct corollary from Theorem 3.5 is as follows.Corollary 3.6. Let L be an orthocomplemented but not orthomodular lattice. Then the theorem of contradictionexpressed by (C) in L does not hold.Naturally we may ask whether L being orthomodular infers that the theorem of contradiction holds. Indeed, thisimplication may be not true by the following example, i.e., we present an orthomodular lattice (Fig. 3), such that theabove theorem of contradiction may not hold.Fig. 3.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254247Example 4. There is an orthomodular lattice such that the theorem of contradiction expressed by (C) does not hold.Proof. Let orthomodular lattice L = {a, b, a(cid:3), b(cid:3), 1, 0} be of a “Chinese lantern” form drawn in Fig. 3. Then it is clearthat a(cid:3) ∧ b = 0 but a (cid:11)(cid:2) b. That is, both a /∈ C∧({b}) and a(cid:3) ∧ b = 0 hold, which invalidates (C) in this lattice. (cid:2)Remark. From Theorem 3.5 and Example 4 we have seen that orthomodularity is only a necessary but not sufficientcondition for holding the theorem of contradiction. However, in Boolean algebras, Pineda et al. [27] proved thefollowing result.Theorem 3.7. [27] If L is a complete Boolean algebra, then the theorem of contradiction expressed by (C) holds.Next we deal with the theorem of deduction in the CHC models, which may be represented as follows: For ortho-complemented lattice L, and for any P ∈ P0(L) and any a, b ∈ L,b ∈ C∧(cid:8)P ∪ {a}(cid:9)iffa → b ∈ C∧(P ).(3)Indeed, from the following theorem it follows that the theorem of deduction in the CHC model may not hold.Theorem 3.8. Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. Then the following statements are equivalent.(1) L is a Boolean algebra.(2) For any P ∈ P0(L) and any a, b ∈ L: b ∈ C∧(P ∪ {a}) iff a → b ∈ C∧(P ).Proof. (1) inferring (2) is direct. With regard to (2) deducing (1), by means of Proposition 3.1(2) it suffices to showthat for any a, b ∈ L, a ∧ (a(cid:3) ∨ b) (cid:2) b. If either a or b is 0, it clearly holds. In general, we utilize the condition (2)repeatedly. Since a ∧ b (cid:2) b, by the condition (2) we have b (cid:2) a → b. Moreover, due to a(cid:3) (cid:2) a(cid:3) ∨ (a ∧ b) = a → b,we obtain a(cid:3) ∨ b (cid:2) a → b. Again, by means of the condition (2), it follows that a ∧ (a(cid:3) ∨ b) (cid:2) b. (cid:2)Another important negative result in quantum logic is that the “Lindenbaum theorem” does not hold, which wasverified by Dalla Chiara [4]. According to Lindenbaum theorem of classical logic, any noncontradictory set X of sen-tences can be extended to a complete set (a complete set is a noncontradictory set satisfying that for any sentences α,either α or the negation of α is one of its consequences). In the CHC models, Lindenbaum theorem may be expressedas:Let L be an orthocomplemented lattice. For any P ∈ P0(L), there is Q ∈ P0(L) such that P ⊆ Q and for anyq ∈ L, either q ∈ C∧(Q) or q(cid:3) ∈ C∧(Q).Here, by means of an orthomodular lattice (Greechie lattice G12) represented in Fig. 4, we can demonstrate thatthis theorem in this orthomodular lattice does not hold.Fig. 4.248D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254Q ∈(cid:3)In such a lattice, set P = {a} for example. Then for any Q ⊆ L, with P ⊆ Q and(cid:3)(cid:12){a}, {a, 1}, {a, bQ = a, so it follows that neither d nor d (cid:3) belongs to C∧(Q); and neither e nor e(cid:3) belongs to C∧(Q), either.and thusAs a result, it invalidates the Lindenbaum theorem in this lattice. That is to say, Lindenbaum theorem may not hold inquantum logic.Q (cid:11)= 0, it entails that, 1}, {a, b, 1}, {a, c(cid:3)}, {a, b(cid:3)}, {a, b(cid:3)}, {a, c, 1}(cid:13),, c, c(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Indeed, in orthomodular lattice L (“Chinese lantern”) depicted in Fig. 3, the above theorem does not hold, either.Q (cid:11)= 0, it entails that Q ∈ {{a}, {a, 1}}. However,Take P = {a} for example. Then for any Q ⊆ L, with P ⊆ Q andneither b nor b(cid:3) belongs to C∧(Q).(cid:3)Notwithstanding this, we may offer a kind of “weak Lindenbaum theorem”. First, we define the compatibilitybetween two sets.Definition 3.1. Let P1,P2 ∈ P0(L). P1 is called compatible with P2, denoted by P1CP2, if and only if for each q ∈ Lsuch that ifP1 (cid:2) q, thenP2 (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3).(cid:3)(cid:3)Remark. Clearly, (1) if P1 ∪ P2 ∈ P0(L), then P1CP2; and (2) P1CP2 implies P2CP1 and vice versa.Proposition 3.9. Let P1,P2 ∈ P0(L).(cid:3)(cid:3)(i) If bothP1 andP2 are atomic, and P1CP2, then Φ∧(P1) = Φ∧(P2), where an element p is called atomic iffor any q ∈ L, either p (cid:2) q or p (cid:2) q(cid:3) holds.(ii) If either Φ∧(P1) ⊆ Φ∧(P2) or Φ∧(P2) ⊆ Φ∧(P1), then P1CP2.(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Proof. (i) Suppose q ∈ Φ∧(P1), then(cid:3)P1 (cid:2) q. With P1CP2, we haveP2 (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3), i.e., q ∈ Φ∧(P2). Therefore Φ∧(P1) ⊆ Φ∧(P2). On the other hand, Φ∧(P2) ⊆ Φ∧(P1) can be similarlyP1 is atomic, it holds thatP1 (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3). Sinceverified.(ii) Let Φ∧(P1) ⊆ Φ∧(P2). IfP1 (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3) since P1 ∈ P0(L). This verifies P2CP1.If Φ∧(P2) ⊆ Φ∧(P1), then we can analogously show that P2CP1 and thus P1CP2. This proof is completed. (cid:2)P1 (cid:2) q, and thusP2 (cid:2) q, then(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Now we present the so-called “weak Lindenbaum theorem”.Theorem 3.10. Let P ∈ P0(L). If q ∈ Φ∧(P ), then there is Q ∈ P0(L), such that QCP and q ∈ C∧(Q).Proof. Take Q = {q}. First, clearly Q ∈ P0(L) and q ∈ C∧(Q), sinceholds; otherwise,pleted. (cid:2)P (cid:11)(cid:2) r (cid:3)P (cid:2) r (cid:3) (cid:2) q(cid:3), which contradicts q ∈ Φ∧(P ). Therefore, QCP holds and the proof is com-Q = q ∈ Φ∧(P ). If q (cid:2) r, then(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)4. The CHCs in residuated latticesResiduated lattices were introduced in 1924 [20] and further investigated in the late 1930s by algebraists [6,7],but the study has been revived recently as a study of algebraic structures for fuzzy logics and other non-classicallogics (for example, see [10,13,15,17,19,22,23] and the references therein). A residuated lattice is an algebra L =(cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8), satisfying:(i) (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, 0, 1(cid:8) is a bounded lattice with the least element 0 and the greatest element 1;(ii) (cid:7)L, ⊗, 1(cid:8) is a commutative monoid, that is, ⊗ is a commutative and associative operation with the identitya ⊗ 1 = a;(iii) (cid:7)⊗, →(cid:8) satisfies: for all a, b, c ∈ L, a ⊗ b (cid:2) c if and only if a (cid:2) b → c.From axioms (i), (ii), (iii) it readily follows that ⊗ is isotone in both arguments, and → is antitone in the first andisotone in the second variable.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254249We briefly recall other algebras closely related to residuated lattices. For the details, we refer to, for example, [1,2,10,13,15,17–19,22] and the references therein. A special residuated lattice is the Boolean algebra for classical logic;other typical examples of residuated lattices include the real unit interval [0,1] equipped with the most importantthree continuous t-norms on [0,1]: Lukasiewicz t-norm, Product t-norm, Gödel t-norm. The three t-norms and theirassociated residua correspond to the most significant fuzzy logics: Lukasiewicz logic, Product logic, and Gödel logic,respectively. The MV-algebras, the Product algebras, and the Gödel algebras constitute the algebraic models for thesethree types of logics, respectively. The class of BL-algebras contains the MV-algebras, the Product algebras, and theGödel algebras (Gödel algebra = linear Heyting algebras = L-algebras).In the interest of readability, we further review the relationships between residuated lattices and other importantalgebras. For residuated lattice L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8), L satisfies the prelinearity axiom [13,15], i.e. L is an MTLalgebra [9], if and only if for all a, b ∈ L, (a → b) ∨ (b → a) = 1 holds; L is called divisible [15] iff for all a, b ∈ L,a ∧ b = a ⊗ (a → b). L satisfies the Double Negation [15] iff for any a ∈ L, a = (a → 0) → 0 holds, where, here andin the sequel, we denote a(cid:3) = a → 0, and thus, a(cid:3)(cid:3) = (a → 0) → 0. If for any a, b ∈ L, a ⊗ b = a ∧ b, then L reducesto a Heyting algebra [1]; if L is divisible and satisfies the prelinearity axiom, then L is a BL-algebra [13,16]; if Lis a BL-algebra and satisfies the double negation, then L is an MV-algebra [2,13,15,16]. A product algebra [13,16]is a BL-algebra, satisfying that for all elements a, b, c in the lattice, both c(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:2) ((a ⊗ c) → (b ⊗ c)) → (a → b) anda ∧ a(cid:3) = 0 hold. A Gödel algebra [13,16] is a BL-algebra that satisfies a ⊗ a = a for each a in the lattice. Finally, aBoolean algebra is a residuated lattice that is both a Heyting algebra and an MV-algebra.In addition, it is worth pointing out that, if the residuated lattice L satisfies the law of double negation and thecondition: a ∧ a(cid:3) = 0 for all a ∈ L, then L is a Boolean algebra (see [17], Proposition 2.35).Now we set out dealing with the CHC models in residuated lattices. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a completeresiduated lattice. DenoteL(0) = {q ∈ L: q (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3)} = {q ∈ L: q ⊗ q (cid:11)= 0} ⊆ L(cid:6)P0(L) =(cid:4)P ⊆ L:(cid:3)whose elements are not self-contradictory, where q(cid:3) = q → 0. Obviously, q1 ∈ L(0) together with q1 (cid:2) q2 impliesq2 ∈ L(0). Define the family of all sets of premises:(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:5)P ⊆ L:(cid:3)P ), we have P0(L) ⊆ P0(L), but they may be unequal. Now, for anyTherefore, with ((cid:3)P ∈ P0(L) and any pi, pj ∈ P , since (P ) (cid:2) pi ⊗ pj , we have pi ⊗ pj (cid:11)= 0; equivalently, pi (cid:11)(cid:2) pj → 0,(cid:3)i.e., pi (cid:11)(cid:2) p(cid:3)j for any pi, pj ∈ P . This is why we define P0(L) as the family ofsets of premises. As we know, the elements of CHCs are not self-contradictory, and therefore, the CHC operators maybe suitably defined as follows. For any P ∈ P0(L),P ) ⊗ (P (cid:11)= 0 cannot derive pi (cid:11)(cid:2) p(cid:3)P ∈ L(0)(cid:3)⊆ P(L).P ) ∧ ((cid:3)P ) (cid:2) (P ) ⊗ (j . But(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)= 0(cid:3)⊗=PP(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:6),,(cid:3)(cid:3)Φ∨(P ) =Φ∧(P ) =C∨(P ) =C∧(P ) =H∧(P ) =(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)q ∈ L(0):(cid:4)q ∈ L(0):(cid:7)(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L(0): q (cid:2)(cid:5)P (cid:11)(cid:2) qP (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:6),(cid:6),P (cid:2) qP (cid:2) q(cid:5)(cid:6)P.It is worth remarking that the restriction of q ∈ L(0) in the above definitions of Φ∨(P ), Φ∧(P ) and H∧(P ) is needed,because neitherP can derive q ∈ L(0). On the other hand, it is easy to show thatP (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3) nor q (cid:2)P (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3),(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2)C∨(P ) ⊆ C∧(P ) ⊆ L(0),by using P ∈ P0(L) and (P ) ⊗ (P ) (cid:2) (P ) ⊗ (P ).Because for any p, q and r ∈ L, p (cid:2) q → r iff p ⊗ q (cid:2) r, we have(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)Φ∨(P ) =Φ∧(P ) =(cid:4)q ∈ L(0):(cid:4)q ∈ L(0):(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)PP⊗ q (cid:11)= 0⊗ q (cid:11)= 0(cid:6),(cid:6).250D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254The operators of CHCs in residuated lattices include most of those basic properties present in the framework oforthocomplemented lattices, but there are some essential differences. As we know, orthocomplemented lattices satisfyorthocomplemented law (i.e., x = x(cid:3)(cid:3) and x ∧ x(cid:3) = 0), whereas residuated lattices may not satisfy the Double Negation(i.e., x(cid:3)(cid:3) = x, where x(cid:3) = x → 0). On the other hand, though orthocomplemented lattices and residuated lattices maynot satisfy distributive law, in residuated lattices, there exist properties: a ⊗ (i xi) → a =(cid:3)i xi exist. Therefore they may render some intrinsici xi anddistinctions between the CHCs in these lattices. First we describe some of the intrinsic attributes of the CHC operatorsin residuated lattices. As mentioned above, if L is a complete Boolean algebra, theni(xi → a), and a → (i(a → xi), ifi(a ⊗ xi), (i xi) =i xi) =(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)∀a ∈ L: a ∈ C∧(P ) ⇐⇒ a(cid:3) ∧P= 0.(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)However, this result may not hold in the framework of residuated lattices. We offer the following proposition.Proposition 4.1. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete residuated lattice. Then the following two statementsare equivalent.(1) For any q ∈ L, q = q(cid:3)(cid:3).(2) For any P ∈ P(L) and any q ∈ L, q ∈ C∧(P ) iff q(cid:3) ⊗ ((cid:3)P ) = 0.Proof. Firstly we know q (cid:2) q(cid:3)(cid:3) and q ⊗ q(cid:3) = q(cid:3) ⊗ q = 0 for all q ∈ L. (1) ⇒ (2) is clear, since (2) can be equivalentlyP (cid:2) (q(cid:3) → 0) = q(cid:3)(cid:3). (2) ⇒ (1): For any q ∈ L, bydescribed as: for any P ∈ P(L) and any q ∈ L,P (cid:2) q ifftaking P = {q(cid:3)(cid:3)}, then, q(cid:3) ⊗ (P ) = 0 and, in terms of (2) we have q(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:2) q, which, together with q (cid:2) q(cid:3)(cid:3), results inq = q(cid:3)(cid:3), i.e., (1) holds. (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Since L(0) ⊆ L and P0 ⊆ P(L), we have the following corollary.Corollary 4.2. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete residuated lattice. Then the following two statements areequivalent.(1) For any q ∈ L(0), q = q(cid:3)(cid:3).(2) For any P ∈ P0(L) and any q ∈ L(0), q ∈ C∧(P ) iff q(cid:3) ⊗ ((cid:3)P ) = 0.Proof. The details are similar to Proposition 4.1, but for completeness, we still give the procedure. (1) ⇒ (2): This iseasy to prove. (2) ⇒ (1): Since for any q ∈ L, q ⊗ (q → 0) (cid:2) 0; equivalently, q (cid:2) q(cid:3)(cid:3), we have that q ∈ L(0) implies(cid:3)q(cid:3)(cid:3) ∈ L(0). Note that if for any P ∈ P0(L),P (cid:2) q2 where q1, q2 ∈ L(0), then q1 = q2. As we know, (2)P (cid:2) (q(cid:3) → 0) for any P ∈ P0(L) and any q ∈ L(0), which results incan be equivalently expressed as:q = (q(cid:3) → 0) = q(cid:3)(cid:3) for any q ∈ L(0). Therefore, this proof is completed. (cid:2)P (cid:2) q1 iff(cid:3)P (cid:2) q iff(cid:3)(cid:3)Corollary 4.2 gives, in residuated lattices, the equivalence between the theorem of contradiction and the doublenegation. However, in the setting of CHC models, whose elements are not self-contradictory, therefore, the elementsare restricted in L(0). We recall that if a residuated lattice L satisfies the double negation and x ∧ x(cid:3) = 0 for all x ∈ L,then L is a Boolean algebra [17]. Therefore, we first proved Proposition 4.1 above, by considering all elements in L,instead of in L(0) only.Remark. In Section 3, we proved that, in any orthocomplemented lattice L, if the theorem of contradiction holds,then L must be orthomodular, but, contrarily, even if L is an orthomodular lattice, the theorem of contradiction may nothold. We may naturally ask, in orthocomplemented lattices, what suitable condition, together with orthomodularity,is equivalent to the theorem of contradiction. Here, in residuated lattices, we have answered this question by showingthat the double negation condition and the theorem of contradiction are equivalent (Proposition 4.1). We knew that, inBoolean algebras, the theorem of contradiction always holds, but the premise condition—Boolean algebras, is strongerthan that of residuated lattices together with the double negation, because, as indicated above, a residuated lattice Lsatisfying the double negation and x ∧ x(cid:3) = 0 for all x ∈ L reduces to a Boolean algebra.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254251Since MV-algebras satisfy the law of double negation, the theorem of contradiction holds in the framework ofMV-algebras. Therefore, by means of Proposition 4.1 we have the following corollary, where, to be consistent, westill use the representation form of residuated lattices.Corollary 4.3. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete MV-algebra ((cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, 0, 1(cid:8) is a complete lattice). Then,for any P ∈ P(L) and any q ∈ L, q ∈ C∧(P ) iff q(cid:3) ⊗ (P ) = 0.(cid:3)Next we further deal with the CHC models in residuated lattices. Here we need an operator δ introduced inRef. [27], which is defined as follows: for any operator F on P(L) that represents the set of all subsets of L,δF = c ◦ F ◦ (cid:3), where (cid:3) and c represents orthocomplemented operation and complement operation, respectively (forexample, for any P ⊆ L, P (cid:3) = {p(cid:3): p ∈ P } and P c = L − P ), then in orthocomplemented lattices, the statements (2)and (3) in the following Corollary 4.5 hold naturally. However, in residuated lattices, we first have:Proposition 4.4. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete residuated lattice. Then the following three statementsare equivalent.(1) For any p ∈ L, p(cid:3)(cid:3) = p.(2) For any P ∈ P(L), δΦ(0)(3) For any P ∈ P(L), δΦ(0)∧ (P ) = H (0)∨ (P ) = H (0)∨ (P )∧ (P )·= {q ∈ L: q (cid:2)·= {q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)P }.P }.Here Φ(0)∧ (P ) and Φ(0)∨ (P ), to be distinguished from Φ∧(P ) and Φ∨(P ), are defined as follows:(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)Φ(0)∧ (P ) =q ∈ L: q (cid:2)P;Φ(0)∨ (P ) =(cid:4)q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:6)P.(cid:3)=(cid:3)(cid:6)c(cid:9)c)(cid:5)δΦ∧(P ) =Proof. It suffices to verify that (1) is equivalent to (2) and (3), respectively. We only demonstrate the equivalenceP ∈ L andbetween (1) and (2), because the other is analogous. First note that for any P ∈ P(L), and any p ∈ P ,p ∈ L always hold. If (1) holds, then(cid:8)Φ∧(P(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L:(cid:4)q ∈ L: q ⊗(cid:4)q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:4)q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:14): p ∈ P } → 0(cid:15) (cid:16)(cid:3) (cid:2) qP(cid:5)(cid:3) → 0(cid:3) = 0(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5){p====(cid:17)PPP(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:7)ai → 0 =(ai → 0)ii(cid:7)p∈P(cid:7)p∈P(cid:7)=q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:14)=q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:4)q ∈ L: q (cid:2)== H∨(P ).(cid:3) → 0)(pwith(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:3)p(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:9)with the condition (1)POn the other hand, let (2) hold. For any p ∈ L, take P = {p}. Clearly, also P ∈ P(L), andδΦ∧(P ) =(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:8))Φ∧(P= {q ∈ L: pc(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:2) q(cid:3)}c252D.

(cid:2)Since L(0) ⊆ L and P0 ⊆ P(L), we have the following corollary.Corollary 4.5. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete residuated lattice. Then the following three statementsare equivalent.(1) For any p ∈ L(0), p(cid:3)(cid:3) = p.(2) For any P ∈ P0(L), δΦ∧(P ) = H∨(P )(3) For any P ∈ P0(L), δΦ∨(P ) = H∧(P ).·= {q ∈ L(0): q (cid:2)(cid:2)P }.Proof. Actually, the proof is analogous to that of Proposition 4.4, only by substituting P0(L) and L(0) for P(L) andL, respectively. We therefore leave the details out. (cid:2)Remark. As mentioned above, in orthocomplemented lattices, statements (2) and (3) in Proposition 4.4 and Corol-lary 4.5 hold naturally. But, in residuated lattices, they are equivalent to the double negation condition, which, however,is still weaker than that of Boolean algebras.From Proposition 4.4 and the double negation of MV-algebras it follows the following corollary.Corollary 4.6. Let L = (cid:7)L, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8) be a complete MV-algebra. Then:(1) For any P ∈ P(L), δΦ(0)(2) For any P ∈ P(L), δΦ(0)∧ (P ) = H (0)∨ (P ) = H (0)∨ (P )∧ (P )·= {q ∈ L: q (cid:2)·= {q ∈ L: q (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)P }.P }.Finally, we deal with the structure’s theorem of hypotheses in residuated lattices.Example 5. The structure’s theorem of hypotheses in the framework of residuated lattices (also, MV-algebras) maynot hold; that is to say, there exist residuated lattice (also, MV-algebra) L and P ∈ P0(L) such that∗∧(P ) (cid:11)=H(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)P·=∧ A∧(P )(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:11)P(cid:6)∧ q: q ∈ A∧(P )(cid:3),where A∧(P ) = {q ∈ L(0): q ∧ (P ) ∈ L(0), qNC(P )}, H ∗∧(P ) = {q ∈ L(0): q (cid:2)(cid:3)P , q (cid:11)=(cid:3)P }.Proof. Let L be a complete residuated lattice (exactly, an MV algebra) of [0,1]-valued functions over some non-empty set X, that is, L = (cid:7)[0, 1]X, ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1(cid:8), where ∨, ∧, ⊗, →, 0, 1 are defined in the following: for eachtwo functions f, g ∈ [0, 1]X we put, for all x ∈ X,(cid:9)(cid:8)(f ∨ g)(x) = maxf (x), g(x)(cid:9)(cid:8)(f ∧ g)(x) = minf (x), g(x)(f ⊗ g)(x) = f (x) ⊗ g(x),(f → g)(x) = f (x) → g(x),,,where ⊗ is Lukasiewicz t-norm and → the corresponding residuum, namely,(cid:8)0, f (x) + g(x) − 1f (x) ⊗ g(x) = max(cid:9),(cid:9)(cid:8)1, 1 − f (x) + g(x)f (x) → g(x) = min,and let 0, 1 be two constant functions taking values 0 and 1, respectively.D. Qiu / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 239–254253Let P = {a}, where a is a constant function on X and a(x) = a for any x ∈ X, 1where L = [0, 1]X. Suppose b is also a constant function on X, satisfying b(x) = b for any x ∈ X, and 1Then it is clear that b ∈ H ∗implies f (x) = b for any x ∈ X, i.e., f = b and consequently, f (cid:2) a =(cid:3)claim is verified, and therefore b /∈ (2 < a < 1. Clearly, a ∈ P0(L),2 < b < a < 1.∧(P ); and for any function f ∈ A∧(P ), we claim b (cid:11)= f ∧ a. If not so, then b = f ∧ a(cid:3)P , which contradicts f ∈ A∧(P ). So, ourP ) ∧ A∧(P ). The proof is completed. (cid:2)Remark. However, in residuated lattices, ((cid:3)L(0):(cid:3)P (cid:11)(cid:2) q, q ∧ ((cid:10)(cid:5)P ) ∈ L(0)}. Then it is easy to check that(cid:11)∗∧(P ) =HP∧ B∧(P ).(cid:3)P ) ∧ A∧(P ) ⊆ H ∗∧(P ) always holds. Furthermore, set B∧(P ) = {q ∈Remark. In Boolean algebras, C∧ is the largest Tarsk’s consequence operator and Φ∧, in some sense, is the smallestexpansive and anti-monotonic operator [27]. However, the two results do not generally hold in the framework ofresiduated lattices (see [3]).5. Concluding remarksThe CHCs operators proposed newly in the framework of orthocomplemented lattices provide a new arena forperforming mathematical reasoning and reformulating those pivot theorems in classical logic. In this paper we haveclarified some important issues associated with certain CHC operators and have presented some characterizations inthe CHC models. The main points are summed up as follows: (1) We have verified that the orthomodular law is notthe necessary condition for characterizing the structure’s theorem of hypotheses. (2) Connections between implicationoperators and CHC operators have been investigated. We have used these CHC operators to describe a generalizedform of the theorem of contradiction, the deduction theorem, and the Lindenbaum theorem of classical logic. In par-ticular, we proved that the theorem of contradiction holding infers that the underlying lattices must be orthomodular.On the other hand, we have demonstrated that, however, in some orthomodular lattices, the theorem of contradictiondoes not holds. (3) We have re-defined the CHC operators in residuated lattices, and particularly discovered someessential differences between CHCs in orthocomplemented lattices and those in residuated lattices, showing that (i)the theorem of contradiction holds iff the residuated lattice under consideration satisfies the double negation, and (ii)the structure’s theorem of hypotheses in the framework of MV-algebras (therefore, residuated lattices) may not hold.An interesting issue emerges. Usually, it is under certain logic that we try to validate or invalidate a proposition ora theorem, and to apply reasoning. However, we may ask, what is the weakest, or the sufficient and necessary, logicfor holding a theorem or a proposition? This is a significant problem that may motivate us to consider further theseimportant results in AI and mathematics.Finally, it may be worth mentioning that dealing with the CHC models in other important algebras (such asBL-algebras [13,16], MV-algebras [2,13,15,16], Product algebras [13,16], Gödel algebras [13,16], Heyting algebras[1,16], and quantum algebras [8]) is also an intriguing issue worthy of further consideration.AcknowledgementsThe author is very grateful to the three anonymous referees for their invaluable comments that greatly helped toimprove the quality of the paper.
