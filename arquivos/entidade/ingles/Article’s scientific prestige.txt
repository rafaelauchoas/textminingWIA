IntroductionKnown as the most popular deliverable of scientific research, the peer reviewed article isconsidered a main carrier of new knowledge and information, presenting innovative findings,demonstrating unique contributions, and promoting openness and transparency in science. It isapparent that individual articles have different scientific impacts. Given the ever growing numberof publications in science, quantifying an article’s scientific prestige has been an important topicto fairly evaluate its contribution to the scientific progress, see, for example, Chu & Evans (2021);Chang et al. (2019); Zhao & Feng (2022); Li et al. (2019b); Nie et al. (2019); Tahamtan et al.(2016); Xiao et al. (2016).Given that all parts of science compete on the available research funding resources, and thatuniversities, and even countries try to evaluate and compare their respective scientific impact,we consider the problem of measuring the scientific prestige of individual articles in a settingwhere the size of the citation network is huge — that is, where the number of nodes (articles)and edges (citations/references) is at the million/billion level and all the disciplines in scienceare considered. We propose the Article’s Scientific Prestige (ASP) metric, based on the recentadvances in eigenvector centrality (or Pagerank) and optimization to address this large-scale dataanalysis challenge with computational tractability. More importantly, we attempt to perform acomprehensive citation analysis of all the published articles in various disciplines and over time,and provide a scientific comparison of several citation metrics at the level of individual articles.Our approach is motivated by a specific application: measuring the scientific impact of eachindividual article in the Web of Science (WoS) citation network. The top influential papers areeasy to spot. They introduce new terms and names and initiate research in a new area. Theleast influential papers are also easy to identify, as those articles are never cited and thus have2negligible impact. Evaluating the remaining articles is however challenging and how this shouldbe done remains an open question. The Number of citations (#Cit) and the journal grade havelong been used as metrics to show how much attention an article has received in the sciencecommunity. Note that the popular metrics are counting the number of times an entity (e.g., ascholar, an institute, or a journal), rather an article, has been cited, see, e.g., the Science CitationIndex (SCI) by Garfield (1955), CiteScore by Garfield (1972), H-index by Hirsch (2005), and theSCImago Journal Rank (SJR) by Gonz´alez-Pereira et al. (2010).It is hypothesised that themore citations an entity obtains, the higher scientific impact it has. Statistically speaking, suchan aggregation lowers the randomness and misjudge chance for an entity with many publicationscompared to an individual article. Simultaneously, it trivializes the individual impact of eachscientific work. Alternatively, it becomes common and recognized to judge an article’s scientificvalue by journal grade, i,e. which journal the article is published. Scholars partition journals inclasses like A*, A, B, C, and imply that at least on average the grade of the journal reflects thequality of the articles it publishes.Our main question of interest is to what extent the #Cit and journal grade are helpful toassess the impact of an individual article given a citation network. Though popularly adopted inall kinds of evaluations, one can easily find counter examples where either way fails. It has beenacknowledged that #Cit, though direct and convenient, is not comparable across disciplinesand over time given different publication frequency and citation duration.It has also beenargued that self-citation (i.e., author cites their own articles in another article) or community-citation (different authors, yet with strong academic connections) can easily abuse the metric.As for journal grade, a large portion of the articles have a much lower impact than the journal’saverage given the extremely skewed distribution of citations. Even the top-tiered journals have asubstantial number of articles that are not cited at all, implying one should not judge an article(solely) based on which journal publishes it.We perform a large-scale analysis on the Web of Science (WoS) citation network, with morethan 63 million articles and 1.45 billion citations on 254 subjects from 1981-20201. To demon-1After removing self-citations and articles without references or without a subject, we look at 33,200,017articles with 898,879,235 references from 254 subjects. There are 255 subjects in WoS. However, articles in the3strate the spectrum of citations on various disciplines, we compute the ASP of all the articlestogether, with which we assess the scientific influence of individual articles in the network. Toobtain an accurate quantitative measure of scientific prestige, we must solve two technical chal-lenges. The first is the large scale of the citation network, which requires an efficient optimizationapproach with computational tractability. Second is the hyperparameter choice in the eigenvec-tor centrality computation such as the damping factor, ensuring a stable performance and alsofair comparisons among various disciplines over time.We implement a parallel Jacobi iterations based algorithm on sparse data-structures to com-pute a steady-state solution for the ASP values, see Golub & Loan (2013) and Srivastava et al.(2019). Running on an 8-core Intel Core i7-9700K CPU at 3.60GHz, the algorithm takes lessthan 2 seconds per iteration and converges in less than 20 iterations. The efficient algorithmallows for a wide range search of hyperparameters, even for large-scale citation networks. Specif-ically, we determine the damping parameter to 0.5 and also adopt a citing window of 5 years forthe optimal stability of scientific contributions over disciplines and time.We found that ASP and #Cit are not aligned for most articles, with a growing mismatchamongst the less cited articles, although the two metrics display similar ranks among the top10% highly cited articles and are identical for the bottom 20-30% of articles (as those are nevercited). The journal grade, that is eventually determined by a few highly cited articles, is unableto properly reflect the scientific impact of individual articles. When aggregating to the journallevel, ASP is more consistent with the journal grade than #Cit. Moreover, we found that articleswith the largest ASP and #Cit were in the subjects of Science, Biology, and Geography, and thesmallest in Social Science, Arts, Law & Policy, and Education. The number of references andcoauthors are less relevant to scientific impact, but subjects do make a difference.We build our analysis on pioneering works. Many aspects of the current work, includingdata (the size, time interval, and diversity), algorithm (to estimate the eigenvector centralitymetric), and the empirical investigations at article level are novel with respect to the priorworks. Massucci & Docampo (2019) considered the citation network dataset of 5 disciplinessubject “Planning and development” do not have references.4– Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine; Business & Finance; Information Science & LibraryScience; Telecommunication; and Veterinary Sciences – from 2010 to 2014 provided by ClarivateAnalytics, and analyzed citation patterns at a university level. Ma et al. (2008) studied 236,517articles in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from 2003 to 2005 based on the Institute forScientific Information (ISI) database, see also Palacios-Huerta & Volij (2004). In terms of datasize, Chu & Evans (2021) conducted also a large-scale citation analysis with WoS data from1960 to 2014. The focus is to show that the gigantic increase of articles may impede the rise ofnew ideas instead of promoting the rate of scientific progress. Our paper is also related to otherworks on eigenvector centrality or Pagerank based metrics. Bergstrom (2007) and Gonz´alez-Pereira et al. (2010) computed a citation metric for academic journal evaluations (i.e., at journallevel) and the latter demonstrated the application on articles from 296 subjects but publishedin year 2007 only with the Scopus database.Our paper contributes a multi-disciplined citation analysis via connectivity in an extensivecitation network. For using eigenvector centrality, we measure the influence of individual articlesand provide a scientific comparison and statistics summary of several citation metrics at the levelof individual article. The framework that we develop can be applied to a broad class of citationanalysis problems in which the goal can be quantify the impact of an entity in a high-dimensionalsetting. Meanwhile, we are limited to the references within our database. By incorporatingarticles from online platforms such as arXiv.org and Social Science Research Network (SSRN),or data from crossref.org, we can update the citation analysis in the future.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the Web of Science data. Section 3details the method and the implementation algorithm. Section 4 implements the ASP to evaluatethe scientific contribution of articles. Section 5 discusses the comparison of ASP with respectto #Cit and journal grade, as well as relation to coauthors and references. Section 6 draws aconclusion.2. Web of Science DataOur primary source is the citation data of the Web of Science (WoS). We obtained the digitaldata from Clarivate Analytics via the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Japan. WoS is an5internet search platform that provides comprehensive citation data for 254 academic disciplines,including Natural Science, Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities, Arts, and so on. The WoScitation data contains 63,092,643 unique articles published in 65,045 journals2 with 953,967,411citations over 40 years from 1981 to 2020. Each article contains a number of attributes, includinginformation on the article (UID, Document type, DOI, Language, Title, Abstract, Discipline),author (Name and Affiliation), journal (Publisher Name, Journal Name, Year, Issue, Volume,Pages), and a list of references (citations received after publication and references cited in thearticle). See Appendix A.1 for a sample observation of an article titled “Basic local alignmentsearch tool” by Stephen Frank Altschul, Gish Warren, and others, published in 1990 in theJournal of Molecular Biology which received 58,002 citations, the highest in the data.The input of our main analysis is a directed hierarchical graph, where each node (vertex)represents an article and each arc (link/arrow) represents a reference/citation. In contrast to ourexpectations, the graph resulting from the data was not an direct acyclic graph (DAG) impliedby the toplogical order. The reason for this is that articles in the same year might referenceeach other, or, due to the different delays in review and publication, an article may reference afuture article, leading to directed cycles in the graph. We made the tree unidirectional in timeby only including references to articles of the same year or before the publication date of thereferencing article. Before creating the citation tree, we performed the following pre-processingsteps: 1) Remove 54,178 articles without subject information and 12,364,174 articles without anyreferences; 2) Ignore 346,988,766 reference links to publications outside of the data; 3) Restrictthe analysis to articles published in the time frame of 1990 to 2015 only and count citationsup to 5 years after publication of the article, but their references still traced back to 1981 andcitations up to 2020 in the computation. The resulting citation network contained 33,200,017articles with 898,879,235 references and 757,630,741 citations.We restricted the analysis time period of articles to 1990-2015 to avoid boundary bias dueto incomplete citations/references. The boundary effect is particularly severe in the earlieryears such as 1981, where references are completely missing leading to broken edges, and more2The average number of articles per journal per year is 94. The maximum number was 31,273 articles publishedin PLOSone in 2013.6recently, where articles published in, for example, 2020 are cited less often than those publishedin, for example, 1990. We also chose 5 years as the citing window. Intuitively, a fixed windowsize standardizes the time frame of citation metrics and allows the comparison of scientificcontributions fair between articles published a long time ago and those published recently. Italso means one focuses on the relevant immediate scientific impact of an article over the 5 yearsafter its publication. We admit that the 5-year window may not favour certain types of articlesor disciplines such as pure theoretical articles or arts works which usually need a longer time toexhibit impact on science. However, this choice is justified by the quantitative parameter choice,see Section 3.3. Data seems to support the choice too given that the average age for an articlereceiving its first citation is 2.3 years. The choice of 5 years is occasionally consistent with thecommon evaluation period adopted by many academic entities.Table 1. Statistical summary for #Cit, References, and Coauthors for articles between 1990 and 2015.Q1 Median Mean Q3Max#CitReferences(Co-)authors1102721322.8227.074.132236558,0027,3035,576Table 1 presents statistics of #Cit, References, and Coauthors of the WoS data from 1990to 2015 at article level. In general, all features are right skewed distributed. The median of#Cit is 7 per article meaning that 50% of the articles receive 7 or fewer citations within 5 yearsafter publication, while the mean is almost triple this with a value of 22.82. The skewness iscaused due to extremes. There are 22.53% of the articles not cited at all. In contrast, 25% ofarticles (Q3) have more than 22 citations, and the maximum citation counts reaches up to 58,002.Analogously, the distributions of the number of references and coauthors are right skewed toobut with less extreme values. About 75% of articles contain 36 references or less. The maximumreferences is 7,303, in the article entitled “Calcium-binding proteins 1: EF-hands” by HiroshiKawasaki and Robert H. Kretsinger (1995) published in Protein Profile. There is an asymmetrybetween the References and #Cit. The median reference count of 21 per article is triple to themedian #Cit. This possibly implies “citation clustering” where a few number of articles are7commonly cited by many other articles. The number of coauthors remains low, with a medianof 3, and 75% of articles are written by less than 5 authors. Although, in Physics collaborationssuch as Atlas (Switzerland) and Compact Muon Solenoid, published articles have more than1,000 coauthors. The article entitled “International prevalence, recognition, and treatment ofcardiovascular risk factors in outpatients with atherothrombosis” by Deepak L. Bhatt et al., andREACH Registry Investigators (2006) has 5,576 authors and was published in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association.Given millions of articles, almost a billion references, and 254 subjects, any comparison andinterpretation is challenging. Due to space limits, we aggregated the closely related subjects to ahigher level scientific cluster and present the comparison at the higher cluster level. Note that allcomputations are still based on the article level. We only present the statistics and visualizationat the cluster level, which such as median or mean are computed based on subjects of the samelevel. We identified 14 clusters based on the intensity of cross-citations and our knowledge ofscientific disciplines. Specifically, we computed cross citation intensity between any two subjectsby summing up the cross-citations between the two subjects and standardizing these valuesby the number of all articles in the two subjects. Given the intensity matrix, we adoptedthe graphical clustering approach (Wu et al. 2010) to form clusters according to the proximitymeasures, where subjects with high cross-citation intensity are grouped together, and subjectswith low cross-citation intensity are separated using the elliptical separation algorithm and theproperty of a converging sequence of iteratively formed correlation matrices, Chen (2002). Next,we manually fine tuned the clustering by merging subjects with similar topics. We obtained 14scientific clusters and presented a comparison among disciplines at the cluster level. AppendixA.2 lists the subjects contained in each cluster as well as the corresponding number of articles,references and citations.Figure 1 displays the cross-citation intensity matrix among the 254 subjects (panel a) and thecross-citation chord diagram among the 14 clusters (panel b). A visualization clustering packageGAP3 is used to arrange the 254 disciplines according to the proximity measures. In the intensity3The software is downloaded from: http://gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw/GAP/index.htm8(a)(b)Figure 1. Panel (a) Heatmap of the intensity of cross subject citation. The quantiles show the intensity of thecross citations between subjects. Panel (b) Chord diagram for the cross-citations among the 14 clustersmatrix, some cells along the diagonal demonstrate a high intensity of cross citations (coloured inred), with value > 74.8, the upper quartile of intensity, whereas some cells representing e.g. Artsand Science off the diagonal have low a intensity of cross citations (coloured in blue), with value <1.5, the lower quartile of intensity. This is consistent with the chord diagram in panel (b), whichalso gives a good impression of the proportion of the clusters regarding the number of articles.About half of the articles in WoS belong to either the Medicine or Biology cluster. There is highcross-citation among subjects in the common cluster, where links are circled back to the samecluster, with the line thickness reflecting the strength of interdisciplinary cross citations. Thechord diagram also shows that certain clusters such as Science and Biology do influence otherclusters. Specifically, Science (blue area) is cited intensively by Biology, Medicine, Engineering,Computer Science and others, with blue linked projects to these areas. Biology (green area)is cited by Medicine and Geography. Medicine (orange area) is cited by Science and Biology.Other clusters, in contrast, have less cross-disciplinary citations.9QuantileHCT

Method and Measure of ASP3.1. Eigenvector centralityWe propose ASP to evaluate the scientific prestige of an article, based on eigenvector cen-trality or Pagerank. The idea of using eigenvector centrality to analyze a citation network is notnew (see, e.g., Ma et al. 2008). However, we are now able to compute Pagerank on the millionsof node-graphs spanning all science disciplines in reasonable computational time. Articles to-gether with the references build a mostly acyclic graph, where the direction of arcs is important.The challenge however exists in the boundary, where the leaves (newest publications) have noincoming arcs. To remedy this border effect, we performed our computations on the full graphfrom 1981 to 2020, but only looked at the results of articles from 1990 to 2015.The ASP of an article i in a citation network of size N is defined as follows:ASP i = (1 − d) + dN(cid:88)j=1ASP jLij/mj(1)where Lij = 1 if an article j cites an article i and Lij = 0 otherwise, mj = (cid:80)k Lkj is thetotal number of articles that j links to. In other words, the ratio Lij/mj denotes the fractionof references article j has cited. The damping factor d influences how much “prestige” of anarticle is passed on to the references. If d is larger, more is passed on to the referenced (older)articles. As d gets smaller, the benefit of being cited decreases. The minimum value of ASP is1 − d, which means that the article is not cited. We argue that an article that is never cited, orequivalently has the minimum value of ASP, has negligible scientific impact.Present in matrix form, ASP is eventually an eigenvector of a Markov matrix.

From (1), we haveASP = ΩASP ,where ASP is the eigenvector of the matrix Ω with an eigenvalue 1. The matrix Ω follows theMarkov Chain withP (go from j to i) =(1 − d)/N + d/mj,ifj cites i,(1 − d)/N,ifj does not cite iwhich means that the chain moves from state j to state i with probability (1−d)/N +d/mj, if thepaper j cites the paper i, and with probability (1 − d)/N, otherwise. The transition probabilityis the mixture of either randomly starting from a new article with the probability 1/N , or followone of the references of the paper j with the probability 1/mj, respectively. If an article j hasmany references, the probability of going from j to a certain article i in the reference becomeslow.3.2. AlgorithmTo solve the above equation system, we implement parallel Jacobi iterations on sparse data-structures, resulting in a steady-state solution for the ASP computation, see Golub & Loan(2013) and Srivastava et al. (2019). The procedure is formulated in Algorithm 1. It begins byassigning an identical amount of prestige to each article. Next, this weight is redistributed in aniterative process whereby the articles transfer their attained weight to each other through thecitations. The process ends when the difference between articles’ prestige values in consecutiveiterations does not surpass a pre-established threshold. After setting up the data structures, thealgorithm typically takes less than 2 seconds per iteration and converges in less than 20 iterationswhen running on an 8 core Intel Core i7-9700K CPU at 3.60GHz.3.3. Damping factor and citing windowThere are two hyperparameters to choose in our algorithm. The damping factor d decideshow much of the incoming weight to a node is passed along to the referenced nodes. If a too-high11Algorithm 1 ASP computationInput: d = 0.5, N, Ω ∈ RN ×N , E ∈ RN ×N , M ∈ RN ,ASP (0) ∈ RN initialized equal to 1, (cid:15) = 0.01, k = 0Output: ASP1: procedure Jacobi-Iteration:while max |(cid:15)| ≥ 0.012:ASP (k+1) ← (1 − d) + dAM−1×ASP (k)3:(cid:15) =ASP (k+1)−ASP (k)4:5: end proceduredamping factor is chosen, the oldest articles would receive most of the ASP, since they have nooutgoing references within the data. When the damping factor is 1, the Markov chain matrixΩ becomes irreducible, meaning article j cannot reach article i in a finite number of steps. Forexample, the articles published in later years cannot be reached (cited) by earlier publishedarticles in the network. Therefore, if d = 1, ASP converges to zero. If a too-low value is chosen,all the weights would stay with the article, and very little would be conferred to the references.Moreover, as mentioned in the introduction, given the study period lasts 25 years from 1990to 2015, it is reasonable to have a fixed citing window for a fair comparison for articles withdifferent life lengths.The obvious question is what is a good damping factor, together with which citing window?By assuming that no subject should be better than another in terms of scientific contribution,we chose the hyperparameters that lead to the minimum variations among the 254 subjects.Specifically, we computed the average value of ASP in each subject. The difference is measuredbetween the subject average ASP and the average ASP among all articles. We conduct the abovecomputations for each year to avoid time impact. It shows that the choice of d = 0.5 and a citingwindow of 5 years led to the minimum deviation among the scientific disciplines. This choice isalso consistent with the fact that an article usually traces up to two consecutive articles (Chenet al. 2007). In the following, we conduct the citation analysis based on that choice in our study.Appendix A.3 details the choice.124. ASPWe summarize the statistics and distributional properties of ASP in this section. Table 2lists some statistics of ASP and #Cit summarized for the 14 clusters. Without exception, bothmetrics are right-skewed distributed and have extremely large values. For several clusters, themean is larger than the upper quartile (Q3), indicating the existence of extreme large values. Interms of ASP, Biology, Science, Medicine, and Psychology lead with the largest average valuesand there is a minor difference up to the upper quartile (Q3) among the top 4 clusters.Incontrast, Arts and Social Science have the lowest ASP, with 50-75% articles never being cited.Figure 2 panel (a) presents the dynamic evolution of the average ASP of the 14 clusters from1990 to 20154. Biology and Science are superior performers over time, with stable and largevalues. Medicine, though with the largest number of papers and citations, has been overtakenby Geography, City Development, Computer Science, Management, and Engineering in recentyears. Meanwhile, Law & Policy, Social Science, and Arts attract attention with steadily im-proved performance. Nevertheless, their overall impacts are still marginal compared to others.Education and Management are special, with a hump around 2005-2009, which may representtheir golden age due to the education reforms on pedagogy such as the “No Child Left Be-hind Act” introduced by the U.S. Act of Congress in the beginning of 2000 or the developmentE-commerce including online marketing and sales in management. Except for a few of thesevariations, there is generally a stable relative performance among the different disciplines overtime.The rank of clusters differs in terms of #Cit. When only direct citations are considered,Psychology and Medicine upgrade to #2 and #3, see Table 2 and Figure 2 panel (b). Thereare also larger deviations in magnitude among the clusters. The difference between #Cit andASP can be further illustrated using a single article as an example. The article “A short historyof SHELX” by George Michael Sheldrick (2008), which was published in Acta Crystallograph-ica Section A: Foundations of Crystallography has the maximum ASP of 1,570.09. The articlebelongs to the Science cluster, with the subjects of Chemistry, Multidisciplinary, and Crystal-4The median ASP for 14 clusters between 1990 and 2015 are piecewise constant over years and overlappingbetween clusters, see Figure A.2 in Appendix A.2.13lography. Although it received 803 #Cit only, which is much less than the highest #Cit, 58,002,its scientific prestige is higher due to indirect citations. Specifically, this article was cited byother articles with high impact, which eventually enhanced its influence in the citation network.For example, it was cited by the article “Structure validation in chemical crystallography” byAnthony L. Spek (2009) with the ASP of 234.37 and #Cit =10,412, and article “OLEX2: a com-plete structure solution, refinement and analysis program” by Oleg V. Dolomanov et al. (2009)with the ASP of 112.43 and #Cit =10,378. When counting all articles directly or indirectlylinked to the article, the citation counts is more than 80,000 . In other words, while a directcount of citations for the article is merely 803, there is an impact via indirect citations too. Andthe impact of the indirect citation is only considered in the computation of ASP.ClusterMin Q1 Median Mean Q3Max MinQ1 Median MeanQ3Max#CitASPScienceMedicineBiologyEngineeringSocial ScienceGeographyComputer ScienceArtsManagementPsychologyLaw and PolicyEducationBuildingCity DevelopmentTotal00000000000000023600300010000191116201120481213725.6427.7336.0912.185.7824.5011.400.9820.5927.858.429.4511.5312.1922.82242938102288016277911122253,34128,13458,00213,91210,32619,89433,1201,22813,70023,3452,4106,0632,5931,45758,0020.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.50.530.540.560.500.500.540.500.500.500.510.500.500.500.500.510.630.640.670.550.500.640.550.500.560.610.510.540.540.570.600.920.910.940.840.620.860.880.550.900.910.720.760.820.810.870.890.930.760.550.880.730.500.790.850.680.740.790.791,570.09550.591,097.45507.67168.35362.37768.8688.54280.47372.76130.34105.9068.4150.590.870.831570.09Table 2. Distribution of #Cit and ASP at cluster levelTo further illustrate the difference between the two citation metrics at article level, Figure 3presents the medians of ASP and #Cit for all 254 subjects, grouped into the 14 clusters. It showsthat Biology, Science, Medicine, Geography, and Psychology are more influential with largerASP. Arts and Management are usually less influential with smaller ASP. Note that ComputerScience has a surprisingly small ASP. This is due to the data restrictions on articles in our studyas conference proceedings is the main publication stream in Computer Science. There is a largervariation in Engineering, Social Science, and City Development, with both very large and very14(a) ASP(b) #CitFigure 2. Average values of ASP and #Cit for 14 clusters over years between 1990 and 2015small medians. At first glance, #Cit displays analogous distribution among the 254 subjects. Itis, however, interesting to note that the relative relation of subjects differs in terms of #Cit. Thedifference from cluster to cluster, for example Science vs. Arts, becomes dominant, comparedto that in ASP. Moreover, we observe much bigger variations within clusters. For example, thesubjects within Science have a larger difference when #Cit are used as metric. This implies thatASP is a more stable metric for different disciplines.Analogous to the Pareto principle in economics, right skewed distribution implies that, inthe citation network, very few articles have the most scientific influence or citations, while therest are rarely cited or not cited at all. We use the Pareto distribution to approximate the tailbehaviour of ASP, whose probability density function is defined as:p(x) = αxαmin/x1+α, x ≥ xmin > 0.The shape parameter α, also known as the tail index, describes the heaviness of the tail. Thelarger the tail index, the smaller the proportion of extreme values and vice versa for thinner15(a) ASP(b) #CitFigure 3. Medians of ASP and #Cit for all the 254 subjectstails. We estimate the tail index with a threshold of xmin to be the top 10% percentile of ASP,which is 1.88. Figure 4 presents the series of tail indexes estimated based on ASP (panel a)and #Cit (panel b) for the 14 clusters from 1990 to 2015. We found that there is an increasingtrend in ASP, indicating the increasing influence of a few top papers dominating the scientificcontribution in the science. Given the total number of publications is increasing, it also meansthat the ratio of irrelevant publications is rising. Arts, City Development, and Law & Policy areless extreme; one would expect increased imbalance severity with relatively fewer outstandingarticles in the cluster. In contrast, long tails are common in Engineering, Science, and ComputerScience. In contrast, both the magnitude and the increase in trend are weaker when #Cit areconsidered. While the average tail index of ASP increases from 1.58 to 2.63 over the years, itvaries from 1.43 to 1.88 for #Cit, and most clusters remain below 2, except Arts after 2005 andCity Development in 1990. This implies that, as a metric, ASP leads to less extreme distributionsthan #Cit.16(a) ASP(b) #CitFigure 4. Tail index for the ASP and #Cit published between 1990 and 20155. ASP and the alternative metrics5.1. ASP and #Cit#Cit is possibly the most commonly used evaluation metric for individual articles. Thoughdirect and convenient, citation count has been criticized for several shortcomings. As mentioned,the citation metric is not comparable across disciplines where the frequency of citation differs.For example, physics articles are published at a much higher frequency and are more likely to havehigher citation counts than mathematics articles. Also, self-citation or community-citation caneasily abuse citation counts. Even excluding self-citations, it is sometimes still unclear whetheran article is more important judging with higher citation counts alone. First, it depends on thetype of article. A survey article usually includes a lot references on average and will possiblybe cited more often.In some sense, a survey article may dilute the importance (if reflectedby citation counts) of some articles, as the latter would be cited as a whole as in the surveyarticle. Second, it also depends on the wide recognition of the work. Newton’s gravitational lawwould be directly used without citing the original work. A recent example is Roger Penrose’s17work “Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities” published in 1965. This articlelater won Penrose the “2020 Nobel Prize in Physics”, but received in total only 153 #Cit afterpublication up to December 2020 according to MathSci. More importantly, it lacks sufficientempirical evidence on how reliable the citation metric is at the article level.Given that ASP is computed based on citation counts but also considers the sequential impactof the article via indirect citations, i.e., influence of other articles that cite, questions arise: 1)what is the relationship between the two citation metrics and 2) which metric is more reliableand under which situations. We computed the Pearson correlations between ASP and #Cit.In the computation, we remove articles without citations, which correspond to about 22.53%articles as the values of #Cit are always zero and ASP always 0.5, leading to meaningless perfectcorrelation. Appendix A.4 presents the statistics of the articles without citation.We found that although the articles with the top 10% #Cit, i.e., the articles with highcitations, have similar ranks with ASP, the remaining 90% articles differ significantly. It meansit would be relatively safe to evaluate the scientific prestige of articles with either ASP or #Cit,but only for the top 10% articles, i.e., on average with more than 24 citations5. However, it wouldbe tricky by mixing the two metrics for the remaining articles. Figure 5 panel (a) presents thescatterplot of #Cit vs ASP. First glance shows strong connection with a correlation coefficientsof 0.82. One would expect that there is little difference of the two metrics for evaluating anarticle’s prestige. Given the long tails of both metrics and the sensitivity of the correlationcoefficients to outliers, we divided articles into deciles according to their sorted #Cit in eachcluster, after removing the non-cited articles. The first group contains the top 10% articles withthe highest #Cit in each cluster, and the last group (#10) has the last 10% of articles with thelowest #Cit for each cluster. The boxplot of the Pearson correlation coefficients between ASPand #Cit is displayed in panel (b) for each of the 10 groups. Except the top 10% articles havea high correlation at 0.804, the remaining 90% articles have, on average, correlations below 0.2.The correlation, in general, drops further when the decile increases. There is generally a similarpattern for different clusters. Appendix A.5 presents the correlation coefficients of decile groups5The 90% of all the articles have less than 11 citations. For articles with at least 1 citation, the 90% quantileis 2418for each of the 14 clusters over time, where correlation is high among the top 10% articles, andlow for the rest.(a)(b)Figure 5. Panel (a). Scatterplot of #Cit vs the ASP and the fitted line. Panel (b). Pearson correlation of ASPand #Cit in 10 groups and over years between 1990 and 2015. Each group includes the correlation values withrespect to subjects and deciles over years. Each decile is obtained by dividing articles in each subject into 10equal groups according to their sorted #Cit5.1.1. Coincidence among the “top” articlesTo verify the relationship between the two metrics, we select some individual articles toperform a detailed investigation. Table 3 lists the top 20 articles in each metric and theircorresponding ranks. There are 10 articles that appear in both top 20 rankings, including thearticle with the maximum #Cit of 58,002 (ASP of 1097.44 ranked #2). Meanwhile, there are alsoarticles, within the top 10%, exhibit “big” differences in ranks. The article “A short history ofSHELX” with ASP=1,570.09 and #Cit =803 is ranked as 1st according to its ASP but 33, 229thfor its #Cit, which is still in the top 10%. In contrast, the article “Hallmarks of Cancer: TheNext Generation” with a relatively lower ASP=206.64 but larger #Cit =27,946 is ranked 195thaccording to its ASP and 18th according to its #Cit. The comparison reconfirms the strongcorrelation of the two metrics for highly influential and highly cited articles within the topgroup.19Table 3.

The list is retrieved from the Harvard Nobel prize papersdatabase by Li et al. (2019a). We found, among the Nobel prize winning papers, 21 articlesare ranked in top 1% in both #Cit and ASP and 3 are higher ranked according to ASP, in the95th, 90th, and 65th percentiles, and lower ranked according to #Cit, in the 72th, 85th, and 59thpercentiles, supporting the argument that both metrics are reliable for evaluating the prestigeof articles, although ASP provides more accurate rankings than #Cit when the articles are nothighly cited, see Table 4.Moreover, it seems that ASP alleviates citation inflation towards certain types of articles.We use Computer Science as an example. Table 5 lists the articles that appeared in the top20 rankings of ASP and #Cit in the cluster. Articles in the top ASP ranking come from moreconcentrated topics: machine learning, control, information systems, and so on.In contrast,articles on the #Cit are led by applied papers published in interdisciplinary fields, includingPhysics, Biomedical Informatics, and so on, which usually receive many more citations comparedto pure Computer Science articles. This may imply that ASP instead of #Cit makes for fairercomparisons when evaluating articles from different research orientations.20Table 4.

Examples of other groupsThe story is different for other groups where the two metrics are not compatible. Heuristically,an article can be considered influential if it is cited by many articles, or if it, though not directly21cited by many, is cited by other influential article(s) with many citations. As mentioned, #Citcounts only direct citations, while ASP is able to reflect the prestige including these indirectcitations. An Engineering article “Blind decorrelation and deconvolution algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output system: I. Theorem derivation” was ranked as high in the 99th percentile(top 1%) with ASP value (21.75) but relatively low in the 23th percentile by #Cit (with 1 count).The Computer Science article “A computer algebra system based on order-sorted algebra” wasranked in the 99th percentile by the ASP (19.94) but in the 30th percentile by #Cit (with 2counts). The Social Science article “Vision and the autonomous symbol in the works of Lorrain,Jean-stage sets and obstacles” was ranked in the 99th percentile by the ASP (17.34), but in the23th percentile by #Cit (with 1 count). Although the above may be argued as special cases, thereare more examples of articles with small #Cit but high ASP. Specifically, 43.83% of articles havehigh ASP values and a small number of citation counts. In contrast, there are 33.62% articleswith low ASP but high #Cit.5.2. ASP and Journal GradeHistorically, journals are used to publishing (printing and distributing) scientific results butless so in this millennium. One can find important publications in arXiv.org even though they arenot published in known (refereed) journals. Journals are also used to cluster/sort/filter articlesregarding particular topics. If one looks into “Applied Statistics,” articles in the journals, oneexpects articles to be about applied statistics. Over the years, there might have been a shiftin the topics, so the journal name might not exactly match its contents anymore. Importantjournals (by the usual metrics) like Science or Nature are not sorted by topic at all. Since themid-20th century, under the hypothesis that the more citations an entity (e.g., a scholar, aninstitute, or a journal) receives, the higher scientific impact it has, citation-based metrics havebeen developed and became popular, particularly for evaluating a journal’s scientific prestigeat the journal level, where the total citation counts of all articles published in the journal areconsidered over a certain time period. See, for example, Science Citation Index (SCI), CiteScore,Impact Factor (IF), Hirsch’s bibliometrics index (H-Index), and SCImago Journal Rank (SJR).Given the publicly available journal-level citation metrics, it becomes common and recognizedto judge an article’s scientific value based on which journal publishes it.22Admittedly, an article published in a highly regarded journal is more likely to be read andcited, increasing its chances of becoming “important” and influential in scientific society. How-ever, it is often misleading to evaluate an article’s scientific prestige indirectly based on a journal’srank. The quality of an article is unlikely to change with a journal’s impact. Instead, a journal’svalue will be improved if it publishes important articles. Meanwhile, the distribution of #Cit isright-skewed with a long tail slowly fragmenting towards the extremely large citations, implyingthat the majority of papers published in the top tiered journal are overvalued when judging withjournal prestige. Figure 6 presents the empirical density of #Cit in Nature (ISSN: 0028-0836,1476-4687) from 1981 to 2020. The journal issued by Nature Research is a prestigious journalin multidisciplinary science and has been well recognized by the journal-level citation metrics,with an IF of 42.778 in 2019, H-index of 1226, and SJR of 15.993 in 2020. According to journalgrade information, its max, min, median of #Cit are 3157, 1, and 4, respectively and ASP are60.68, 0.5, and 0.5, respectively. Given that Nature is considered as one of the most prestigiousjournals, all the papers should have higher chances of being cited. Nevertheless, among the121,107 articles published in the journal obtained from the WoS data between 1981 and 2020,36.56% were never cited, yet all would be considered top publications if journal grade is used asan evaluation metric.Figure 6. Histogram for #Cit for articles published between 1981 and 2020 in Nature (ISSN: 0028-0836, 1476-4687)Simultaneously, an important article may be undervalued if it is not published in a prestigious23journal. Some essential works have been known, to introduce innovations that are too advanced,were rejected by conservative referees and published in less prestigious journals. A famousexample is the article “The market of lemons,” written by George Akerlof in 1966 which won the2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The article was rejected by three renownedjournals and was finally accepted and published upon the fourth submission in 1978 in TheQuarterly Journal of Economics.Table 6.

When merging thedata according to ISSN, 35,952 journals had complete information, among which 10,814 journalshave both citation and ASP records. We then conducted a statistical analysis to investigate therelation between ASP and journal grade. Table 6 presents the range of mean, median, min, andmax of ASP and #Cit of journals according to the journal grade. It shows that, in terms ofaverage value, ASP and #Cit, when aggregated to journal level, are consistent to the SJR journalgrade. However, the minimum average of #Cit increases from Q1 to Q4 level journals, meaningthat #Cit is not aligned to journal grade, where Q4 journals supply the minimum average of0.04. Moreover, the maximum of min #Cit a journal can get shows that some Q4 level journals6We followed SJR ranking to separate journals into 4 groups: Q1 to Q4. We separated the H-index accordingto quartile, leading to 4 groups labelled as H1 to H4.24are superior with 28 citations, while the Q1 level journal has only 13 cites. The inconsistencybetween #Cit and journal grade disappears when the H-index is used. This is no surprise as theH-index essentially reflects the same information as the total number of citations according toprobability theory, see Krattenthaler (2021).Nevertheless, we argue that journal grade is not the right metric to evaluate an article’sscientific prestige. Figure 7 demonstrates the distribution of ASP in 4 journals in the cluster ofMedicine with different SCImago Journal Ranks (SJR) by Gonz´alez-Pereira et al. (2010). Thehistograms show the ASP distribution in Medicine journals, namely Molecular Therapy withSJR2020 = 3.871, Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety with SJR2020 = 1.023, VeterinaryRecord with SJR2020 = 0.261, and Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift with SJR2020 = 0.151.It shows that the ASP follows logarithmic law distribution regardless of the journal grade,where 60.74%, 72.59%, 61.43% and 50.60%, respectively, are not cited. This means that nomatter where an article is published, there is a chance of no scientific influence. For the articlespublished in grade I journals, this is more questionable given that the high journal grade enhancesthe visibility of articles. In short, an article should not be judged solely based on the grade ofthe journal it is published in.5.3. References and CoauthorsThe WoS data shows that most articles (75%) are coauthored by no more than five authorsand 75% of articles have no more than 36 references. Figure 8 presents the median of referencesand coauthors per article for the articles published from 1990-2015.In terms of references,Biology leads with 50% of articles referring to 6-10 previous articles, followed by Medicine with5-7 references.In general, there is a mild increase of references per article in almost all theclusters, yet at different rates. Science exhibits a dramatic increase from four references perarticle in 1990 to nine in 2015. Geography and Psychology display significant increases too,though at a slower speed. Arts, Education, and Law & Policy have the smallest number ofreferences, though a sharp increase has occurred since 2010. Computer Science appears at thebottom, possibly because conference proceedings rather than articles are more recognized in thiscluster.Regarding the number of coauthors, Medicine and Biology on average involve a bigger team,25(a) Molecular Therapy(b) Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety(c) Veterinary Record(d) Deutsche Medizinische WochenschriftFigure 7. ASP distribution for Medicine articles published in four journals in different quartile of SJR2020 ranking.Articles are published between 1990 and 2015and the median increases over time and has reached five coauthors in recent years. On the otherhand, Social Science, Arts, and Law & Policy have smaller size, where at least 50% of articles aresole-authored. Science, Computer Science, Engineering, and Geography have had increasinglymore coauthors over the recent years. The median number of authors in Computer Scienceincreased from one in 1990 to four in 2015 on median. The trend is not always monotonic inother clusters. There is, for example, a continuous increase in in the number of coauthors inBuilding from 2008-2012, followed by a sudden drop from 2013-2015.26To what extent is references or number of coauthors helpful to improve ASP? Figure 9presents the scatter plot of the ASP versus the number of coauthors (panel a) and references(panel b). We find there is no evidence that more references or more coauthors improve ASP.(a) References(b) CoauthorsFigure 8.

We proposed the ASP index to evaluate the scientific im-portance of individual articles in the network using the eigenvector centrality metric. We foundthat there is a high correlation between the ASP and the #Cit among the top 10% of articlesbut a significantly minor dependence for the rest articles. There is little evidence of influenceof the number of references and coauthors on the article’s scientific quality. Furthermore, ASPminimizes the difference in scientific quality distribution among the disciplines. In consistent tothe fact that the quality distribution of journal articles is dramatically right-skewed, the articles’scientific prestige should not be judged based on the journal grades, which is supported by ouranalysis. With a parallel algorithm on sparse data-structures, we can obtain the ASPs for over30 million articles in a few seconds, demonstrating that it is computationally feasible to evaluateall articles individually. Without question, there is still room for improvement in evaluating theprestige and impact of scientific articles. Our analysis showcases that there is no computationalhurdle from including further aspects. For example, the increasing use of unique and well definedIDs like OrcID will allow in the future a reliable evaluation of author/co-authorship relationsover multiple articles and citations. Meanwhile, the quality of the data is of crucial importance.We noticed that it seems very likely that a considerable number of references is missing fromWoS, though it corresponds to small percentage in the large-scale citation network. Publicationschannels continue to expand, the importance of Proceedings and Open Access repositories e.g.arXiv.org, or self publishing via Social Media like ResearchGate is constantly increasing. Maybeit is time to end judging a publication by where it is published but to compute individually howmuch “prestige” it manages to attract. As an additional benefit this would make the introductionof new publication outlets much easier.7.

Sample of the Web of Science dataset for the most cited article entitled ”Basic local alignmentsearch tool” published in 1990 in Journal of Molecular Biology with the UID ”WOS:A1990ED16700008” and 5coauthors.A.2 The 14 clusters and 254 subjectsWe group the disciplines into 14 scientific clusters where the cluster information is summarisedin Table A.1. Science and Medicine form the two biggest groups, by 43 and 56 disciplines30respectively. The two clusters also have the largest number of articles with more than 8.7millions for each. This is almost double of the 3rd largest cluster, Biology. In terms of citations,the 3rd largest cluster Biology stands out with a median of 16, while Medicine and Geography,the second best, have 11 citations on average, which are 5 citations less than Biology.It isalso interesting to note that Psychology, though with much less articles published (0.6 millionarticles), and relatively smaller citations (8 each article), has the largest number of references(30 per article). Among the 14 clusters, Social Science and Arts have 0 median citation, whichmeans 50% of articles in the two clusters are never cited. The two clusters also have the smallestnumber of references (1 per article).In the analysis, each article is assigned to exactly one cluster according to the label ofdisciplines. While 79.26% of articles has one cluster, including articles with sole subject andarticles with multiple subjects belonging to the same cluster, the rest belongs to multiple clusters.Among them, 7.24% articles are labelled to the cluster with the most common disciplines, and13.49% articles with equal amount of subjects belonging to two and more clusters are labelledaccording to the first discipline in the WoS citation dataset.Figure A.2 displays the medians of ASP for each cluster and in each year. Unlike citationsthat are always monotonically increasing, even only within 5 years citations are considered,ASP provides a different view in terms of scientific prestige of an individual paper. It showsthat an article may have both increasing and decreasing prestige values in the citation network,depending on its impact on other articles over time. In general, Biology and Science are moreinfluential with higher ASP than other clusters. Medicine, though with the largest number ofpapers and citations, has been overtaken by Geography, City Development, Computer Science,Management and Engineering in the recent years, especially after 2000. Law & Policy, SocialScience and Arts have improved their impact in recent years. Nevertheless, their overall impactsare still marginal compared to others. Education and Management are special, with a humparound 2005-2009, which may possibly be their golden age. There is a big drop in Educationafter that.31Table A.1.

To measure the stability, we compare the scaled average value of32Figure A.2. Median ASP for 14 clusters over years between 1990 and 2015.ASP over years. Specifically, we compute the average value of ASP in each subject. We displaythe sum over the difference between the subject ASP and the average ASP among all articles.To avoid the time impact, we conduct the computations for each year, see Figure A.3. It showsthat the choice of d = 0.5 and citing window of 5 years led to the minimum deviation among thescientific disciplines. By assuming that no subject is better than another in terms of scientificcontribution, we chose the hyperparameters that lead to the minimum variations among the 254subjects over years.33Figure A.3. Time evolution of subject scientific impact variations given various combination of damping factorand citing window between 1990 and 2010.A.4 Articles without any citationsFigure A.4 presents the series of non-cited articles in the 14 clusters over time. Recallthat 22.53% articles have never been cited, the distribution differs among clusters. Science andMedicine have a relatively low ratio of non-citations, i.e. 40% around 1990-1994 and continuouslydrops to less than 20% in 2015. Medicine keeps a stable ratio around 40%. Geography showsimpressive improvement, with the ratio decreasing from 48% in 1990 to 18% in 2015. Anothercluster City Development reduces the ratio even from 80% in 1990 to 30% in 2015. Arts andSocial Science have the highest non-cited ratio, where most, e.g. more than 90% and 78% articles,are never cited within 5 years.34Figure A.4. Counting ratio of non-cited articles to total articles per cluster over years between 1990 and 2015.A.5 Correlation of the 14 clusters from 1990 to 2015Figure A.5 shows the boxplots of Pearson correlation coefficients between ASP and #Cit in10 decile groups over years from 1990 to 2015. Each group includes 14×26 correlation coefficientswith respect to 14 clusters and 26 years. We can see that the correlation is high for the top 10% articles with highest #Cit in most clusters. The rest have lower average correlation (below0.3). It may indicate that although the top articles have similar high ranks according to theirASP and #Cit, the ranks for the rest will differ in terms of the two different evaluation metrics.In other words, it is relatively safe to directly use #Cit to evaluate the highly cited papers (top10%), but for the rest, the evaluation of the #Cit may differ significantly from the ASP, whichrepresents the scientific attention of the article.35Figure A.5. Pearson correlation of ASP and #Cit in 10 groups and over years between 1990 and 2015. Each groupincludes the correlation values with respect to clusters, deciles and years. Each decile is obtained by dividingarticles in each cluster into 10 equal groups according their sorted #Cit. Group 1 belongs to the top 10% articleswith highest #Cit in each cluster.36ReferencesBergstrom, C. (2007).
