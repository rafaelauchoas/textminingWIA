An abstract argumentation In this paper, we develop a theory of abstract argumentation system is a collection of “defeasible proofs”, called arguments, that is partially ordered by a relation expressing the difference in conclusive force. The prefix “abstract” indicates that the theory is concerned neither with a specification of the underlying language, nor with the development of a subtheory that explains the partial order. An unstructured language, without logical connectives such as negation, makes arguments not (pairwise) incompatible. Incompatibility and difference in conclusive force cause defeat among arguments. The aim of the theory is to find out which arguments eventually emerge undefeated. These arguments are considered to be in force. Several results are established. The main result is that arguments that are in force are precisely those that are in the limit of a so-called complete argumentation sequence. @ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. inconsistent, but (groupwise) Keywords: Nonmonotonic logic; Defeasible reasoning; Argumentation *This research has been conducted at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, at the Rijksuniversiteit Limburg, and at the Washington University in St. Louis.

If the ends fit, such a chain can be made into a cycle of three successively defeating arguments. (c) Most systems have difficulties with a situation in which it is not clear which argument should win. One possibility is to keep up all arguments, and continue reasoning with them in different “worlds”. This approach has become known as credulous reasoning. (Cf. [42] : multiple extensions; [7] : multiple contexts; [ 271: multiple belief spaces; [ 281: clusters of worlds.) A second possibility is to do away with every argument, on the basis of the idea that the arguments neu- tralize each other. This approach has become known as skeptical reasoning. (Cf. [ 21,30,36,45] : collective defeat. Horty and Thomason [ 161 introduce a mech- anism of skeptical defeat that is slightly more refined.) A third possibility is to undefeated”, “provisionally un- introduce three classes of arguments-“ultimately that all arguments that are involved in defeated” and “ultimately defeated”-such an ambiguous conflict are considered as “provisionally undefeated”. (Cf. [ 361.) Prakken uses a similar triple “preferred”, “defensible”, “defeated”. (Cf. [ 391.) The problem is that none of these options is completely satisfactory. In [55] several examples are adduced and elaborated to show that, in some situations, the above approaches lack expressive power in order to describe counterbalanced or ambiguous argument conflicts. In a nutshell, the problem is that if, for in- stance, ~1, q, rt and 72 are arguments such that ~1 interferes with a2 and 71 interferes with 72, then all arguments “stay alive” in different worlds in the cred- ulous approach, “eliminate” each other in the skeptical approach, or are placed in the grey pool of “provisionally defeated” arguments in Pollock’s/Prakken’s approach. It is not possible to formally express, for example, that (+I depends only on (~2, or that (~1 does not depend on 71. (d) Almost all systems include a detailed and elaborated specification of defeat among arguments. A representative example is [21]. (Cf. point (3) above.) It is not only indicated which argument is stronger than another, but it is also indicated why an argument is stronger than another argument. However, for most of these detailed specifications of defeat it is possible to construct counterex- amples for which an unintentional argument emerges undefeated. To obtain a counterexample, it suffices to construct two syntactically isomorphic but seman- tically different situation descriptions, such that an undefeated argument is right according to the first semantic interpretation but wrong according to the second semantic interpretation. (Cf. [ 511.) Thus, it can be shown that detailed and carefully specified definitions of defeat are often overspecified. An overspecified definition “takes sides” in cases where it is better to abstain. At the other side of the spectrum we find Lin and Shoham’s argument system [20]. In [ 201, a logical hierarchy between arguments is absent. This lacuna makes it impossible to determine which arguments remain undefeated. It is reasonable to consider the latter as a problem. In this paper, a theory of abstract argumentation systems is developed. An abstract argumentation system is a collection of defeasible proofs, called arguments, of varying conclusive force. G.A. W VreeswijkIArtificial Intelligence 90 (1997) 225-279 229 In the proposed theory, the above problems are solved in the following way. (a) To avoid problems with suppositional arguments (cf. [ 361)) they are excluded from our theory. Our approach is to put the issue temporarily on the shelves until there is a better understanding of more simple forms of defeasible reasoning. (b) The anomaly in Loui’s system [21] is avoided by the stipulation that argu- ments cannot become stronger if they are made longer. This natural and intuitive principle is enforced in Definition 2.12. (c) An abstract argumentation system can handle situations in which it is not clear which argument should win. Within an abstract argumentation system, it is possi- ble to describe critical situations, not only with provisionally defeated arguments [ 33,36,45] but also with a defeasible entailment relation /-Q that is able to formally distinguish and express the various depen- dency relations across (groups of) arguments. The latter is demonstrated, among others, in Example 4.31. and extensions [ 7,9,27,42], (d) In abstract argumentation systems, potentially involved criteria of adjudication are put into an order of conclusive force. This order is supposed to contain all the relevant information concerning the relative strength among arguments. The order of conclusive force used is partial, which means that some pairs of arguments are incomparable. In some situations, even rno~r arguments cannot be compared. This “inability” is not necessarily disadvantageous. Sometimes, there is simply not enough information to arrange a complete hierarchy among arguments. In such situations, incomparability is still better than overspecification and arbitrary conflict resolution. That we speak of abstract argumentation systems in particular, is motivated by re- search of which the findings are reported in [ 5 11. In that paper, we were interested in the feasibility of formulating general, but nontrivial, principles for determining the relative strength among arguments. This has been done because a notion of conclusive force lays the basis for a theory of defeat and, conversely, a theory of defeat presupposes a notion of conclusive force in which we can speak about the relative strength of argu- ments. The conclusion was that, in a formal theory that works on the basis of syntactical principles, it is difficult to formulate general but nontrivial principles that consistently pronounce upon the conclusive force of symbolically represented arguments. Conclusive force is not only determined by syntactical structure. Generally, further information is needed from the semantics of the domain of discourse to have a definite saying in which argument is stronger than the other. In any case, the whole issue seems to be sufficiently difficult to avoid it altogether, and to assume that an order on arguments already has been given. This assumption saves us from the responsibility of telling how and why a particular argument should overrule any other particular argument. The present paper thus attempts to understand the workings of defeat in its own right, freed from the involvements with specificity and conclusive force in which it was enmeshed in the earlier discussions. In spite of these abstractions (or simplifications, for that matter), and given the impov- erishment of the background language (there are, for instance, no genuine propositional the texture of the resulting formalism is surprisingly rich. This indicates connectives), 230 GA. M?

The rationale behind only if all subsets of 2 are either compatible with (+ or undermined to the second clause, upto the additional this additional condition is that (+ is enabled by 2 condition by g.

Let P = {p}. Let us, by way of example, whether Since p + q =+ r ends with a defeasible 4.4(3), which states that p + q + r is enabled by 2 = {p,p + q} on the basis of P if and only the if p + q is enabled by 2, and 2 does not contain defeaters of p =S q =+ r. Since is readily fulfilled. Hence, entire set 2 is compatible with p + q + r, the last condition to the problem whether the problem whether p + q + r is enabled by 2, reduces its the same line of reasoning immediate p + q is enabled by 2. Following to the problem as above, whether p is enabled by 2. This, however, follows easily from Definition 4.4( l), since p E P. Hence, that p + q + r is enabled by 2. the argument p + q is enabled by 2 which, on its turn, subargument this problem reduces one step further (via Definition 4.4(3)) to Definition implies This example is pretty straightforward. An example that works out differently, is the following. Consider the abstract argumentation system A of Example Example 4.6 (Enablement). 4.5, with P = {p}. Let us now determine whether p + q is enabled by 2 = {p,p + q, p + s} on the basis of P.

Conversely, This example shows a number of characteristic properties of the enablement operator. To begin with, we see that, for every set of arguments 2, if 2 is small, then enublep( 2) is small.

Inductive warrant idea behind inductive warrant A theory of inductive warrant and that this hierarchy of defeat can be continued and so on. As opposed is able to deal with complex is based on the idea that defeaters can be defeated themselves, indefinitely. Thus, defeaters can be defeated by defeater-defeaters which, on their turn, can be defeated by defeater- to enablement, which is about primary defeat, defeater-defeaters, forms of defeat, such as cascaded defeat inductive warrant and reinstatement. The basic is as follows. We begin with a fixed base that are based on that particular base set are divided to be in force. At at level 1, so that level 2 contains set. The idea is that all arguments into different level 2, some arguments precisely some arguments at level 2 themselves. Therefore, 2 are reinstated level 3 should be given up, as they are defeated by level-2 arguments and/or arguments that were reinstated is from [31,36]. at level 1. At level 3, at level 2, are defeated that were defeated at level at that were reinstated at level 3. And so forth. The concept “level-n argument” at level 3. At level 4, some of the arguments at level 1 that were defeaters of arguments that are not defeated by arguments levels. At level 1, every argument are defeated by arguments some of the arguments is simply declared those arguments If these ideas are formulated in the current vocabulary, we obtain the following definition.

An argument A is acceptable w.r.t. a set of arguments S if, for every argument B: if B attacks (i.e., defeats) A, then B is attacked (i.e., defeated) by S. (In our terminology: (+ is accepted by S if every defeater of CT is defeated by a subset of 2.) Dung’s characteristic function FA,z? is given by FA,v(S) =kr {A 1 A is acceptable w.r.t. S}.

First, we see that, for every 1 < i < n, the argument ui is defeated and reinstated (i - 1) /2 times if i is odd, and defeated i/2 times and reinstated (i - 2) /2 times if i is even. So the arguments oi for which i is odd, emerge undefeated eventually. Further, we see that odd info’s are big, while even info’s are small. More precisely, we see that the odd info’s, as a sequence of sets of arguments, are monotonically decreasing, while the even info’s are monotonically increasing. Moreover, we see that every even info is contained in every odd info. These findings are not typical for the case at hand. They hold in general: Proposition 4.14.

An argument u is ultimately defeated defeated arguments (2) (3) The terms “ultimately (un) defeated” and “provisionally defeated” are from [ 3 1,361. ” The upper and lower limit of a sequence of sets of arguments are defined as follows. The upper limit is defined as lim sup, & of (&),E, flrn Zi; the lower limit lim infn & of (&),T, is defined as Uz, is monotonically decreasing, then lint, Z;, is defined is defined only if this sequence is either monotonically increasing or is monotonically increasing, i.e., if, for every n > 1, we have Z;, & n,T, Urn X;.

In the theory on defeasible dialectics, it is indeed the case that arguments that are not ultimately defeated on the basis of P, can be defended successfully in an A-debate on the basis of P. More in particular, the arguments that are ultimately undefeated can be defended successfully in finite depth, while arguments that are provisionally defeated (in P&ken’s terminology: argu- ments that are defensible), can be defended successfully only in debates of infinite depth. (If the debate is carried out relative to a finite argumentation system, this means that parts of the debate are reiterated.) So Prakken’s notion of defensible indeed corresponds to its intuitive meaning. Still, within the current setting, where dialectical considerations are not at issue, the more neutral “provisionally defeated” is probably a better choice. G.A.W.

If two enemies are ventilated together, they will probably start a fight with all the unpleasant consequences which that may have. Problem: select a large group of prisoners without enemies. If prisoners edges, the problem graph (see Fig. 6). are represented by points and their hostile comes down to finding a maximal relationship set of independent is represented points by in a The notion of a maximal Let G = (YE) be a graph with vertices I of V is called subset of V is muximully independent all its proper supersets are not independent. independent if there are no edges points can be formally defined as follows.

Therefore, the argument p + r + s cannot be in force as well, as it fails to fulfill condition (iii).

Since remains only to be examined. To begin with, we observe that is incompatible with if p + s + t E 2, since p + s + t is the only argument than p =+ s + t-as p + q + r. However, the argument p + q =+ r is not stronger a matter of fact, we even have p + q + r < p =+ s -+ t-so that, if p * would be in force, the set 2 = {p + s --f t} would invalidate condition let us determine whether p + s 4 P b p + s --+ t if and only an earlier stage of this example, we already observed of p + s. Hence, in turn, This, not in force, it can be concluded condition (iii). Therefore, the definition, we have the rule s -+ t is in R. In that P b p + q at the expense (i’) does not hold. that p + s + t cannot be in force. And because p + s --f t is fulfilled, condition that (iii) can be invalidated that there exists no set of arguments 2 that invalidates the argument p + s is not in force, and condition if (i’) P k p + s, and (ii’) if (i) P b p + q, (ii) t is in force. According (i) and (ii) are clearly that P b p + q =+ r. It follows implies (iii). s + t literature, In recent is, in our terminology, an argument the argument p + s -+ t is called a zombie path. ‘* A zombie that is not in force, but in some way still path in the interplay of defeat among arguments. The idea, then, is that zombie participates paths would give the final blow to arguments the interaction with other arguments. The previous example, however, shows otherwise. For p =+ s -+ t, it shows (here, p + s), the original argument though p + s + t is stronger example, but goes through is not the case only with this in general.

Consider the abstract argumentation system A with language JZ = {p, q, r, s, t} U {I}, with rules R = {P * 49 q * rvp * s,p * t} u {q, s -+I; r, t +I} (22) and with a basic order on arguments <. Let P = {p}. We are going to determine whether the argument p + q + r is in force. According to Definition 4.17 we have P k p =s q + r if (i) P t_ p + q, (ii) the rule q + r is in R, and (iii) every set of arguments 2 that is in force is not a defeater of p + q + r. Condition (iii) can be simplified by observing that (iii) holds if and only if not P k p + t, since p =+ t is that is incompatible with p =s q + r. In a similar way the only (set of) argument(s) we may find that (1) Pkp+q+rifPbp+qandq+r~RandnotPbp+t; (2) P b p =s q if P k p and p =+ q E R and not P /- p + s; (3) P FP; (4) P i_ p =s s if P k p and p + s E R and not P t_ p + q; (5) Pkp+tifPkpandp+t~RandnotPbp+q+r. Because the rules q + r, p + q, p =s s, and p =b t are all in R, clauses ( l)-( 5) reduce to (1) Pkp+q+rifPbp+qandnotPbp+t; (2) P b p =s q if P t_ p and not P /- p =s s; (3) P kP; (4) Pkp+sifPkpandnotPbp+q; (5) P~p+~ifP~pandnotP~p+q+r. Logically, this is equivalent to the exclusive disjunction of the following three expres- sions: (I) P/-pandP/-p+qandPf-p+q=+-r, (II) P f- p and P b p + q and P b p =s t, (III) P t- p and P k p + s and P f- p =+ t. Thus, (I) and not (II) and not (III); or (II) and not (I) and not (III); or (III) and not (II) and not (I). Which is precisely what we want. Accordingly, deg( P) = 3. The following example demonstrates a highly important feature of the theory. It shows, all other things being equal, that if the ranking in conclusive force among arguments is refined, there becomes more clarity on exactly which arguments emerge victorious. G.A.W Vreeswijk/Artificial Intelligence 90 (1997) 225-279 257 the abstract argumen- if (~1~ < 1~1+., where Example 4.32 (Complex case, with a refined order).

Hence, with this argumentation system, we have deg(P) = 2. The two examples above suggest that, if the hierarchy among arguments becomes more determined, general phenomenon. the number of extensions will decrease accordingly. This is indeed a Proposition 4.33. Let d1 = (.C, R, <I) and A2 = (C, R, 62) be abstract argumentation systems, such that <I is a refinement of &-i.e., u <I r whenever (T <2 r. Then, for every base set P, we have degl (P) < degz( P). Proof. We will show this by proving P in A2 as well. Suppose follows Further, enables more arguments verify.

We must prove that relation that we must find a defeasible entailment 25 In the literature, there is at least one alternative notion of completeness, namely that of [ 201. In Lin and Shoham’s theory, an argument structure T is complete ubout qS if either C#J E T or -4 E T. Our notion of completeness (cf. Definition 5.7) is based on ideas that are different than Lin and Shoham’s ideas on completeness. 264 GA. U? Vreeswijk/Ar@icial Intelligence 90 (1997) 225-279 b such that infob (P) = 2:. To this end, we define P f- CT if and only if u E .X We then show that this definition of k obeys the rules of Definition 4.17 as follows. First, suppose P b (+. By definition, this means u E 2. It follows that either (i) the argument u is in prem( 2); or (ii) for some arguments ~1 E 2,. . . , un E .Z we have ui, . . , , CT,, --+ u; or (iii) for some arguments 01 E z(, . . . , u, E .Z we have (~1,. . . , un +- u and _X does not contain defeaters of u. If these three cases are translated back in terms of entailment, we arrive at our desired result.

Translating all entailments in terms of membership in _Z, and using the completeness of 2, it follows that u E 2. By definition, this means that Pt--u. El A converse of this proposition holds as well: Proposition 5.11. Let P be a base set, and let 2 be an extension of P. Then 2 is a complete argument structure with prem( 2) = P. Proof. Since 2 is an extension of P, there is a relation b between P and arguments on P such that 2 = info+(P). Thus, for every argument u, we have u E 2 if and only if P /- u. Let us now prove that _Z is a complete argument structure with prem( 2) = P. There are three statements to be proved: (a) the set 2 is an argument structure, (b) the argument structure 2 is complete, and (c) we have prem( 2) = P. (a) To prove that 2 is an argument structure, we must prove that ( 1) the set Z is closed under subarguments, and that (2) the set 2 is compatible. Point (1) immediately follows from Definition 4.17. To prove (2), assume to the contrary that _Z is incompatible. By the definition of incompatibility (Definition 3.2) there must be a finite incompatible subset _Zs of 2. It can easily be verified that, without loss of generality, we may assume that all elements in & are of the form cr. Since & is finite, it has a <-least element u (cf. proposition Ul,...r 3.5). Because _ZS - {a} is a defeater of u that is in force, the argument u should according to Definition 4.17( 3) not be in force. But it is, as u E BS and 2~ C _Z, so that, after all, _Z cannot be incompatible. CT,, + (b) To prove that 2 is complete, we must prove that every argument appendable to _Z already is in 2. So let u be an argument that is appendable to _Z. In proving that u E _Z, we follow Definition 5.4. If (i) the argument u already is in 2, the argument u satisfies condition (2) or condition (3) we are done. If (ii) of the definition of appendability, then u immediately satisfies condition (2) or condition (3) of Definition 4.17, since every subset .Zs of Z simply is a set of arguments 2 that is in force. Because, in these two cases, u either satisfies condition (2) or condition (3) of Definition 4.17, u is in force, i.e., u E 2. (c) To prove that prem( 2) = P, it suffices to refer to Definition 4.17, from which it follows that every argument in _Z has its premises in P. Conditions (a), (b), and (c) together yield that .X is an argument structure. 0 G.A.

SpeciJcation of an elementary argumentation step The aim of this section is to formulate a specific elementary argumentation step (cf. structure and let u be appendable to _Z (cf.

Let ,Z be an argument Of course, we are not going a successor of .Z;, denoted by Z + U, such that the set 2 + u is an argument structure, the transition the argument (T, from 2, as much as possible will be kept, if arguments must be given up, the <-weakmost first. from 2 to _X + o is an elementary structure _Z + g contains (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) argumentation step, arguments will be given up Conditions postulates try to construct a successor argumentation (i)-(v) is inspired by a similar approach form a collection of rationality postulates.

The only reason to use “M” is that it is easily pronounceable in combination with the word successor. If this (pragmatic) reason remains unmentioned, one might suspect that the letter “M” has a deeper meaning, which is not the case. The motivation to use a letter at all, is that the notion “successor” alone has insufficient recognizability to profile itself as a special theoretical concept, with a designated function. GA.

Summary We have developed a theory of abstract argumentation that is capable of dealing with a number of important problems of defeasible reasoning.
