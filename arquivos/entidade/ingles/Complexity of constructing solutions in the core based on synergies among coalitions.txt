Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619solutions are stable in the sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new coalition. Thisconstraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game theory: the set of solutions that satisfy it is known as thecore. The computational questions around the core have received less attention. When it comes to coalition formationamong software agents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly explicit.While the driving motivation of this work is coalition formation among software agents, the computation of stablesolutions may have applications beyond automated negotiation as well, for instance in electronic commerce. As anexample, consider a large number of companies, some subsets of which could form profitable virtual organizationsthat can respond to larger or more diverse orders than the individual companies can. Determining stable value divisionsallows one to see which potential virtual organizations would be viable in the sense that the companies in the virtualorganization would naturally stay together. As another example, consider a future online service that determines howmuch each employee of a company should be paid so that the company does not collapse as a result of employeesbeing bought away by other companies. The input to this service would be how much subsets of the company’semployees would be paid if they left collectively (for instance, a whole department could be bought away). Thisinput could come from salary databases or a manager’s estimate. The computational problem of determining a stablerenumeration would be crucial for such a service. Both of these example problems fit exactly under the model that westudy in this paper.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the required concepts from cooperativegame theory. In Section 3, we define a concise general representation for games in characteristic form that relies onsuperadditivity, and show that it allows for efficient (relative to the size of the representation) checking of whethera given outcome is in the core. In Section 4, we show that determining whether the core is nonempty is NP-completeboth with and without transferable utility. In Section 5, we demonstrate that what makes the problem hard in bothcases is determining the collaborative possibilities (the set of outcomes possible for the grand coalition); we do so byshowing that if these are given, the problem becomes solvable in time polynomial in the size of the representation inboth cases. In Section 6, we show that for a hybrid version of the problem, where utility transfer is possible only withinthe grand coalition, the problem remains NP-complete even when the collaborative possibilities are given. Finally, inSection 7, we show that if the characteristic function is convex, a solution in the core can be constructed efficiently(in O(nl2) time, where n is the number of agents and l is the number of synergies), even when the collaborativepossibilities are not given in advance.2. Definitions from cooperative game theoryIn this section we review standard definitions from cooperative game theory, which we will use throughout thepaper. In the definitions, we follow Mas-Colell et al. [21].In general, how well agents in a coalition do may depend on what nonmembers of the coalition do (for example,see [2,6,10,22–24,28]). However, in cooperative game theory, coalition formation is usually studied in the contextof characteristic function games where the utilities of the coalition members do not depend on the nonmembers’actions [5,16,31,35–37]. (One way to interpret this is to consider the coalition members’ utilities to be the utilitiesthey can guarantee themselves no matter what the nonmembers do [1].)Definition 1. Given a set of agents A, a utility possibility vector uB for B = {b1, . . . , bnB(ub1 , . . . , ubnBA utility possibility set is a set of utility possibility vectors for a given set B.} ⊆ A is a vector) representing utilities that the agents in B can guarantee themselves by cooperating with each other.Definition 2. A game in characteristic form consists of a set of agents A and a utility possibility set V (B) for eachB ⊆ A.Sometimes games in characteristic form have transferable utility, which means agents in a coalition can transferutility among themselves. (Usually, this is done using monetary transfers.)Definition 3. A game in characteristic form is said to have transferable utility if for every B ⊆ A there is a numberv(B) (the value of B) such that V (B) = {uB = (uBb1(cid:1) v(B)}.b∈B uBb, . . . , uB(cid:1)):bnBV. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619609It is commonly assumed that the joining of two coalitions does not prevent them from acting as well as theycould have acted separately. In other words, the composite coalition can coordinate by choosing not to coordinate.This assumption is known as superadditivity. When superadditivity holds, it is always best for the grand coalition ofall agents to form.1 We will assume superadditivity throughout the paper. This makes our hardness results strongerbecause even a restricted version of the problem is hard.Definition 4. A game in characteristic form is said to be superadditive if, for any two disjoint subsets B, C ⊆ A,and for any uB ∈ V (B) and uC ∈ V (C), we have (uB , uC) ∈ V (B ∪ C). (In the case of transferable utility, this isequivalent to saying that for any B, C ⊆ A with B and C disjoint, v(B ∪ C) (cid:2) v(B) + v(C).)We now need a solution concept. In this paper, we study only what is arguably the best known solution concept,namely the core (see, for example, [16,21,35]). It was first introduced by Gillies [13]. An outcome is said to be in thecore if there is no subset of agents that can break off and form their own coalition in such a way that all of the agentsin that coalition are better off. The following definition makes this precise., . . . , uBDefinition 5. An outcome uA = (uA(uBb1) ∈ V (B) such that for all b ∈ B, uBsaying that the outcome is blocked by B if v(B) >coalition.1 , . . . , uAbnBn ) ∈ V (A) is blocked by coalition B ⊆ A if there exists uB =b . (In the case of transferable utility, this is equivalent tob∈B uAb .) An outcome is in the core if it is blocked by nob > uA(cid:1)In general, the core can be empty. If the core is empty, the game is inherently unstable because no matter whatoutcome is chosen, some subset of agents is motivated to pull out and form their own coalition. In other words,requiring that no subset of agents is motivated to break off into a coalition of its own overconstrains the system.An example of a game with an empty core is the one with agents {x, y, z}, where we have the utility possibility vectorsu{x,y} = (2, 1), u{y,z} = (2, 1), and u{x,z} = (1, 2) (and the ones that can be derived from this through superadditivity).The same example with transferable utility also has an empty core.In the rest of this paper, we will study the question of how complex it is to determine whether the core is nonempty,that is, whether there is a solution or the problem is overconstrained. First, as a basis for comparison, we mentionthe following straightforward, general algorithms for checking whether there exists a solution in the core. For a gamewithout transferable utility, for every element uA ∈ V (A), check, for every coalition B ⊆ A, whether there existsan element uB ∈ V (B) such that uB blocks uA. For a game with transferable utility, we can use linear programming:we must decide on each agent’s utility ui in such a way that the total utility does not exceed v(A), and such that forevery coalition B ⊆ A, v(B) does not exceed the total utility of the agents in B [25]. There are at least two reasonswhy these algorithms are not always practical. First, both algorithms are exponential in the number of agents, becausethey require a check or constraint for every subset of the agents.2 Second, the first algorithm requires the computationof every utility possibility vector, and the second algorithm requires the computation of every value of a coalition. Thecomputation of a single utility possibility vector or coalition value is not necessarily trivial, because it may requirethat the agents solve a complex collaborative planning problem.Both of these two problems are intimately related to the representation of the characteristic form game. We cannothope to compute solutions in the core in time that is less than exponential in the number of agents unless the represen-tation is concise (that is, it does not simply list all the utility possibility vectors or all the coalition values). Moreover,we cannot address the question of how hard it is to compute individual utility possibility vectors or coalition values1 On the other hand, without superadditivity, even finding the optimal coalition structure (partition of agents into coalitions) can be hard [18,19,29,32,33]. A third potential source of computational complexity (in addition to payoff/utility division as studied in this paper, and coalition structuregeneration) stems from each potential coalition having to solve a hard optimization problem in order to determine the value of the coalition. Forexample, when the agents are carrier companies with their own trucks and delivery tasks, they can save costs by forming a coalition (poolingtheir trucks and tasks), but each potential coalition faces a hard optimization problem: a vehicle routing problem defined by the coalition’s trucksand tasks. The effect of such hard optimization problems on coalition formation has been studied by Sandholm and Lesser [30] and Tohmé andSandholm [34].2 In the case of the first algorithm, there may also be exponentially or even infinitely many utility possibility vectors per coalition, making thealgorithm even less satisfactory.610V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619unless we know the representation from which they must be derived.3 Because of this, in the next section, we introducea concise representation of characteristic form games that is based on the synergies among coalitions.3. Representing characteristic form games conciselyIn our representation of games in characteristic form, we distinguish between games without transferable utility,where we specify some utility possibility vectors for some coalitions, and games with transferable utility, where wespecify the values of some coalitions.If the representation of the game specifies V (B) or v(B) explicitly for each coalition B ⊆ A, then the length ofthe representation is exponential in the number of agents. In that case, any algorithm for evaluating nonemptiness ofthe core (as long as it reads all the input) requires time exponential in the number of agents. However, that runtime ispolynomial in the size of the input (this can be accomplished, for example, using the algorithms that we introduce inSection 5).Most characteristic form games that represent real-world settings have some special structure. This usually allowsfor a game representation that is significantly more concise. The complexity of characterizing the core has alreadybeen studied in certain specific concisely expressible families of games. For example, Deng and Papadimitriou [9]study a game in which the agents are vertices of a graph with weights on the edges, and the value of a coalition isdetermined by the total weight of the edges contained in the subgraph induced by that coalition. Faigle et al. [12]study a game in which the agents are vertices on a graph, and the cost of a coalition is the weight of a minimumspanning tree for the subgraph induced by that coalition. They show that determining whether a solution is in the coreis NP-complete in this game. In other work [11], the same authors study a modification of this game where the cost ofa coalition is the minimum length of a traveling salesman tour for the subgraph induced by that coalition, and showhow to use linear programming to give a solution that is approximately in the core (in the sense that every coalitionpays at most 4/3 times their own cost). Markakis and Saberi [20] study how to construct a solution in the core fora multicommodity flow game on graphs (defined by Papadimitriou [27]). In this game, the agents correspond to thevertices of the graph, and each agent’s utility is the total flow originated or terminated at that agent’s vertex. A coalitioncan obtain any utility vector corresponding to a feasible flow for the subgraph induced by that coalition. Markakis andSaberi show that the core is always nonempty in such games, and they show that for the case of transferable utility,a solution in the core can be constructed in polynomial time in such games. Goemans and Skutella [14] study how toconstruct a solution in the core for a facility location game. In this game, several facilities must be opened (at a cost),and the agents must be connected to them (at a cost). Here, a solution is in the core if no subset of agents has anincentive to deviate and build the facilities and connections on their own. Goemans and Skutella show that there isa solution in the core if and only if there is no integrality gap for a particular linear programming relaxation (whichis NP-complete to verify). Pal and Tardos [26] and Gupta et al. [15] study a game in which the agents need to beconnected to a common source in a graph, and give a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a solution that isapproximately in the core. Finally, Deng et al. [8] study an integer programming formulation which captures manygames on graphs, and (as in the result by Goemans and Skutella [14]) show that the core is nonempty if and onlyif the linear programming relaxation has an integer optimal solution. All of those results depend on concise gamerepresentations which are specific to the game families under study. Typically, such a family of games is played ona combinatorial structure such as a graph. Cooperative games on combinatorial structures have been systematicallystudied [3].As a point of deviation, we study a natural representation that can capture any characteristic form game.4 Concise-ness in our representation stems only from the fact that in many settings, the synergies among coalitions are sparse.When a coalition introduces no new synergy, its utility possibility vectors can be derived using superadditivity. There-fore, the input needs to include only the utility possibility vectors of coalitions that introduce synergy. The definitionsbelow make this precise. We first present our representation of games without transferable utility.3 It should be remarked that deriving utility possibility vectors or coalition values from a given representation may be only part of the problem:it is possible that this representation itself must be constructed from another, even more basic representation, and this construction may itself becomputationally nontrivial.4 Our hardness results are not implied by the earlier hardness results for specific game families, because the games must be concisely representablein our input language to prove our hardness results.V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619611Definition 6. We represent a game in characteristic form without transferable utility by a set of agents A, anda set of utility possibility vectors W = {(B, uB,k)}. (Here there may be multiple vectors for the same B, distin-guished by different k indices.) The utility possibility set for a given B ⊆ A is then given by V (B) = {uB : uB =1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r Bi = B, all the Bi are disjoint, and for all the Bi, (Bi, uBi ) ∈ W }. To avoid senseless cases(uB1 , . . . , uBr ),that have no outcomes, we also require that ({a}, (0)) ∈ W for all a ∈ A.5(cid:2)Listing all the utility possibility vectors is of course not always feasible, and when it is not feasible, anotherrepresentation should be used. For example, in a game with transferable utility, there are infinitely many (actually,a continuum of) utility possibility vectors. Therefore, we give a more appropriate representation of games with trans-ferable utility below. Nevertheless, there do exist settings in which all the utility possibility vectors can be listedexplicitly. For example, we may have historical data on which coalitions have formed in the past and what the agents’utilities were in those coalitions. At the minimum, we should ensure that no subcoalition will collectively yearn fortimes past (and perhaps seek to recreate them by breaking off from the present-day coalition). In this case, we shouldtry to find a solution that is in the core of the game given by the historical characteristic function.We now present our representation of games with transferable utility.Definition 7. We represent a game in characteristic form with transferable utility by a set of agents A, and a set of1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r Bi = B,values W = {(B, v(B))}. The value for a given B ⊆ A is then given by v(B) = max{all the Bi are disjoint, and for all the Bi, (Bi, v(Bi)) ∈ W }. To avoid senseless cases that have no outcomes, we alsorequire that ({a}, 0) ∈ W whenever {a} does not receive a value elsewhere in W .1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r v(Bi):(cid:1)(cid:2)Thus, we only need to specify a basis of utility possibilities, from which we can then derive the others. (Thisderivation can, however, be computationally hard, as we will discuss shortly.) This representation integrates rathernicely with real-world problems where determining any coalition’s value is complex. For example, in the multiagentvehicle routing problem, we solve the routing problem for every coalition that might introduce new synergies. Whenit is clear that there is no synergy between two coalitions (for example, if they operate in different cities and each oneonly has deliveries within its city), there is no need to solve the routing problem of the coalition that would result ifthe two coalitions were to merge.The following lemmas indicate that we can also use this representation effectively for checking whether an outcomeis in the core, that is, whether it satisfies the strategic constraints.Lemma 1. Without transferable utility, an outcome uA = (uAonly if it is blocked by some coalition B through some utility vector uB , where (B, uB ) ∈ W .1 , . . . , uAn ) ∈ V (A) is blocked by some coalition if andProof. The “if” part is trivial. For “only if”, suppose uA is blocked by coalition C through some uC , so that for everyc ∈ C, uCc . We know uC = (uC1 , . . . , uCr ) where (Ci, uCi ) ∈ W . But then, C1 blocks uA through uC1 . (cid:1)c > uAThe proof for the same lemma in the case of transferable utility is only slightly more intricate.Lemma 2. With transferable utility, an outcome uA = (uAif it is blocked by some coalition B through its value v(B), where (B, v(B)) ∈ W .1 , . . . , uAn ) ∈ V (A) is blocked by some coalition if and only(cid:1)(cid:1)Proof. The “if” part is trivial. For “only if”, suppose uA is blocked by coalition C through v(C), so that1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r v(Ci) >v(C) >(cid:1)c . But then Ci blocks uA through v(Ci).uA(cid:1)c . We know that v(C) =c∈C uAuAc , and hence for at least one Ci , we have v(Ci) >c∈Ci1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r v(Ci) where (Ci, v(Ci)) ∈ W . It follows thatc∈Ci1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)One drawback is that under this representation, it is, in general, NP-complete to compute a given coalition’s value.Thus, the representation still leaves part of the collaborative optimization problem of determining a coalition’s value to5 Setting the utility to 0 in this case is without loss of generality, as we can simply normalize the utility function to obtain this.612V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619be solved (which is not entirely unnatural given that in many practical settings, the collaborative optimization problemis very complex). Rather than prove this NP-hardness here directly, we note that it follows from results in the comingsections, as we will show.4. Checking whether the core is nonempty is hardWe now show that with this representation, it is hard to check whether the core is nonempty. This holds both forthe nontransferable utility setting and for the transferable utility setting.Definition 8 (CORE-NONEMPTY). We are given a superadditive game in characteristic form (with or without trans-ferable utility) in our representation language. We are asked whether the core is nonempty.We will demonstrate NP-hardness of this problem by reducing from the NP-complete EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS problem [17].Definition 9 (EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS). We are given a set S of size 3m and a collection of subsets {Si}1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r of S,each of size 3. We are asked if there is a cover of S consisting of m of the subsets.The intuition behind both NP-hardness reductions from EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS presented in this section isthe following. We let the elements of S correspond to some of the agents, and we let the subsets Si correspond tosome of the elements of W , in such a way that the grand coalition can achieve a “good” outcome if and only if we cancover all these agents with a subset of disjoint elements of W —that is, if and only if an exact cover exists. Then, weadd some additional agents and elements of W such that only such a good outcome would be strategically stable (thisis the nontrivial part of both proofs, which is why these results do not follow trivially from the hardness of solvinga coalition’s collaborative optimization problem). The formal proofs follow.Theorem 1. CORE-NONEMPTY without transferable utility is NP-complete.Proof. To show that the problem is in NP, nondeterministically choose a subset of W , and check if the correspondingcoalitions constitute a partition of A. If so, check if the outcome corresponding to this partition is blocked by anyelement of W .To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS instance to the following CORE-NONEMPTY instance. Let the set of agents be A = S ∪ {w, x, y, z}. For each Si , let (Si, uSi ) be an elementof W , with uSi = (2, 2, 2). Also, for each s ∈ S, let ({s, w}, u{s,w}) be an element of W , with u{s,w} = (1, 4).Also, let ({w, x, y, z}, u{w,x,y,z}) be an element of W , with u{w,x,y,z} = (3, 3, 3, 3). Finally, let ({x, y}, u{x,y}) withu{x,y} = (2, 1), ({y, z}, u{y,z}) with u{y,z} = (2, 1), ({x, z}, u{x,z}) with u{x,z} = (1, 2) be elements of W . The onlyother elements of W are the required ones giving utility 0 to singleton coalitions. We claim the two instances areequivalent.First suppose there is an exact cover by 3-sets consisting of Sc1, . . . , Scm . Then the following outcome is possi-ble: (uSc1 , . . . , uScm , u{w,x,y,z}) = (2, 2, . . . , 2, 3, 3, 3, 3). It is easy to verify that this outcome is not blocked by anycoalition. It follows that the core is nonempty.Now suppose there is no exact cover by 3-sets. Suppose the core is nonempty, that is, it contains some outcomeuA = (uC1 , . . . , uCr ) with each (Ci, uCi ) an element of W , and the Ci disjoint. Then one of the Ci must be {s, w} forsome s ∈ S: for if this were not the case, there must be some s ∈ S with uA= 0, because the Ci that are equal to Siscannot cover S; but then {s, w} would block the outcome. Thus, none of the Ci can be equal to {w, x, y, z}. Then oneof the Ci must be one of {x, y}, {y, z}, {x, z}, or else two of {x, y, z} would block the outcome. By symmetry, we canwithout loss of generality assume it is {x, y}. But then {y, z} will block the outcome. (Contradiction.) It follows thatthe core is empty. (cid:1)We might hope that the convexity introduced by transferable utility makes the problem tractable through, forexample, linear programming. This turns out not to be the case.V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619613Theorem 2. CORE-NONEMPTY with transferable utility is NP-complete.Proof. To show that the problem is in NP, nondeterministically choose a subset of W , and check if the correspondingcoalitions constitute a partition of A. If so, nondeterministically divide the sum of the coalitions’ values over theagents, and check if this outcome is blocked by any element of W .To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS instance to the following CORE-NONEMPTY instance. Let the set of agents be A = S ∪ {x, y}. For each Si , let (Si, 3) be an element of W .Additionally, let (S ∪ {x}, 6m), (S ∪ {y}, 6m), and ({x, y}, 6m) be elements of W . The only other elements of Ware the required ones giving value 0 to singleton coalitions. We claim the two instances are equivalent.(cid:1)First suppose there is an exact cover by 3-sets consisting of Sc1, . . . , Scm . Then the value of coalition S is at least1(cid:1)i(cid:1)m v(Sci ) = 3m. Combining this with the coalition {x, y}, which has value 6m, we conclude that the grandcoalition A has value at least 9m. Hence, the outcome (1, 1, . . . , 1, 3m, 3m) is possible. It is easy to verify that thisoutcome is not blocked by any coalition. It follows that the core is nonempty.Now suppose there is no exact cover by 3-sets. Then the coalition S has value less than 3m (since there are no mdisjoint Si ), and as a result the value of the grand coalition is less than 9m. It follows that in any outcome, the totalutility of at least one of S ∪ {x}, S ∪ {y}, and {x, y} is less than 6m. Hence, this coalition will block. It follows thatthe core is empty. (cid:1)Our results imply that in the general case, it is computationally hard to make any strategic assessment of a game incharacteristic form when it is concisely represented.5. Specifying information about the grand coalition makes the problem tractableOur proofs that CORE-NONEMPTY is hard relied on constructing instances where it is difficult to determine whatthe grand coalition can accomplish. In effect, the hardness derived from the fact that even collaborative optimization ishard in these instances. While this is indeed a real difficulty that occurs in the analysis of characteristic form games, wemay nevertheless wonder to what extent computational complexity issues are introduced by the purely strategic aspectof the games. To analyze this, we investigate the computational complexity of CORE-NONEMPTY when V (A) (orv(A)) is explicitly provided as input, so that determining what the grand coalition can accomplish can no longer bethe source of any complexity.6 It indeed turns out that the problem becomes easy both with and without transferableutility.Theorem 3. When V (A) is explicitly provided, CORE-NONEMPTY without transferable utility is in P.Proof. The following simple algorithm accomplishes this efficiently. For each element of V (A), check whether it isblocked by any element of W . The algorithm is correct due to Lemma 1. (cid:1)For the transferable utility case, we make use of linear programming.Theorem 4. When v(A) is explicitly provided, CORE-NONEMPTY with transferable utility is in P.Proof. We decide how to allocate the v(A) among the agents by solving a linear program. Because of Lemma 2, thecore is nonempty if and only if the following linear program has a solution:(cid:5)(cid:4)B, v(B)∈ W,(cid:3)(cid:3)ub (cid:2) v(B).ui (cid:1) v(A);(1)∀1(cid:1)i(cid:1)nb∈BBecause the size of the program is polynomial, this constitutes a polynomial-time algorithm. (cid:1)6 Bilbao et al. [4] have studied the complexity of the core in characteristic form games with transferable utility when there is an oracle that canprovide the value v(B) of any coalition B. Our amended input corresponds to asking one such query in addition to obtaining the unamended input.614V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619The algorithms in the proofs also construct a solution that is in the core, if the core is nonempty. We note that wehave now also established that computing v(A) is NP-hard, because, apart from the computation of v(A), we have anefficient algorithm for computing a solution in the core—which we have already shown is NP-hard.6. Games with limited utility transfer remain hardNot all complexity issues disappear through having the collaborative optimization problem solution available. Itturns out that if we allow for games with limited utility transfer, where only some coalitions can transfer utilityamong themselves, the hardness returns. In particular, we show hardness in the case where only the grand coalitioncan transfer utility. This is a natural model for example in settings where there is a market institution that enforcespayments, but if a subset of the agents breaks off, the institution collapses and payments cannot be enforced. Anotherexample application is the setting described in Section 3 in which we wish to ensure that there is no subcoalition suchthat all of its agents were happier in a past time period when they formed a coalition by themselves.Definition 10. We represent a game in characteristic form in which only the grand coalition can transfer utility bya set of agents A, a set of utility possibility vectors W = {(B, uB,k)}, and a value v(A) for the grand coalition. Theutility possibility set for a given B ⊆ A, B (cid:6)= A is then given by V (B) = {uB : uB = (uB1 , . . . , uBr ),1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r Bi = B,all the Bi are disjoint, and for all the Bi, (Bi, uBi ) ∈ W }. To avoid senseless cases that have no outcomes, we alsorequire that ({a}, (0)) ∈ W for all a ∈ A. For the grand coalition A, any vector of utilities that sum to at most v(A) ispossible.(cid:2)We demonstrate that the CORE-NONEMPTY problem is NP-hard in this setting by reducing from the NP-completeVERTEX-COVER problem [17].Definition 11 (VERTEX-COVER). We are given a graph G = (V , E), and a number k. We are asked whether there isa subset of V of size k such that each edge has at least one of its endpoints in the subset.We are now ready to state our result.Theorem 5. When only the grand coalition can transfer utility, CORE-NONEMPTY is NP-complete (even when v(A)is explicitly provided as input).Proof. To show that the problem is in NP, nondeterministically divide v(A) over the agents, and check if this outcomeis blocked by any element of W .To show NP-hardness, we reduce an arbitrary VERTEX-COVER instance to the following CORE-NONEMPTYinstance. Let A = V ∪ {x, y, z}, and let v(A) = 6|V | + k. Furthermore, for each edge (vi, vj ), let ({vi, vj }, u{vi ,vj })be an element of W , with u{vi ,vj } = (1, 1). Finally, for any a, b ∈ {x, y, z} (a (cid:6)= b), let ({a, b}, u{a,b}) be an elementof W , with u{a,b} = (3|V |, 2|V |). The only other elements of W are the required ones giving utility 0 to singletoncoalitions. This game does not violate the superadditivity assumption, since without the explicit specification of v(A),superadditivity can at most imply that v(A) = 6|V | (cid:1) 6|V | + k. We claim the two instances are equivalent.First suppose there is a vertex cover of size k. Consider the following outcome: all the vertices in the vertex coverreceive utility 1, all the other vertices receive utility 0, and each of x, y, and z receives utility 2|V |. Using the fact thatall the edges are covered, it is easy to verify that this outcome is not blocked by any coalition. It follows that the coreis nonempty.Now suppose there is some outcome uA in the core. In such an outcome, either each of {x, y, z} receives atleast 2|V |, or two of them receive at least 3|V | each. (For if not, there is some a ∈ {x, y, z} with uAa < 2|V | andb < 3|V |, and the coalition {b, a} will block through u{b,a} = (3|V |, 2|V |).) It fol-some b ∈ {x, y, z} (b (cid:6)= a) with uAlows that the combined utility of all the elements of V is at most k. Now, for each edge (vi, vj ), at least one of itsvertices must receive utility at least 1, or this edge would block. Thus, the vertices that receive at least 1 cover theedges. But because the combined utility of all the elements of V is at most k, there can be at most k such vertices.It follows that there is a vertex cover. (cid:1)V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619615Games in which only some coalitions can transfer utility are quite likely to appear in real-world multiagent settings,for example because only some of the agents use a currency. Our result shows that for such games, even when thecollaborative optimization problem has already been solved, it can be computationally hard to strategically assess thegame.7. A fast algorithm for convex characteristic functionsWhile we have shown that constructing a solution in the core is hard in general, we may wonder whether restrictionson the characteristic function make the problem easier. In this section, we show that if the characteristic function isconvex (in which case it is known that the core is always nonempty), a solution in the core can be constructed efficiently(in O(nl2) time, where n is the number of agents and l is the number of synergies) under our representation. We donot require that the value of the grand coalition is known, nor do we need to use techniques from linear programming.We will restrict our attention to games with transferable utility in this section. A characteristic function v is convexif for any coalitions B and C, we have v(B ∪ C) − v(C) (cid:2) v(B) − v(B ∩ C) [25]. That is, the marginal contributionof a subcoalition to a larger set is always larger (or at least as large). One natural setting in which the characteristicfunction is convex is the following. Suppose that every agent i has a set of skills Si , and suppose that every agent’sskills are unique, that is, Si ∩ Sj = {} for all i (cid:6)= j . Furthermore, suppose that there is a set of tasks T that theagents can accomplish, and that each task t ∈ T has a value v(t) (cid:2) 0, as well as a set of skills S(t) that are requiredto accomplish t. Then, the value of a coalition B is the sum of the values of the tasks that they can accomplish,that is, v(B) =v(t). In this setting, the marginal set of tasks that can be accomplished by addinga given subset of the agents to an existing coalition of agents is increasing in the existing coalition (as the existingcoalition gets larger, the marginal set of tasks that can be accomplished by adding the given subset of agents can getno smaller), and therefore the characteristic function is convex. One example application is the following: supposeeach agent holds some medical patents (these are the agents’ “skills”), and there is a set of drugs (the “tasks”), eachof which has a market value and requires a subset of the patents to be manufactured.t∈T : S(t)⊆i∈B Si(cid:1)(cid:2)When the characteristic function is convex, one method of constructing a solution in the core is the following:impose an arbitrary order on the agents, add them to the coalition one at a time, and give each agent its marginalvalue (see, for example, Osborne and Rubinstein [25]). Unfortunately, this scheme cannot be applied directly underour representation, as it requires knowing the values of the relevant coalitions. As we have seen earlier, computingthese values is hard for general characteristic functions. However, in this section we will show that when convexityholds, this is no longer the case, and solutions in the core can be constructed efficiently.As it turns out, it is easier to think about the implications of convexity for our representation if we first assume thatthere are no explicitly specified pairs (B, v(B)) that are redundant. That is, if v(B) could have been inferred from thevalues of other coalitions by superadditivity, we assume that it is not explicitly specified. Thus, only the synergeticcoalitions’ values are explicitly specified, where a coalition is synergetic if its value could not have been derived fromthe values of its proper subcoalitions. We will later show how to remove this assumption. Formally:Definition 12. A coalition B is synergetic if v(B) > max{of B, all the Bi are disjoint, and for all the Bi, (Bi, v(Bi)) ∈ W }.1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r v(Bi):(cid:1)(cid:2)1(cid:1)i(cid:1)r Bi = B, each Bi is a proper subsetFirst we show that the union of two intersecting synergetic coalitions must be synergetic when convexity holds.Lemma 3. Let v be a convex characteristic function. Suppose B and C are both synergetic coalitions (for v), witha nonempty intersection (B ∩ C (cid:6)= {}). Then B ∪ C is a synergetic coalition.Proof. If one of B and C is contained in the other, the lemma is trivially true. Hence, we can assume that this is notthe case, that is, B − C (cid:6)= {} and C − B (cid:6)= {}.First suppose that v(B ∪ C) = v(B) + v(C − B). Then, v(B ∪ C) − v(C) = v(B) + v(C − B) − v(C) < v(B) +v(C − B) − v(C − B) − v(B ∩ C) = v(B) − v(B ∩ C) (where the inequality follows from C being a synergeticcoalition), contradicting convexity. Hence, v(B ∪ C) > v(B) + v(C − B). By symmetry, v(B ∪ C) > v(C) + v(B − C).We will now prove the lemma by induction on |B ∪ C|. For |B ∪ C| (cid:1) 2 the lemma is vacuously true. Now supposethat it is always true for |B ∪ C| < k, but it fails for |B ∪ C| = k. That is, we have some B and C (both synergetic,616V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619with a nonempty intersection and neither contained in the other), where B ∪ C is not synergetic. Without loss ofgenerality, we assume that B is maximal, that is, there is no strict superset of B in B ∪ C that is also synergetic. LetnD1, D2, . . . , Dn be a partition of B ∪ C (with n > 1) such that each Di is synergetic andi=1 v(Di) = v(B ∪ C) (sucha partition must exist because we are supposing B ∪ C is not synergetic). If one of the Di were equal to either B or C,then we would have v(B ∪ C) = v(B) + v(C − B) or v(B ∪ C) = v(C) + v(B − C), which we showed impossibleat the beginning of the proof. Moreover, it is not possible that all the Di are either contained in B, or have an emptyintersection with B. For if this were the case, then v(B ∪ C) =Di ⊆C−B v(Di) <Di ⊆C−B v(Di) (cid:1) v(B ∪ C) (where the first inequality derives from the facts that B is synergetic and nov(B) +Di is equal to B). Thus, there is some D∗∩ B (cid:6)= {} and D∗i doesito conclude that B ∪ D∗not contain all of C − B. Then, we can apply the induction assumption to B and D∗isiisynergetic. But this contradicts the maximality of B. On the other hand, suppose that D∗i does contain all of C − B.Then B ∪ D∗i ), which we showed impossible at the beginning of theiproof. (cid:1)∩ (C − B) (cid:6)= {}. Suppose that this D∗= B ∪ C, and v(B ∪ D∗(cid:1)ni=1 v(Di) =i ) + v(B − D∗Di ⊆B v(Di) +i with D∗i ) = v(D∗(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)iNext, we show that any partition of B into maximal synergetic coalitions will give us the value of B when convexityholds.Lemma 4. If v is convex, for any coalition B, for any partition D1, D2, . . . , Dn of B where each Di is synergetic andmaximal in B (there is no superset of Di in B which is also synergetic), v(B) =(cid:1)ni=1 v(Di).mj =1 v(Ej ) = v(B).Proof. Suppose not. Let E1, E2, . . . , Em be a partition of B where each Ej is synergetic andNo Ej can be a strict superset of a Di , because the Di are maximal. Also, it cannot be the case that every Ej ismmj =1 v(Ej ). It follows thatj =1 v(Ej ) <a subset of some Di , because then we would havethere is some E∗∪ E∗jmust be synergetic, contradicting that D∗j that is not contained in any Di . Some D∗i is maximal. (cid:1)j . But then by Lemma 3, D∗i must intersect with E∗ni=1 v(Di) < v(B) =(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)i(cid:1)We now show how to quickly compute the value of any coalition when convexity holds, presuming that there are noredundant specifications of coalition values. (That is, all the coalitions with explicitly specified values are synergetic.We will show how to remove this assumption shortly.)Lemma 5. Suppose v is convex. For any coalition B, if all its subcoalitions D ⊆ B for which v(D) is explicitlyspecified are synergetic (that is, there are no redundant specifications), the explicitly specified (D, v(D)) pairs aresorted by |D|, and each subset D is represented as a sorted list of agents, then v(B) can be computed in O(nl) timeby computing a partition of maximal synergetic subcoalitions. (Here, n is the number of agents and l is the number ofexplicitly specified (D, v(D)) pairs.)Proof. Because all synergetic subcoalitions must be explicitly specified, we know that the set of subcoalitions D forwhich (D, v(D)) is explicitly specified is exactly the set of synergetic subcoalitions. Thus, by Lemma 4, we merelyneed to find a partition of B consisting of maximal subcoalitions whose value is explicitly specified. To do so, we willadd such maximal subcoalitions to our partition one at a time. Because the explicitly specified (D, v(D)) pairs aresorted by |D|, we can read through them starting with those with the highest |D| and work our way downwards to theones with smallest |D|. When we arrive at any given D, we add it to the partition if and only if no members of D werepreviously added to the partition (as a member of another subcoalition). (We can perform each such check in O(n)time, by keeping track of the set of agents that have already been added to the partition as a sorted list. To see if this setintersects with D, which is also stored as a sorted list, we go through the two sorted lists in parallel (as in, for instance,the well-known MergeSort algorithm), which requires O(n) time. Updating the list of all agents that have alreadybeen added to a coalition when a given set D is added to the partition can be done in O(n) time as well, again goingthrough the two lists in parallel, and merging them.) Every synergetic D that we add to the partition must be maximal:for, if D is not maximal, when we arrive at D, the maximal synergetic D(cid:8) containing it must already have been added,for the following reason. By Lemma 3 a maximal synergetic D(cid:8) cannot intersect with another synergetic subcoalitionof equal or larger size. Hence none of the members of D(cid:8) were already in some element of the partition when wewere considering adding D(cid:8), and thus we must have added D(cid:8). Moreover, by the same reasoning, any member of BV. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619617must eventually be in some element of the partition (because the maximal synergetic subcoalition containing it mustbe added). Thus we will get a valid partition. (cid:1)Of course, for generality, we would like to allow for redundant specifications. Next, we show that we can indeedallow for them, because we can quickly remove any redundant specifications when convexity holds.Lemma 6. If v is convex and each subset B ⊆ A is represented as a sorted list of agents, then the set of explicitlyspecified (B, v(B)) pairs can be reduced to the subset of only the synergetic ones in O(nl2) time. (Here, n is thenumber of agents and l is the number of explicitly specified (B, v(B)) pairs.)Proof. After sorting the (B, v(B)) pairs by |B| (which takes O(l log(l)) time), we will go through them starting atthose with the smallest |B| and working our way up to the larger ones, eliminating each nonsynergetic one, as follows.We observe that when we arrive at the pair (B, v(B)), all the remaining explicitly specified (D, v(D)) with D ⊆ B willbe synergetic (apart from possibly B itself). Thus, we can temporarily remove (B, v(B)), then according to Lemma 5compute the new value of B (say, v(cid:8)(B)) in O(nl) time, and remove the pair (B, v(B)) if and only if v(cid:8)(B) = v(B).(We observe that, if B is indeed synergetic, removing the pair (B, v(B)) may break the convexity, in which casethe algorithm from Lemma 5 may select the wrong maximal subcoalitions and compute too small a value for v(cid:8)(B).Of course, in this case the computed v(cid:8)(B) is still smaller than v(B) and we will not remove the pair (B, v(B)), asrequired.) (cid:1)Finally, we show how to quickly compute a solution in the core when convexity holds. To distribute the value, wemake use of the following known lemma mentioned at the beginning of this section.Lemma 7. (Osborne and Rubinstein [25].) For any order imposed on the agents, if we add the agents to the coalitionone at a time, and give each agent its marginal value, then, if the characteristic function is convex, we obtain a solutionin the core.This leads to the following result.Theorem 6. If v is convex, a solution in the core can be constructed in O(nl2) time. (Here, n is the number of agentsand l is the number of explicitly specified (B, v(B)) pairs.)Proof. If the subsets B ⊆ A are not yet represented as sorted lists, we can correct this in O(nl log(n)) time. Then,we remove all the redundant (B, v(B)) pairs using Lemma 6, and sort the remaining ones by |B|, in O(nl2) time.Then (using the scheme from Lemma 7) we order the members of the grand coalition in an arbitrary way, add them inone by one, and give each of them their marginal value. This requires the computation of the value of one additionalcoalition for each agent (namely, the coalition that results from adding that agent), which takes O(nl) time per agentusing Lemma 5, for a total of O(n2l) time. Because every agent appears in at least one synergetic subcoalition, andhence n (cid:1) l, the whole algorithm runs in O(nl2) time. (cid:1)Another polynomial-time approach for constructing a solution in the core that does not rely on Lemma 7 is tocompute the value of the grand coalition (using Lemmas 6 and 5), and then solve the linear programming problem asin Section 5.8. Conclusions and future researchAs we have argued, coalition formation is a key problem in automated negotiation among self-interested agents,and other multiagent applications. A coalition of agents can sometimes accomplish things that the individual agentscannot, or can accomplish them more efficiently. Motivating the agents to abide by a solution requires careful analysis:only some of the solutions are stable in the sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a newcoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game theory, but the computational questions618V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 607–619around this constraint have received less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software agents (thatrepresent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly explicit.In this paper we defined a concise general representation for games in characteristic form that relies on superaddi-tivity, and showed that it allows for efficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core. We then showed thatdetermining whether the core is nonempty is NP-complete both with and without transferable utility. We demonstratedthat what makes the problem hard in both cases is determining the collaborative possibilities (the set of outcomes pos-sible for the grand coalition); we did so by showing that if these are given, the problem becomes solvable in timepolynomial in the size of the representation in both cases. However, we then demonstrated that for a hybrid versionof the problem, where utility transfer is possible only within the grand coalition, the problem remains NP-completeeven when the collaborative possibilities are given. Finally, we showed that if the characteristic function is convex,a solution in the core can be constructed efficiently (in O(nl2) time, where n is the number of agents and l is thenumber of synergies), even when the collaborative possibilities are not given in advance.Future research can take a number of different directions. One such direction is to investigate restricted families ofgames in characteristic form (such as the family of convex games, which we analyzed in this paper). Another directionis to evaluate other solution concepts in cooperative game theory from the perspective of computational complexityunder our input representation. A long-term goal is to extend the framework for finding a strategically stable solutionto take into account issues of computational complexity in determining the synergies among coalitions [30,34]. Forexample, nontrivial routing problems may need to be solved (potentially only approximately) in order to determinethe synergies. How to efficiently construct a stable solution when the cost of determining a synergy is significant(and possibly varying across coalitions) is an important open problem. Finally, we can investigate the same questionsunder different representations. These representations can be for restricted domains only (we discussed some resultsalong this line in Section 3); they can also be general, so that the representation is concise only on some instances(ideally those that are likely to occur in practice). In the latter category, we have recently introduced and studiedanother representation that allows for the decomposition of the characteristic function over distinct issues, each ofwhich concerns only a small number of the agents [7].AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.References[1] R.
