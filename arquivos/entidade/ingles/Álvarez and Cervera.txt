IntroductionNeuroscience or Neural Science is a very active and interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the brainand the nervous system. In spite of important advances made in recent decades, women are still underrepre-sented in neuroscience research output as a consequence of gender inequality in science overall. This studycarries out a scientometric analysis of the 30 neuroscience journals (2009–2010) with the highest impact inthe Web of Science database (Thomson Reuters) in order to quantitatively examine the current contributionof women in neuroscientific production, their pattern of research collaboration, scientific content, and theanalysis of scientific impact from a gender perspective. From a total of 66,937 authorships, gender could beidentified in 53,351 (79.7%) of them. Results revealed that 67.1% of the authorships corresponded to menand 32.9% to women. In relative terms, women tend to be concentrated in the first position of the authorshipby-line (which could be a reflection of new female incorporations into neuroscience research publishingtheir first studies), and much less in the last (senior) position. This double pattern suggests that age probablyplays a role in (partly) explaining gender asymmetry, both in science in general and in neuroscience in par-ticular.© 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.RECTEDDespite progress in recent decades, women are still underrepresented in science. Large-scale analyses reveal that global genderdisparities persist in different scientific fields. Recently, Larivière, Ni, Gingras, Cronin and Sugimoto (2013) presented a world-wide bibliometric analysis of more than 5 million research and review articles, including more than 27 million authorships, andthey found that, globally, women represent fewer than 30% of scientific authorships. West, Jacquet, King, Correll and Bergstrom(2013) carried out an analysis based on the JSTOR corpus, which comprises more than 8 million scientific documents, and theyagain revealed that important gender inequities remain in the current research production. Official reports from international or-ganizations reach similar conclusions. The UNESCO Science Report (UNESCO, 2015) states that worldwide only 28% of re-searchers are women. The last issue of She Figures (European Commission, 2016), the official report on gender equality in re-search and innovation in Europe, recently concluded that we are far from achieving gender parity, and that women represent onlyone third of European researchers. In the foreword of a previous issue, Marie Geoghecan-Quin, the European Commissioner forResearch, Innovation and Science, stated, “the figures do show us that some gaps have been reducing slowly over recent years, butgender imbalance in research is not a self-correcting phenomenon and so we must redouble our efforts” (European Commission,2013, p. 3).Empirical evidence shows that gender inequality is not confined to research output. Although in many countries the propor-tion of female undergraduates is equal to or higher than that of male undergraduates (OECD, 2015a; UNESCO 2015), womenoccupy fewer positions as full professors, and there is an imbalance in hiring, promotion, earnings and grant funding (for a re-view see e.g. Shen, 2013; UNESCO, 2015). The causes of this imbalance are probably complex, and they do not respond to aROCNU⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Basic and Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology, University of Jaume I, Av.

Inan elegant double-blind experiment, Moss-Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman (2012) identified faculty’s sub-tle gender biases toward female students. The authors asked 127 professors from six American research-intensive universities toreview a job application for a laboratory manager position. The application was identical for all professors, and it was randomlyassigned the name of a (fictitious) male or female student. Results demonstrated that the “male” applicants were rated as morecompetent and hireable than the identical “female” applicants, and they were offered a higher salary and more career mentoring.A mediation analysis revealed that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was perceived as less competent.Interestingly, the gender of the professors was unrelated to the judgments, and women exhibited the same gender bias as theirmale colleagues.In addition to large-scale studies about global gender inequality in science, recent work has focused the gender analysis on spe-cific fields, such as nanoscience and nanotechnology (Sotudeh & Khoshian, 2014), computing research (Cavero, Vela, Cáceres,Cuesta, & Sierra-Alonso, 2015), software engineering (Vela, Cáceres, & Cavero, 2012), materials science (Mauleón & Bordon,2006), medical literature (Jagsi et al., 2006), or psychology (Barrios, Villarroya, & Borrego, 2013). Neuroscience, or the scientificstudy of the brain and nervous system, is a very active and expanding research field that, according to the category descriptionfrom Web of Science, “covers resources on all areas of basic research on the brain, neural physiology, and function in health anddisease. The areas of focus include neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, neurochemistry, neural development, and neural behavior.Coverage also includes resources in neuro-endocrine and neuro-immune systems, somatosensory system, motor system and sen-sory motor integration, autonomic system as well as diseases of the nervous system” (Web of Science, Science Citation IndexExpanded, Scope notes, 2014). It is therefore an interdisciplinary field that collaborates with many other areas and has an increas-ing impact on contemporary science and human society. Several scientometric analyses without gender distinctions have focusedon the study of neuroscience production in different countries, such as India, Italy, Sweden or China, (e.g., Bala & Gupta, 2010;Berardelli, Defazio, Mancardi, & Messina, 2005; Glänzel et al., Danell, & Person, 2003; Xu, Chen, & Shen, 2008), but to ourknowledge no publication has performed a quantitative analysis of women’s participation in contemporary neuroscience.OPROFFor decades, women have contributed in a significant way to the development of neurosciences (Finger, 2002), but a signifi-cant gender gap still persists today. In 2006, an editorial of the influential journal Nature Neuroscience complained that only onein every five papers published in its pages had a female corresponding author, and the authors of the editorial wondered if thisasymmetry was simply a reflection of reality or if “it could also contribute to perpetuating the problem” (Nature Neuroscience,2006; p. 853). Since the creation of Women in Neuroscience (WIN) in 1980, an international organization “whose major goal is topromote the professional advancement of women neuroscientists” (Haak, 2002; p.70), there has been a strong interest in fosteringtheir contribution to today’s neuroscience. The Society for Neuroscience considers this goal a priority, and it currently devotesefforts and additional resources to increasing women’s participation in neuroscience, both in research and academia.Given the importance of knowing what women’s representation is within the brain sciences, we present a bibliometric analysisof the most influential neuroscience journals in order to quantitatively examine the current participation of women in scientificproduction in this research field. To accomplish this objective, the scientific production, the pattern of research collaboration, thecontent, and the scientific impact (or the number of citations a paper receives) are analyzed from a gender perspective.RECTED2.1. Databases and gender identificationThis study was based on Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science database. The 30 journals with the highest impact factor in theNEUROSCIENCES subject category were selected from the Journal Citation Reports (Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Edition,2014) (see Table 1). The impact factor of a scientific journal is a measure that indicates the average number of citations receivedby studies published in that journal, and it reflects the relative importance of journals within its field. Despite its criticisms, the ci-tation frequency reveals a journal’s relevance to its end users, particularly when the readers are primarily researchers (Saha, Saint,& Christakis, 2003). In the biomedical field, the correlation between impact factor and journal quality rated by field researchers isstrong (Saha et al., 2003). Consequently, our sample included a broad selection of the most important and influential journals ofthe neuroscience field. All the articles and reviews from 2009 to 2010 were extracted in text format and preprocessed through theBibExcel software (Persson, Danell, & Wiborg-Schneider, 2009) in order to perform the subsequent bibliometric analyses withthe BIbExcel and Microsoft Excel 2010 programs. We chose these two years because they are relatively recent and, at the sametime, far enough in the past to allow us to study the citations received by papers published in that time period. Records from onejournal (Molecular Psychiatry) were subsequently excluded from the analyses because most of its papers (more than 60%) did notprovide authors’ first names, only their initials, making it impossible to assign a gender to the authorships.The Web of Science (WoS) database, like most scientific databases, does not provide the authors’ gender. However, in 2008the WoS began to include the authors’ full names (field tag AF: Author Full Name), although a small proportion of records stilldisplay only the authors’ initials. After a preprocess of normalization that eliminated initials accompanying given names andreplaced hyphens with spaces, all authors’ first names were matched through GenderChecker, a database that includes 97,500ROCNU2.

In order to increase the numberof observations, unisex names were matched with the 1990 US Census, which presents lists of given names and their frequenciesassociated with males and females from the US population. When a name classified as unisex by GenderChecker presented arate above 90% vs. 10% associated with a specific gender in the US Census, the name was finally classified as belonging to thatgender (Larivière et al., 2013). For example, ‘Aaron’ appeared in the US Census 7209 times linked to men and 64 times linkedto women (99.1% vs. 0.9%); therefore, it was considered as a male name. Conversely, the name ‘Carmen’ accounted for 6210women and 330 men (95% vs. 5%) and, consequently, was classified as a female name.2.2. Variables studied2.3. Procedure2.4. Analysis of dataWe studied the following variables in relation to the gender of the researchers who published in the selected journals during2009–2010: number of authorships; number of authors (individuals); number of papers published by each author; geographicalorigin of authors (C1 field of WoS database); pattern of collaboration in co-authorship, including the national vs. internationallevels of collaboration and the analysis of author order in the by-line of each publication; content analysis through the analysisof the keywords extracted from the papers (ID field); and scientific impact measured as the number of citations received by eachpaper (TC field or Times Cited).After identifying the gender of the authorships of each publication, each variable studied was extracted from the ThomsonReuters Web of Science database using the BibExcel program (Persson et al., 2009). This software is a toolbox for bibliometri-cians that creates a file in which the values of an extracted variable are associated with each individual paper (identified with anumber). Finally, the values of all the variables studied were combined and entered in a master Excel database to perform the firstbibliometric analyses.RECTEDStatistical analyses of the bibliometric parameters were performed with SPSS v.18 and Microsoft Excel 2010. In order to ana-lyze contingencies of one categorical variable (e.g., gender: male vs. female authorships), we applied the Pearson Chi-square testcontrasting observed and expected frequencies according to the null hypothesis (no gender disparities). To analyze the relation-ship between two categorical variables (e.g., gender and USA/EU origin of authorships), we applied the Chi-square test and usedCramer’s V to determine the effect size or strength of the association. The standard interpretation of Cramer’s V for one degree offreedom (df) is: 0.10 = small, 0.30 = medium and 0.50 = large; for two df: 0.07 = small, 0.21 = medium and 0.35 = large (Cohen1988; Gravetter & Wallnau, 2012).When the dependent variable was continuous (e.g., number of papers published by each author), an ANOVA (analysis of vari-ance) was carried out on the factors studied, and we used Cohen’s d to calculate the effect size. Cohen's d is a statistic conven-tionally used to indicate the standardized difference between two means. According to Cohen’s guidelines (1988) for effect sizes,the values of d are interpreted as follows: 0.20 = small, 0.50 = medium and 0.80 = large.2.5. Validation studyTo test the accuracy of our data, we followed a similar procedure to Larivière et al. (2013). These authors selected a randomsample of 5000 authorships (less than 0.02%) from a total of 27,329,915 authorships to manually check their gender identity.We randomly selected 1% (670) from the total of 66,937 authorships and identified the gender of each author by locating somebiographical information or a photo on the internet. After several attempts, seven of the total number of authorships could not beidentified. The remaining 663 authorships were 441 males (66.5%) and 222 females (33.5%), yielding a proportion very close tothe overall rate of 35,776 (67.1%) males and 17,575 (32.9%) females. The difference between the observed frequencies in thevalidation study (441 males, 222 females) and the expected frequencies according to the overall rate (445 males, 218 females)was not significant, χ⁠2(1) = 0.10; p = 0.747.ROCNU3. Results3.1. Scientific productionA total of 11,590 papers (10,027 articles and 1563 reviews) published in 2009–2010 were obtained from the 29 journals an-alyzed (see Table 1). They were signed by 66,937 authorships, making an average of 5.78 authors/paper. After excluding theauthorships with only initials, unisex or unmatched given names with the GenderChecker database, 53,351 (79.7%) items withknown gender (male, female) were obtained (henceforth, the percentages of female or male authorships will always refer to theJournal of Informetrics xxx (2016) xxx-xxx5OFknown-gender total).⁠1 The total number of authorships with known gender included 35,776 (67.1%) men and 17,575 (32.9%)women⁠2 (Table 1); that is, female authorships are approximately one third of all authorships in the selected neurosciencejournals. Applying the Chi square test, the difference between male and female authorships was statistically significant,χ⁠2(df = 1) = 3,197.76; p< 0.0001; Cramer’s V = 0.173.⁠3OPRThe geographical location of each author’s institution was obtained by extracting the institutional information provided byeach paper (C1 field).⁠4 Table 2 presents the distribution of the authorships according to their gender and country, sorted by the to-tal number of authorships in descending order. The main scientific producer country, the United States of America (USA), showsa percentage of female authorships of 32.5% in neuroscience. With regard to the neuroscience production of the European Union(EU), we added the data from all the EU countries and obtained a percentage of 34.2% of female authorships, which represents1.7% more than the percentage of female authorship in the United States of America. This difference is small but significant;applying a Chi-square test to the data for the USA (15,661 males; 7534 females) and the EU (14,165 males; 7351 females), weobtained χ⁠2(1) = 14.26; p = 0.0002; Cramer’s V = 0.018.It is worth noting that countries such as Finland, Argentina and Poland showed percentages of female authorships above 50%.Brazil and some Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal (included in the Others category), present rates offemale participation above 40%. At the other extreme, Japan stands out for its low female participation in neuroscience publica-tions (18.2%). This low percentage coincides with its quite low female presence in science in general, according to Larivière etal. (2013), who found a female authorship percentage of 16% in Japan.It is worth to note that authorships are not the same as individuals (authors) because an individual can publish several papers.Our database included authors’ full names and also surnames and affiliations. We assumed that two or more records (authorships)with the same name and surname belonged to the same individual (author). If necessary, the affiliation was consulted. The 35,776male authorships corresponded to 20,928 different individuals (men), and the 17,575 female authorships corresponded to 12,824individuals (women). For each author (individual), we obtained the number of papers published by that author, and then all theauthors were separated by gender (males, females) in order to perform a between-subjects one-way ANOVA. Men yielded a meanproductivity of 1.71 papers/author (SD = 1.71), 95% CI [1.69, 1.73], and women yielded a mean productivity of 1.37 papers/au-thor (SD = 0.97), 95% CI [1.35, 1.39]. The analysis of variance showed that the difference between male and female productivitywas significant, although the effect size was small, F(1, 33,750) = 420.09, MS⁠e = 2.18, p < 0.0001, d = 0.245.As usual in science, Neuroscience publications are not evenly distributed among all authors. Table 3 presents the productivityof authors publishing in Neuroscience journals separated by gender. In bibliometric studies, the empirical distribution of authorproductivity is often compared to Lotka’s law (Lotka, 1926). According to this law, the number of authors contributing with npublications to a journal or a science field is about 1/n⁠b of those making one single contribution (where b nearly equals 2). Thismeans that about 63% of all authors will have just one publication, 16% will have two publications, 7% will have three publi-cations, etc. However, the b exponent can vary depending on several factors that may affect the shape of the distribution (Pao,1985). Our distribution of male authors fits Lotka’s law when b is equal to 2.91 (R⁠2 = 0.95); and the female distribution fits wellwhen b is equal to 3.37 (R⁠2 = 0.98), which suggests that the distance between prolific and non-prolific authors is greater in womenthan in men.RECTEDCollaboration among researchers has increased considerably in science in recent decades (OECD, 2015b; UNESCO, 2015),and one of the indicators most frequently used to measure scientific collaboration is co-authorship, when a researcher writes ascientific document with another researcher/s. The sample of 11,590 papers (articles and reviews) from the Neuroscience journalsanalyzed in the present study (2009–2010) were signed, on average, by 5.78 authors per paper, considering all authorships (knownand unknown gender). After selecting the authorships with known gender, the collaboration index for men was 3.09 authorships/paper, whereas for women it was 1.52 authorships/paper. This difference is logical because there are fewer female authorships tobe divided by the same denominator.3.2. CollaborationTable 4 shows the number of authorships/paper separated by gender. The calculation procedure was the following. First, thepapers with a single authorship were selected from the entire sample of neuroscience papers, and subsequently the percentagesof male and female authorships in this subsample were calculated. Next, the papers with two, three, or more authorships weresuccessively selected, and again the percentages of male and female authorships were computed for each subsample. Table 4ROCNU1 Regarding the number of papers, out of a total of 11,590 papers, 11,288 papers (97.4%) had at least one authorship with known gender (male or female);only 302 papers had no authorship with known gender.2 Most gender bibliometric studies are based on an entire count (one contribution per authorship in each paper). If our data are computed in a fractional way(in each paper, the fractional contribution of each authorship is calculated by dividing by the total number of authorships in that paper), the results are not verydifferent: the fractional contribution of men and women is 68.8% and 31.2%, respectively.3 In other words, the difference between the observed frequencies (35,776 males, 17,575 females) and the expected frequencies if there were no genderdifferences −null hypothesis– (26675.5 males, 26675.5 females), yielded χ⁠2(df = 1) = 3,197.76; p< 0.0001; Cramer’s V = 0.173.4 Some papers from Web of Science do not provide the institutional address information for some authors (C1 field). In these cases, the information providedby the RP field (Reprint Address) was used.6Journal of Informetrics xxx (2016) xxx-xxxTable 2Number and percentage of authorships in Neuroscience distributed by gender and geographical location and sorted by total number of authorships in descendingorder.TotalAuthorshipsTotal (knowngender)MaleAuthorships%FemaleAuthorships%OF32.5(34.2)27.031.838.933.218.247.631.943.633.530.439.534.334.026.338.155.423.426.836.543.933.223.556.058.540.767.5(65.8)73.068.261.166.881.852.468.156.466.569.660.565.766.073.761.944.676.673.263.556.166.876.544.067.559.3OPR7534(7351)1633156110028103531001521589369319121214192351642106884999368327962362%78.1714.494.051.410.920.390.230.080.090.050.020.040.020.010.020.0215,661(14,165)4416335115711633158411031111761734732185410372982661692232301721191371046244528RECTEDWomen%10,0251858519181118502910117352123GeographicallocationUSA(European Union)⁠aGermanyUnited KingdomFranceCanadaJapanItalyNetherlandsSpainAustraliaSwitzerlandPeoples R ChinaBelgiumSwedenSouth KoreaIsraelFinlandDenmarkAustriaNorwayBrazilIrelandHungaryArgentinaPolandOthers29,300(25,001)67755704305829712912238520301529128911881148737687652591543360345312245231155151129151023,195(21,516)6049491225732443193721041632135011031051306624564133430379291314271212205136141106890123456789101112131415161718192021<2168.0817.026.863.111.841.070.630.390.320.210.110.100.040.030.030.020.020.010.020.010.000.0714,24735611435651386223131826844232187755243114ROCNUaData obtained by adding the data from all the countries of the European Union, including the European countries contained within the Others category.Table 3Productivity of authors publishing in Neuroscience journals (2009–2010) separated by gender.

Table 4 reveals that thereis an increase in the percentage of women’s participation as the number of contributing authors in the paper increases, reaching35.2% of female authorship in papers written by more than ten authors; indeed, the Pearson correlation between the number ofauthorships/paper (1–10) and the percentage of female authorships is r = 0.869 (significant at p < 0.001).Another interesting point examined in the present study is the collaboration pattern of men and women at both national andinternational levels. After excluding the documents signed by a single author, all the papers were classified as stemming fromnational vs. international collaborations. National collaboration was considered when all the affiliation addresses of a given paperbelonged to a single country; international collaboration was considered when two or more affiliation addresses of a given paperbelonged to different countries. Within the subset of national papers (7462), the percentages of male and female authorships were66.4% (20,520 authorships) and 33.6% (10,385 authorships), respectively. Within the subset of international papers (3749), thepercentages of male and female authorships were 68.4% (14,618 authorships) and 32.0% (6881 authorships), respectively. Thisrelative difference was significant although with a very small effect size, (χ⁠2(1) = 14.63; p < 0.0001; Cramer’s V = 0.017); thatis, female participation is slightly lower in the publications resulting from an international collaboration than in the publicationsresulting from a national collaboration, in line with Lariviere et al’s (2013) data (see also Abramo, D'Angelo, & Murgia, 2013).Finally, our study examined the author order in the by-line of each paper. Following the procedure introduced by Kretschmer,Kundra, Beaver and Kretschmer (2012), the concentrations of females (COF) and males (COM) in each position of the by-linewere calculated. After excluding the single-author papers, the COF for each position was defined as the ratio between the per-centage of females in that specific position and the overall percentage of female authorships. In the same way, the COM ofeach position was defined as the ratio between the percentage of males in that specific position and the overall percentage ofmale authorships. The results are displayed in Fig. 1. Interestingly, in relative terms women are clearly overrepresented in thefirst position of multi-author papers, which means that within the overall female percentage (one third of total authorships),women tend to be concentrated in the first position of the by-line. This could be a reflection of new female incorporations intoRECTEDROCNUFig. 1.

Research contentneuroscience research publishing their first studies under the direction of a senior researcher (last position in the by-line). Con-tinuing with this idea, women are clearly underrepresented in the last position of the by-line. In many scientific fields, includingbiosciences, the last author position of a paper is a key position occupied by the leading member of the research group. This isespecially the case for articles with three or more co-authors (West et al., 2013). Consequently, we have calculated the COF andCOM values at the last position for all papers with at least three co-authors. Our double pattern of relative overrepresentation ofwomen in the first author position and relative underrepresentation of women in the last author position could suggest, as we willdiscuss further, that age probably plays a role in explaining gender asymmetry.In addition, we found that the collaborative pattern was different depending on which gender occupied the first and last posi-tions in the paper by-line. Within the set of multi-authored papers signed by a man in the first position, the percentages of maleand female authorships were 76.4% (19,916 male authorships) and 23.6% (6166 female authorships), respectively. However,within the set of multi-authored papers signed by a woman in the first position, the corresponding percentages were 52.5% (9623male authorships) and 47.5% (8690 female authorships). This difference of proportions resulted significant, (χ⁠2 (1) = 2739.82;p< 0.0001; Cramer’s V = 0.248). In a similar way, within the set of multi-authored papers signed by a man in the last position,the percentages of male and female authorships were 72.4% (27,065 male authorships) and 27.6% (10,333 female authorships),respectively. However, if the papers are signed by a woman in the last position, the male authorships (46.6%: 4624 male author-ships) are outweighed by the female authorships (53.4%, 5293 female authorships). This difference of proportions was significant,(χ⁠2(1) = 2348.53; p < 0.0001; Cramer’s V = 0.223. It seems that senior female researchers tend to establish scientific partnershipswith other women more than male seniors do; or perhaps they work on subtopics that are relatively more appealing to scientificwomen.OPROFRevisiting Table 2, we can see the journals that present a higher participation of female authorship: Frontiers in Neuroen-docrinology (48.2%, near gender parity), Journal of Pineal Research (42.6%), and Glia (40.8%). Apparently these journals aredevoted to more “medical” subjects (e.g., relation between endocrinology and the nervous system, research on the pineal glandand its hormonal products, anatomy and physiology of the glia cells, etc.). In the other extreme, we find Annual Review of Neu-roscience with only 13.6% of female authorships and Behavioral and Brain Sciences with a scarce 15.2%. In general, journalswith a strong theoretical component or specialized in reviewing and discussing the significant developments in the field (the twoprevious journals and Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Trends In Cognitive Sciences, Trends in Neurosciences, Current Opinion inNeurobiology) present a percentage of female participation quite below the overall mean. Authors who publish papers in thesejournals tend to be prestigious researchers with a consolidated (and presumably long) career. This fact is coherent with a smallproportion of women found in the senior (last) position of the authorship by-lines, which, as discussed beñow, is consistent withthe hypothesis that age probably plays a role in explaining the gender asymmetry in high-impact neuroscience.In order to carry out a more fine-grained analysis of the scientific content, a keyword analysis was conducted on the papers ofour sample. It should be noted that in addition to the keywords proposed by the authors themselves; Thomson Reuters has includeda new field in recent years (Keywords Plus); providing additional keywords to expand the search in the database (see Zhang etal., 2016; for a comparative study). We followed a similar procedure as reported in previous bibliometric studies (González &Cervera, 2016; González & Palomar, 2014) and extracted the Keywords Plus (ID field in WoS) for each publication and separatedby the gender of the authors occupying key positions in the document by-line.RECTEDTable S5 (see Supplemental Material) presents the top 25% of Keywords Plus extracted from all papers of our sample sep-arated by the gender of the authors occupying the first or last position in the authorship by-line. The keywords are sorted byabsolute frequency in descending order and they have been distributed according to their relative percentages for comparativepurposes (grouped in steps of 5%). To identify changes, the terms that rise one or more steps when going from male to femaleauthorships have been written in bold letters; conversely, the terms that descend one or more steps when going from male to fe-male authorships have been underlined. Apparently, it seems difficult to find an overall pattern of terms selectively associated tofemale (or male) authorships. Beyond some changes of positions for several terms related to different anatomical structures, it isremarkable that the keyword ‘children’ rises a relative position when going from male to female authorships, and the same occurswith a set of terms related to psychological research on cognitive and emotional processes, such as: ‘perception’, ‘recognitionmemory’, ‘episodic memory’, ‘facial expressions’, ‘individual-differences’, ‘response-inhibition’, ‘social cognition’, and also thekeywords ‘stress’, ‘mood disorders’ and ‘deficit hyperactivity disorder’.3.4. Scientific impactROCNUIf we revisit Table 1, keeping in mind that the journals are sorted in descending order by their impact factor in the JournalCitation Reports (Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Edition, 2014), it is evident that most of the first journals in this ranking presenta percentage of female participation below the overall female percentage (32.9%). In fact, the Pearson correlation coefficient be-tween the journal impact factors and their percentages of female authorships is negative and significant (r = −0.576, p < 0.001).Fig. 2 shows the regression plot of percentages of female authorship as a function of the impact factor (Journal Citation Reports(JCR) Edition, 2014) of the selected journals, and the regression line shows a negative slope (regression coefficient = −0.736).Journal of Informetrics xxx (2016) xxx-xxx9OFOPRFig. 2. Regression plot of percentages of female authorship as a function of the impact factor (Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Edition, 2014) of the 29 Neuro-science journals studied.RECTEDUsing the SJR (SCImago Journal Rank; available at http://www.scimagojr.com/) as a measure of the scientific influence of eachof the 29 journals studied, a negative correlation is also obtained with the% of female authorship (r = −0.475, p< 0.001).The number of citations that each paper received (TC, Times Cited) was extracted and subsequently assigned to every au-thorship of that paper; then all authorships were separated by gender (males, females) in order to perform a between-sub-jects one-way ANOVA. Overall, males received an average of 51.36 citations/authorship (SD = 59.98), 95% CI [50.74, 51.98],and females received an average of 48.78 citations/authorship (SD = 52.63) 95% CI [48.00, 49.57]. This citation differencewas significant, although the effect size was very small, F(1, 53,350) = 23.67, MS⁠e = 3,325.1, p < 0.0001, d = 0.046. Regard-ing the type of document, reviews received many more citations (76.83 citations/authorship) than regular articles (47.36 cita-tions/authorship), as expected. Once again, gender differences emerged for both types of papers, although the effect sizes werequite small. Within the set of reviews, the overall means were 81.09 citations/authorship (SD = 102.67), 95% CI [77.34, 84.84]for males, and 72.59 citations/authorship (SD = 89.34), 95% CI [67.80, 77.38] for females; F(1, 4214) = 6.80, MS⁠e = 9728.1,p = 0.009, d = 0.088. Within the set of regular articles, the citation difference, although significant, was quite small: 48.76 ci-tations/authorship (SD = 53.92), 95% CI [48.18, 49.34] for males, and 46.81 citations/authorship (SD = 47.85), 95% CI [46.07,47.55] for females; F(1, 49134) = 15.26, MS⁠e = 2703.1, p < 0.0001, d = 0.038.Reviews (1563) are a small part of the total number of papers (11,590). In a second step, we excluded the review documentsand computed citations received only by the regular articles. In a similar way to Larivière et al. (2013), we distinguished betweenmulti-authored papers resulting from national vs. international collaborations (see the Collaboration section above). Fig. 3 dis-plays the citation averages of Neuroscience articles with men and women in key positions of the by-line: single author, first author(of multi-authored articles), and last author (of multi-authored articles). The first point worth noting is that single-author articleswritten by a man or a woman received a similar number of citations: 33.75 vs. 33.43 citations, respectively; a between-subjectsone-way ANOVA yielded no statistically significant differences between genders, F(1, 112) < 1, p = 0.978. As expected, articlesresulting from international collaborations were more visible and globally received more citations (51.94) than those resultingfrom national collaborations (44.13).Within the set of national-collaboration articles, those in which a female occupied the first or the last position of the by-linewere slightly less cited that articles in which a male occupied these positions. Data for the first author position were: 43.87 ci-tations/article (SD = 50.46), 95% CI [42.07, 46.67] for males in the first position vs. 39.95 citations/article (SD = 41.64), 95%CI [38.12, 41.78] for females in the first position; F(1, 5004) = 8.28, MS⁠e = 222 2.7, p = 0.004, d = 0.085. Data for the last au-thor position in the by-line were: 42.52 citations/article (SD = 45.07), 95% CI [41.18, 43.87] for males in the last position vs.39.34 citations/article (SD = 40.73), 95% CI [37.00, 41.68] for females in the last position; F(1, 5479) = 4.74, MS⁠e = 1952.3,p = 0.030, d = 0.074. These differences were significant but quite small in terms of effect size.Within the set of international-collaboration articles, the gender difference was only significant for the last position. Datafor the first position were: 49.34 citations/article (SD = 62.19), 95% CI [46.02, 52.48] for males in the first position vs. 47.02citations/article (SD = 42.21), 95% CI [44.42, 49.62] for females in the first position; this difference was not significant, F(1,2525) = 1.08, MS⁠e = 3027.5, p = 0.299, d = 0.044.

Discussion and conclusionsWe examined the authorships of the reviews and articles published in 2009–2010 in the 29 journals with the highest impactwithin the NEUROSCIENCES category of the Journal Citation Reports (Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Edition, 2014), and weobserved that about one third of them (32.9%) corresponded to women. This female percentage is slightly higher than the globalpercentage obtained for overall scientific production. The last UNESCO Science Report (UNESCO, 2015) states that 28% ofresearchers are women. In a large-scale bibliometric analysis involving more than 27 million authorships worldwide across allscientific disciplines, Cassidy Sugimoto and colleagues (Larivière et al., 2013) found that women accounted for fewer than 30%of them. West et al. (2013) analyzed a subsample of 1.8 million science and humanities papers extracted from the JSTOR corpus,and they obtained an overall 21.9% of female authorships. It is clear that despite the advances made by women in scientific re-search in recent decades, a high degree of gender inequality still persists today.The scientific literature shows that this pattern of gender imbalance can vary across different fields. Recently, Cavero et al.(2015) analyzed the evolution of women participation in Computing research since its beginnings, and they observed a growthfrom <3% of all academic publications in 1966, to about 16.3% in 2010. Sotudeh & Khoshian (2014) studied women’s scientificproductivity in Nano Science & Technology during 2005–2007, and they verified that the total number of female publicationsonly accounted for 11.98% of all papers. In Software Engineering, Vela et al. (2012) reported that 17.2% of authors were female.Women’s participation in the medical profession has increased in recent decades; however, after analyzing authorships from U.S.institutions in six very prominent medical journals during the 1970–2004 period, Jagsi et al. (2006) concluded that “over the pastfour decades, the proportion of women among both first and senior physician-authors of original research in the United States hassignificantly increased. Nevertheless, women still compose a minority of the authors of original research and guest editorials inthe journals studied” (p. 281). Results from the extensive analysis by Larivière et al. (2013) confirmed previous findings and anec-dotal observations that fields associated with ‘care’ (health, psychology, education) present less gender disparity than ‘hard’ sci-ences (high-energy physics, robotics, computer sciences, etc.). West et al.’s (2013) data follow along the same lines: their Table 1shows the gender composition for disciplines within the JSTOR database (1990–2011), and the percentages of female authorshipsrange from 10.64% in Mathematics, 12.04% in Philosophy, 13.68% in Economics, 18.11% in Probability-Statistics,… to 37.57%in Pollution and occupational health, 41.41% in Sociology, 41.90% in Demography, and finally 46.35% in Education. It is worthnoting that our average of 32.9% female authorships within the Neuroscience journals is located between the two extremes, quiteclose to the Cognitive Sciences percentage (32.12%) from West et al. (2013).ROCNUThe pattern of female collaboration in neuroscience publications is less international than male collaboration, in agreementwith Larivière et al.’s (2013) findings for science overall, although this difference is smaller in our case. We also looked at thegender composition of each authorship position in the by-line of every neuroscience paper and found some interesting differ-ences between men and women. It should be noted that the first and last author positions usually are key positions in the publica-tions of many scientific fields, including biosciences and neuroscience, except in fields or subfields where the convention is forJournal of Informetrics xxx (2016) xxx-xxx11OFOPRalphabetical order (e.g. mathematics). Ludo Waltman (2012) analyzed 24.8 million publications in all fields of science in the pe-riod 1981–2011 and found that the use of alphabetical authorship is declining over time. In 2011, less than 4% of all publicationspresented their by-line in alphabetical order. The use of alphabetical authorship is most common in mathematics, economics, andalso in high energy physics (typically with a very large number of authors). In our sample (Fig. 1), women are overrepresentedin the first position of multi-author publications, which means that, within the overall female percentage representing half thatof men, they tend to be concentrated in the first position of the paper by-line. This point is especially interesting because Cas-sidy Sugimoto and colleagues found −with important differences between fields– that women are much less likely to be listed asfirst author in research output worldwide (Larivière et al.’s, 2013). Our relative female overrepresentation in the first authorshipposition could be a reflection of new incorporations of women into neuroscience research −perhaps publishing their first postdoc-toral papers. By contrast, women are clearly underrepresented in the last position of the by-line, usually a key position reservedfor the senior or leading member of the research team. The relative underrepresentation of women in the last author position isa widespread fact observed in many scientific fields, including biosciences (Larivière et al., 2013), although not in mathematicsor economics, for instance, in which the author order is alphabetical (Waltman, 2012). Our double pattern of relative overrep-resentation of women in the first author position and relative underrepresentation in the last position suggests that age probablyplays an important role in explaining the current gender imbalance in research production. This idea is reinforced by the asym-metries observed in the scientific impact. When the number of citations that each paper has received (TC field, or Times Cited)is extracted and subsequently assigned to each authorship, female researchers on average receive about 2.5 citations less thanmale researchers. This difference rises to 8.5 citations when considering only the reviews (without articles). Many reviews in oursample are single-author papers published in very high-impact journals and written by a senior researcher (Fig. 1). Curiously,when reviews are removed, the scientific impact of single-author regular articles is the same for men and women (Fig. 3). Atthe same time, the greatest asymmetry in the scientific impact of multi-authored articles is linked to the gender composition ofthe last/senior position in studies performed under international collaboration (Fig. 3). The current gender gap in neuroscience−and science in general– is a complex and multi-causal phenomenon, but evidence suggests that age undoubtedly plays a role. AsLarivière et al. (2013) state, “the academic pipeline from junior to senior faculty leaks female scientists, and the senior ranks ofscience bear the imprint of previous generations’ barriers to the progression of women. Thus it is likely that many of the trendswe observed can be explained by the under-representation of women among the elders of science. After all, seniority, authorshipposition, collaboration and citation are all highly interlinked variables” (p. 213). For example, according with the US NationalScience Foundation (National Science Foundation (NSF), 2015; see also Hopkins, Jawitz, McCarty, Goldman, & Basu, 2013),women are only slightly underrepresented among doctoral graduates at US universities, but they are importantly underrepresentedin academic positions. A limitation of the present study is that we have not direct evidence to test the age hypothesis becausethe WoS database (and any other bibliographic database) does not provide data about the authors’ age. Nevertheless, the largergender asymmetry observed in the number of reviews is also coherent with this hypothesis. Reviews published in high-impactjournals are usually written by reputable and influential researchers that typically occupy senior positions as leaders of researchteams. In some way, the age story is a hopeful story since it implies that (at least a part of) gender inequality in science will tendto vanish in the near future. Some data point in that direction. Thus, Van Arensbergen, Van der Weijden, & Van den Besselaar(2012) recently compared male and female researchers using data on research grant applications in the Netherlands, and they con-cluded that gender differences in terms of publications and citations are disappearing in the younger generation of scientists (seealso Marsh, Jayasinghe, & Bond, 2011; Rørstad & Aksnes. 2015).RECTEDIn summary, women have been contributing in a significant way to the development of neurosciences (Finger, 2002), andtheir participation in the past few decades has increased impressively (Haak, 2002). According to the Society for Neuroscience(SfN), women have had an increasing presence within the field, going from being 21% of SfN members in 1982 to 43% in 2011.However, despite their progress, it can be concluded that women still have not achieved a proportionate level of relevance inneuroscience research output. As mentioned above, one of reasons for this asymmetry probably has to do with age, and part ofthe imbalance will be corrected in the coming years, but surely other forces continue to act in the opposite direction −differentialinvestment in family and childcare, subtle gender bias, etc. It is important, therefore, to continue the SfN policy of increasing theopportunities “to highlight the scientific excellence of women neuroscientists, address the challenges women may confront in aca-demic and other professional settings, educate about and overcome gender-bias, and advance training opportunities for women”(SfN, Women in Neuroscience, https://www.sfn.org/careers-and-training/women-in-neuroscience.)ROCNUFundingAuthors' ContributionsJulio González-Álvarez: Conceived and designed the analysis; collected the data; contributed data or analysis tools; preformanalysis; wrote paper.performed statistical analysis;Teresa Cervera-Crespo: conceived and designed the analysis; contributed data or analysis tools; wrote Paper.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Research Grant FFI2014-54088-P).OF12Journal of Informetrics xxx (2016) xxx-xxxAppendix A.
