Overthe years since the theorem was proved in 1950, quite a few alternative proofs have beenput forward. In this paper, we propose yet another alternative proof of the theorem. Thebasic idea is to use induction to reduce the theorem to the base case with 3 alternativesand 2 agents and then use computers to verify the base case. This turns out to be aneffective approach for proving other impossibility theorems such as Muller–Satterthwaiteand Sen’s theorems as well. Motivated by the insights of the proof, we discover a newtheorem with the help of computer programs. We believe this new proof opens an excitingprospect of using computers to discover similar impossibility or even possibility results.© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionRecently, there has been much interest and work in applying economics models such as those from social choice theoryto computer science problems as well as computational techniques to solving problems in social choice theory. In this paper,we consider a different application of AI to economics: using computers to help prove and discover theorems in social choicetheory.The particular theorems that we are interested in are the impossibility theorems such as those by Arrow [3], Sen [20],and Muller and Satterthwaite [15] in social choice theory [2], an area concerning about how individual preferences canbe aggregated to form a collective preference in a society. Social choice theory has sometimes been called “a science ofthe impossible” because of the many famous impossibility theorems that have been proved in it. Among them, Arrow’stheorem [3] on the non-existence of rational social welfare function is without doubt the most famous one. It shows thenon-existence of the collective social preference (called social welfare function) even when some minimal standards such asPareto efficiency and non-dictatorship are imposed. Arrow’s original proof of this result is relatively complex, and over theyears, quite a few alternative proofs have been advanced (see e.g. [4,7,8,21]).In this paper, we propose yet another alternative proof of this result, with the help of computers. Briefly, Arrow’s the-orem says that in a society with at least three possible outcomes (alternatives) for each agent, it is impossible to have asocial welfare function that satisfies the following three conditions: unanimity (Pareto efficiency), independent of irrelevantalternatives (IIA), and non-dictatorship. We shall show by induction that this result holds if and only if it holds for the basecase when there are exactly two agents and three alternatives (the single agent case is trivial). For the base case, we verifyit using computers in two ways. One views the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and uses a depth-firstsearch algorithm to generate all social welfare functions that satisfy the first two conditions, and then verifies that all of✩An earlier version of this paper appeared in Proceedings of AAAI’08.* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: kenshin@cse.ust.hk (P.

Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053them are dictatorial. The other translates these conditions to a logical theory and uses a SAT solver to verify that the re-sulting logical theory is not satisfiable. Either way, it took less than one second on an AMD Opteron-based server (with 41.8 GHz CPUs and 8 GB RAM) for the base case to be verified.As it turns out, this strategy works not just for proving Arrow’s theorem. The same inductive proof can be adaptedalmost directly for proving other impossibility results such as Sen’s and Muller–Satterthwaite theorems. We have used it toprove Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem [9,19] as well, but we leave its proof to another paper.As a byproduct of our proof of Arrow’s theorem, the social welfare functions that satisfies IIA only in the base case canall be generated by our program. To our surprise, the number of such functions is so small that we are able to look at themone by one. By doing so, we form an interesting conjecture and then prove it using the same techniques as in the previousproofs. We then demonstrate the powerfulness of the newly proved theorem by showing that it subsumes both Arrow’s andWilson’s theorems.These proofs suggest that many of the impossibility results in social choice theory are all rooted in some small basecases. Thus an interesting thing to do is to use computers to explore these small base cases to try to come up with newconjectures automatically, and to understand the boundary between impossibility and possibility results. This is what wethink the long term implication of our new proofs of Arrow’s and other impossibility theorems lies, and the main reasonwhy we want to formulate the conditions in these theorems in a logical language and use a SAT solver to check theirconsistency.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we review Arrow’s theorem and then describe ournew inductive proof of this result. We then describe in Sections 4 and 5 how this proof can be adapted to prove Muller–Satterthwaite theorem and Sen’s theorem. In Section 6, We describe the idea of making use of computer programs todiscover new theorems in social choice theory and a theorem discovered this way. We then propose in Section 7 a logicallanguage for social choice theory and describe how it can be used to axiomatize Arrow’s theorem and how the base case inour inductive proof of Arrow’s theorem can be checked using a SAT solver. Finally, we conclude this paper with a summaryof our results and an outlook on future research.2. Arrow’s theoremA voting model is a tuple (N, O ), where N is a finite set of individuals (agents) and O a finite set of outcomes (alterna-tives). An agent’s preference ordering is a linear ordering of O , and a preference profile > of (N, O ) is a tuple (>1, . . . , >n),where >i is agent i’s preference ordering, and n the size of N. In the following, when N is clear from the context, we alsocall > a preference profile of O . Similarly, when O is clear from the context, we also call it a preference profile of N.Definition 1. Given a voting model (N, O ), a social welfare function is a function W : Ln → L, where L is the set of linearordering of O , and n the size of N.A social welfare function defines a social ordering for each preference profile. If we consider the social ordering givenby a social welfare function as the aggregates of the preference orderings of the individuals in the society, it is natural toimpose some conditions on it. For instance, it should not be dictatorial in that the aggregated societal preference orderingalways is the same as a particular individual’s preference. Arrow showed that a seemingly minimal set of such conditionsturns out to be inconsistent.In the following, given a preference profile > = (>1, . . . , >n), we sometimes write >W for W (>). Thus both a >W b anda W (>) b mean the same thing: the alternative a is preferred over the alternative b according to the societal preferenceordering W (>).Definition 2. A social welfare function W is unanimous (Pareto efficient) if for all alternatives a1 and a2, we have that ifa1 >i a2 for every agent i, then a1 >W a2In words, if everyone ranks alternative a1 above a2, then a1 must be ranked above a2 socially.Definition 3. A social welfare function W is independent of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) if for all alternatives a1 and a2, and allpreference profiles >(cid:4), we have that ∀i a1 >(cid:4)i a2 implies that a1 >(cid:4)W a2 iff a1 >(cid:4)(cid:4)i a2 iff a1 >(cid:4)(cid:4)and >(cid:4)(cid:4)W a2.Literally, IIA means that the relative social ordering of two alternatives depends only on their relative orderings given byeach agent and has nothing to do with other alternatives.Definition 4. An agent i is a dictator in a social welfare function W if for all alternatives a1 and a2, a1 >W a2 iff a1 >i a2. Ifthere is a dictator in W , then it is said to be dictatorial. Otherwise, W is said to be non-dictatorial.It is easy to see that if there are at least two alternatives, then there can be at most one dictator in any social welfarefunction.P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–10531043Theorem 1 (Arrow’s theorem [3]). For any voting model (N, O ), if |O | (cid:2) 3, then any social welfare function that is unanimous and IIAis also dictatorial.Arrow’s original proof of this result is somewhat complicated, and there are several alternative proofs by others, e.g.[4,7,8]. We now give yet another one using induction.3. An inductive proof of Arrow’s theoremFor ease of presentation, we assume the following notations.• For any set S, we use S−a to denote S \ {a}, i.e. the result of deleting a in S.• We extend the above notation to tuples as well: if t = (t1, . . . , tn), then we use t−i to denote the tuple (t1, . . . , ti−1,ti+1, . . . , tn). Furthermore, we use (t−i, s) to denote the result of replacing ith item in t by s: (t−i, s) = (t1, . . . , ti−1,s, ti+1, . . . , tn). We use t−{i, j} to denote (t−i)− j .• If > is a linear ordering of O , and a ∈ O , then we let >−a be the restriction of > on O −a: for any a(cid:4) >−a a(cid:4)(cid:4). On the other hand, if > is a linear ordering of O −a for some a ∈ O , then we let >+a be the extension ofiff a> to O such that for any ato be the extension of > to O such that for any+a(cid:4) ∈ O −a, a >a+−a is (>−a)+a, i.e. the result of moving a toathe bottom of the ordering. These notations extend to tuples of orderings. Thus if > is a preference profile of (N, O −a),then. Thus if > is a linear ordering of O , and a ∈ O , then >(cid:4) >+a a. Similarly, we let >a+(cid:4)(cid:4) ∈ O −a, a(cid:4) ∈ O −a, a(cid:4) > a(cid:4), aa(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)>+a = (>1, . . . , >n)+a = (>which will be a preference profile of (N, O ). Similarly for >a++a1 , . . . , >+an ),.Like any inductive proof, there are two cases for our proof, the inductive case and the base case.3.1. The inductive caseLemma 1. If there is a social welfare function for n individuals and m + 1 alternatives that is unanimous, IIA and non-dictatorial, thenthere is a social welfare function for n individuals and m alternatives that satisfies these three conditions as well, for all n (cid:2) 2, m (cid:2) 3.Proof. Let N = {1, . . . , n} be a set of n agents, O a set of m + 1 alternatives, and W a social welfare function for (N, O ) thatsatisfies the three conditions in the lemma. We show that there is an a ∈ O such that the “restriction” of W on O −a alsosatisfies these three conditions.For any a ∈ O , we define the restriction of W on O −a, written W a, to be the following function: for any preferenceprofile > = (>1, . . . , >n) of O −a, W a(>) = W (>+a)−a. In other words, W a(>) is the result of applying W to the preferenceprofile >+a of O , and then projecting it on O −a. The key property of this welfare function is that for any ain O −a,and any preference profile > of O −a, aiff aW (>+a) aW a(>) aand a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4).(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)We show that W a is unanimous and IIA:• Suppose a(cid:4)(cid:4) ∈ O −a and a(cid:4), aW (>+a) a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4). Thus a(cid:4), a(cid:4)(cid:4) ∈ O −a and >(cid:4), >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)+a(cid:4)(cid:4)ai(cid:4)a• Let a(cid:4) >athat W a is also IIA.as well. Since W is IIA, a(cid:4) >i a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) >for all i. By our definition a. This shows that W a is unanimous.W a(>) a+ai(cid:4)(cid:4)afor all i as well. Since W is unanimous,be two preference profiles of O −a such that ∀i a(cid:4)(cid:4). Hence aiff aW (>(cid:4)(cid:4)+a) aW (>(cid:4)+a) a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)iff ai a(cid:4)(cid:4)W a(>(cid:4)) a(cid:4) >(cid:4)(cid:4)i a(cid:4)iff a(cid:4)(cid:4). Thus ∀i a(cid:4)(cid:4)W a(>(cid:4)(cid:4)) a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)+ai(cid:4) >iff. This showsaWe now show that there is an a ∈ O such that W a is not dictatorial. First for any a ∈ O and any aprofile > of O , we have(cid:4), a(cid:4)(cid:4) ∈ O −a, and any(cid:4)a(cid:4)(cid:4)>W a(cid:4)iff aW (>+a−a) a(cid:4)(cid:4).This follows because W is IIA and a(cid:4), a(cid:4)(cid:4) ∈ O −a.(1)Now let b be any alternative in O . Suppose W b has a dictator, say agent 1 in it. Since W is not dictatorial, there mustbe a preference profile > of O and some c, d ∈ O such that c >1 d but d >W c. Since |O | = m + 1 > 3, we can find analternative e ∈ O −b \ {c, d}. We now show that W e is not dictatorial. Suppose otherwise. There are two cases:• Agent 1 is again the dictator in W e . Then W e(>−e) and >1 agree on c and d. Thus c W e(>−e) d. By our definition+e+e−e)]−e d. Since c, d ∈ O −e , this means that c W (>−e) d. By (1), we have c >W d, aof W e , this means that c [W (>contradiction with our assumption that d >W c.1044P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053• Another agent, say agent 2 is the dictator in W e . Let a1 (cid:7)= a2 be any two alternatives in O \ {b, e}. This is possible since1 a2, {a1, a2} ⊆ O −b, and that2 a1,2 a1. From a1 >(cid:4)W a2 as we have done in the previous case. Similarly, from a2 >(cid:4)1 a2 but a2 >(cid:4)|O | > 3. Let >(cid:4)agent 1 is the dictator in W b, we can conclude a1 >(cid:4){a,a2} ⊆ O −e , and that agent 2 is the dictator in W e , we can conclude a2 >(cid:4)be a preference profile of O such that a1 >(cid:4)W a1, a contradiction.Thus we have shown that W e cannot have a dictator. (cid:2)Note that it is essential for our proof that m (cid:2) 3. Notice also that we only use the assumptions that W is IIA and non-dictatorial in our proof that W a is not dictatorial for some a ∈ O . The assumption that W is unanimous is used only inshowing that W a is also unanimous.Lemma 2. If there is a social welfare function for n + 1 individuals and m alternatives that is unanimous, IIA and non-dictatorial,there will also be a social welfare function for n individual and m alternatives that satisfies these three conditions as well, for all n (cid:2) 2,m (cid:2) 3.Proof. Let N = {1, . . . , n, n + 1} be a set of agents, and O a set of m alternatives, and W a social welfare function for (N, O )that satisfies the three conditions in the lemma. For any i (cid:7)= j ∈ N, we define W i, j to be the following social welfare functionfor (N−i, O ): for any preference profile > of (N, O ), W i, j(>−i) = W (>−i, > j), where (>−i, > j), as we defined earlier, isthe result of replacing >i in > by > j . Thus the social welfare function W i, j is defined through W by making agent i andagent j always agreeing with each other. Clearly, for any i, j, W i, j is unanimous and IIA because W satisfies these twoconditions. We now show that we can find two distinct agents i and j such that W i, j is not dictatorial. Suppose otherwise,for every pair i > j ∈ N, W i, j is dictatorial. Now consider three distinct agents i1 < i2 < i3 in N. This is possible because|N| = n + 1 (cid:2) 3. Suppose i is the dictator in W i1,i2 , j the dictator in W i1,i3 , and k the dictator in W i2,i3 . There are two cases:• Case 1: i = j = k. Since W is not dictatorial, there is a profile > of (N, O ) and two alternatives a1 and a2 such that>W and >i disagree on a1 and a2, say a1 >i a2 but a2 >W a1. Now at least two players from {i1, i2, i3} must agree ona1, a2. Let these two players be j1 and j2, and without loss of generality, suppose j1 < j2. Now consider the profile(>− j1 , > j2 ). Since W is IIA, and because > j1 and > j2 agree on a1 and a2, >W and W (>− j1 , > j2 ) must agree on a1and a2. So a2 W (>− j1 , > j2 ) a1. But i is the dictator in W j1, j2 , W j1, j2 (>− j1 ) must agree with >i . Since W j1, j2 (>− j1 )is defined to be W (>− j1 , > j2 ), thus W (>− j1 , > j2 ) agrees with >i , so a1 W (>− j1 , > j2 ) a2, a contradiction.• Case 2: i (cid:7)= j or i (cid:7)= k or j (cid:7)= k. First, by our definition of W x, y , and our assumption that agents i, j, and k are dictators= >i3 , then >W = >i ,in W i1,i2 , W i1,i3 , and W i2,i3 , respectively, for any preference profile > of (N, O ), if >i1>W = > j , and >W = >k. Since two of {i, j, k} must be distinct, this means that {i, j, k} ⊆ {i1, i2, i3}. Since i must be inN−i1 , so i (cid:7)= i1, thus i ∈ {i2, i3}. Similarly,j,and k. Each of them will lead to a contradiction, using the following table:j ∈ {i2, i3} and k ∈ {i1, i3}. This leads to eight possible combinations for i,= >i2(i, j, k)(i2, i2, i1)(i2, i2, i3)(i2, i3, i1)(i2, i3, i3)(i3, i2, i1)(i3, i2, i3)(i3, i3, i1)(i3, i3, i3)>i1c > a > b>i2a > b > c>i3a > c > bcase 1case 1c > a > bc > a > bb > a > cb > c > ab > c > aa > b > cb > c > ab > a > ca > b > cb > c > aa > b > ca > b > ccase 1Each row in the above table either gives a preference profile that will lead to a contradiction or point to “case 1”,meaning a contradiction can be derived similar to case 1. For instance, consider the row (i, j, k) = (i2, i3, i1), which says“case 1”. This case can be reduced to “case 1” as follows. Since i = i2 is the dictator in W i1,i2 , i1 is the dictator in W i2,i1 .Similarly, i1 is the dictator in W i3,i1 because i3 = k is the dictator in W i1,i3 . Thus i1 is the dictator in W i2,i1 , W i3,i1 , andW i2,i3 , and the same reasoning in case 1 will lead to a contradiction here.Now consider the first row (i, j, k) = (i2, i2, i1), and the preference profile > given in the row:c >i1 a >i1 b,a >i2 b >i2 c,a >i3 c >i3 b.Because i2 = j is the dictator in W i1,i3 , W (>−i1 , >i3 ) = >i2 . But >i1 and >i3 agree on b and c, thus by IIA:b >W ciff b W (>−i1 , >i3 ) ciff b >i2 c.Sob >W c.(2)P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053Similarly, >i1 and >i2 agree on a and b, and i2 is the dictator in W i1,i2 , thus a >W b iff a >i2 b. Soa >W b.1045(3)Now >i2 and >i3 agree on a and c, and i1 is the dictator in W i2,i3 , thus a >W c iff a >i1 c. So c >W a, which contradictswith (2) and (3). The other cases are similar.This means that there must be some i (cid:7)= j ∈ N such that W i, j is not dictatorial. (cid:2)Again notice that it is essential for our proof that |N| = n + 1 (cid:2) 3, and that the existence of a non-dictatorial W i, jdepends only on the assumptions that W is IIA and non-dictatorial.By these two lemmas, we see that Arrow’s theorem holds iff it holds for the case when there are exactly two agents andthree possible outcomes.13.2. The base caseWe now turn to the proof of the base case, and as we mentioned earlier, we use computer programs to do that.The base case says that when |N| = 2 and |O | = 3, there is no social welfare function on (N, O ) that is unanimous, IIA,and non-dictatorial. A straightforward way of verifying this is to generate all possible social welfare functions in (N, O ) andcheck all of them one by one for these three conditions. However, there are too many such functions for this to be feasibleon current computers: there are 3! = 6 number of linear orderings of O , resulting in 6 × 6 = 36 total number of preferenceprofiles of (N, O ), and 636 possible social welfare functions.Thus one should not attempt to explicitly generate all possible social welfare functions. What we did instead is togenerate explicitly all social welfare functions that satisfy the conditions of unanimity and IIA, and then check if any ofthem is non-dictatorial.We treat the problem of generating all social welfare functions that satisfy the conditions of unanimity and IIA as aconstraint satisfaction problem (CSP). A CSP is a triple (V , D, C), where V is a set of variables, and D a set of domains, onefor each variable in V , and C a set of constraints on V (see, e.g. [18]). An assignment of the CSP is a function that mapseach variable in V to a value in its domain. A solution to the CSP is an assignment that satisfies all constraints in C .Now consider the voting model ({1, 2}, {a, b, c}) in our base case. We define a CSP for it by introducing 36 variablesx1, . . . , x36, one for each preference profile of the voting model. The domain of these variables is the set of 6 linear or-derings of {a, b, c}, and the constraints are the instantiations of the unanimity and IIA conditions on the voting model. Ascan be easily seen, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the social welfare functions of the voting model andthe assignments of the CSP. Furthermore, a solution to the CSP corresponds to a social welfare function that satisfies theunanimity and IIA conditions, and vice versa.To solve this CSP, we use a depth-first search that backtracks whenever the current partial assignment violates theconstraints, and implemented it in SWI-Prolog. As we mentioned earlier, when run on our AMD server machine, our Prologprogram returned in less than one second two solutions, one corresponds to the social welfare function where agent 1 isthe dictator, and the other agent 2 the dictator.This verifies the base case of our inductive proof of Arrow’s theorem, thus completes our proof. As mentioned in theintroduction, we also verified the base case using a SAT solver. This requires a logical language to encode postulates in socialchoice theory, and will be described in a separate section below.At last, it is worth noting that Suzumura [21] also provided, in his presidential address to the Japanese Economic Asso-ciation, a specific backwards induction proof that reduces Arrow’s theorem to two agents (but n alternatives) base case andthen proves the base case with almost the same amount of efforts as the inductive case. In contrast, our further reductionto three alternatives case makes the computational verification possible and as we will show, our reduction to two agentscase is more general and can be used to prove other impossibility theorems.4. Muller–Satterthwaite theoremAs mentioned before, the same strategy that we used for proving Arrow’s theorem can be used to prove other impossi-bility theorems. In fact, we have modified the above proof for proving Sen’s and Muller–Satterthwaite theorems. We provein the following Muller–Satterthwaite theorem (cf. e.g. [12]).Arrow’s theorem is about the social welfare function which maps a preference profile to a preference ordering. In com-parison, Muller–Satterthwaite theorem concerns about social choice function which maps a preference profile to an outcomewhich is supposed to be the “winner” of the election (as represented by the preference profile).Definition 5. Given a voting model (N, O ), a social choice function is a function C : Ln → O , where L is the set of linearorders on O , and n the number of agents in N.1 Technically speaking, we also need to consider the case when |N| = 1, but this is a trivial case.1046P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053Instead of the conditions of unanimity, IIA, and non-dictatorship in Arrow’s theorem, Muller and Satterthwaite consideredthe following three corresponding conditions.Definition 6. A social choice function C is weakly unanimous if for every preference profile >, if there is a pair of alternativesa1, a2 such that a1 >i a2 for every agent i, then C(>) (cid:7)= a2.Thus according to this condition, an alternative that is dominated by another should never be selected.Definition 7. A social choice function C is monotonic if, for every preference profile > such that C(>) = a, if >(cid:4)profile such that a >(cid:4)for every agent i and every alternative a, then C(>(cid:4)) = a as well.whenever a >i a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)i ais anotherIn words, monotonicity means that if a choice function selects an outcome for a preference profile, then it will also selectthis outcome for any other preference profile that does not decrease the ranking of this outcome.Definition 8. An agent i is a dictator in a social choice function C if C always selects i’s top choice: for every preferenceprofile >, C(>) = a iff for all a(cid:4) ∈ O that is different from a, a >i a. C is non-dictatorial if it has no dictator.(cid:4)Theorem 2 (Muller–Satterthwaite theorem [15]). For any voting model (N, O ) such that |O | (cid:2) 3, any social choice function that isweakly unanimous and monotonic is also dictatorial.Like our proof of Arrow’s theorem, we prove this theorem by induction. The inductive step is again by two lemmassimilar to the ones for Arrow’s theorem.Lemma 3. If there is a social choice function for n individuals and m + 1 alternatives that is weakly unanimous, monotonic and non-dictatorial, then there is also a social choice function for n individuals and m alternatives that satisfies these three conditions, for alln (cid:2) 2, m (cid:2) 3.Proof. Let (N, O ) be a voting model such that |N| = n and |O | = m + 1, and C a social choice function that satisfies thethree conditions in the lemma. Just like our proof of the corresponding Lemma 1, for any a ∈ O , we define Ca to be a socialchoice function that is the “restriction” of C on O −a: for any preference profile > of O −a, Ca(>) = C(>+a). Again it can beeasily seen that for any a ∈ O , Ca is weakly unanimous and monotonic. Now we show that there is one such a such that Cais non-dictatorial.Suppose otherwise: for any a, Ca is dictatorial. We start by assuming Cb has a dictator i. Since C is non-dictatorial, wecan find a profile >∈ O such that C(>) = c (cid:7)= d, where d is top ranked outcome according to >i . Since there are |m + 1| (cid:2) 4outcomes, we can find another outcome e that is distinct from b, c, d. Now we consider Ce , there are two cases:• Ce still has agent i as its dictator. We have d = Ce((>)−e) = C((>)+e−e) = C(>) = c, which leads to a contradiction since c (cid:7)= d.• Ce has a dictator j (cid:7)= i. For any preference profile >(cid:4) ∈ O such that fC((>)top according to >(cid:4)j ,+e−e and >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) = ((>)((>)have C(>(cid:4)(cid:4)) = C(>(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)). This leads to a contradiction.+b−b)i , g is rankedf (cid:7)= g and f , g are distinct from b, e, we consider the following two preference profiles >(cid:4)(cid:4) =+b−b. Clearly, we have C(>(cid:4)(cid:4)) = g and C(>(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)) = f . However, according to monotonicity, we+e−e)is ranked top according to >(cid:4)+e−e), but according to monotonicity, we haveTherefore, Ce cannot have a dictator. So we have prove that there is always a outcome a so that Ca is non-dictatorial. (cid:2)Lemma 4. If there is a social choice function for n + 1 individuals and m alternatives that is weakly unanimous, monotonic and non-dictatorial, then there is also a social choice function for n individuals and m alternatives that satisfies these three conditions, for alln (cid:2) 2, m (cid:2) 3.Proof. Let (N, O ) be a voting model such that |N| = n + 1 and |O | = m, and C a social choice function that satisfies thethree conditions in the lemma. Just like our proof of Lemma 2, for any pair of agents i (cid:7)= j ∈ N, we define Ci, j to be thefollowing social welfare function for (N−i, O ): for any preference profile > of (N, O ), Ci, j(>−i) = C(>−i, > j). Again it canbe easily seen that for any pair of agents i (cid:7)= j, Ci, j is weakly unanimous and monotonic.We prove in the following that we can find two distinct agents i, j such that Ci, j is non-dictatorial. Suppose not, thenfor every pair of agents i, j, there is an agent di, j that is a dictator of Ci, j . We first show that di, j = j for any i, j. Supposeotherwise, di, j = k (cid:7)= j. Since C is non-dictatorial, we can find a profile > such that a = C(>) (cid:7)= b where b is on top of >k.We then still have C(>−{i, j}, (> j)a+−a) = a according to monotonicity of C . But according to the dictatorship of Ci, j ,we have C(>−{i, j}, (> j)a+−a) = b, a contradiction. Therefore, we have di, j = j for any i, j.−a, (> j)a+−a, (> j)a+P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–10531047Now consider a profile any > on (N + 1, O ), any triple of agents i, j, k and any triple of alternatives (this is possiblesince |N + 1| (cid:2) 3, |O | (cid:2) 3) where• a >i c >i b >i . . . for >i• c > j b > j a > j . . . for > j• b >k a >k c >k . . . for >kNotice that >i, > j, >k only differ in {a, b, c}. There are the following cases:1. C(>) = a, then we change > j to >k and denote the new profile >(cid:4). By monotonicity, we still have C(>(cid:4)) = a. This leadsto the contradiction that d j,k (cid:7)= k.2. Other cases where C(>) = b, c or other alternatives are similar to the case above.Therefore, we conclude that there are two distinct agents i, j such that Ci, j is non-dictatorial. (cid:2)For the base case again notice that the case for N = 1 is trivial, thus we need only to consider the case when thereare two agents and three alternatives. Again the number of all possible social choice functions is too large to enumerateexplicitly, but both our methods for verifying the base case in Arrow’s theorem can be adapted here. For the depth-firstsearch method, our program similarly reported that there are exactly two social choice functions that are weakly unanimousand monotonic, and both of them are dictatorial.One additional interesting thing to note is that it is also extremely fast to generate all the social choice functions thatsatisfy monotonicity only. There are 17 functions returned in total: 2 are dictatorships, 3 are constant and the remaining12 are all functions whose ranges contain 2 elements. Since a generalization of Muller–Satterthwaite theorem [16] says thatthe condition weak unanimity can be weakened by only requiring that the range contains at least 3 elements, these 12functions are the only interesting ones to look at when one wants to completely generalize the monotonicity condition.Notice that our proof outlined above parallels our earlier proof of Arrow’s theorem but does not make use of Arrow’stheorem. In contrast, the existing proofs such as those in [12,15,16] are more complicated and [12,15] rely on Arrow’stheorem.5. Sen’s theoremWe show in the following that our proof can also be copied to prove the impossibility theorem by Sen [20].Definition 9. A collective choice rule is a functional relationship F : Ln → R that specifies one and only one social preferencerelation r for any preference profile.The set R of preference relations includes all the possible binary relations. Particularly, the members of R are not neces-sarily transitive or complete. However, Sen focused only on social decision functions, a subset of collective choice rules withcertain restriction on R.Definition 10. A social decision function is a collective choice rule C : Ln → R such that for each r ∈ R, r should generate achoice function.A preference relation r should generate a “choice function” if according to r, there exists a best alternative in everysubset of alternatives. In other words, there exists an alternative that is at least as preferred as any other alternative in thatsubset.Sen then suggested three conditions which should be satisfied by any rational social decision function, namely unre-stricted domain (condition U ), unanimity (condition P , named after Pareto principle) and liberalism (condition L).The first two conditions are mentioned explicitly or implicitly in Arrow’s framework: unrestricted domain says that allthe possible preference profiles should be included in the domain of a social decision function while unanimity is exactlythe same one as in Arrow’s theorem.The third condition, liberalism, is somewhat debatable. The intuitive justification behind is that each individual has thefreedom to determine at least one social choice. For example, I should feel free to have my own garden planted lily ratherthan rose.Definition 11 (Liberalism). For each individual i, there is at least one pair of alternatives, say (a1, a2), such that this individualis decisive for (a1, a2).22 i is decisive for (a1, a2) if i prefers a1 to a2 implies that a1 is preferred to a2 according to the social preference relation returned by the decisionfunction.1048P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053Theorem 3 (Sen’s theorem [20]). There is no social decision function that can simultaneously satisfy U , P and L.Sen further weakened the condition L to be the following form L∗,Definition 12 (Liberalism*). There are at least two individuals such that for each of them there is at least one pair ofalternatives over which he is decisive.In other words, condition L∗only guarantees the freedom for two individuals instead of everyone in the society, asrequired by condition L. The following theorem subsumes Theorem 3.Theorem 4 (Sen’s theorem [20]). There is no social decision function that can simultaneously satisfy conditions U , P , and Lvoting model with |N| (cid:2) 2 and |O | (cid:2) 3.∗, for anyWe prove in the following Theorem 4. The inductive step consists of the following two lemmasLemma 5. If there is a social decision function for m + 1 alternatives and n outcomes that satisfies U, P and Ldecision function for m outcomes and n individuals that satisfies these three conditions as well, for all m (cid:2) 4.∗, then there is a socialProof. Let (N, O ) be a voting model such that |N| = n and |O | = m + 1, and C a social decision function that satisfies thethree conditions in the lemma. For any a ∈ O , we define Ca to be a function that is the “restriction” of C on O −a: for anypreference profile > of O −a, Ca(>) = C(>+a)−a.• Ca is still a social decision function. Since C is a social decision function, so the range of C is the set of preferences thatcan generate a choice function. That is, for any subset of outcomes, there is a best outcome. This outcome will still bethe best after we restrict on Ca since a is less preferred than any other outcome by unanimity.• The property of U and P of Ca follows directly from that of C .• Since C satisfies L∗|m + 1| (cid:2) 5, we can find an element a5 that is not in {a1, a2, a3, a4}. Now we can see that Ca5 still satisfies Lthe two decisive individuals are still decisive for their pairs of alternatives (a1, a2) and (a3, a4). (cid:2), we can always find two individuals and their decisive pairs (a1, a2) and (a3, a4) respectively. Sincebecause∗Lemma 6. If there is a social decision function for m alternatives and n + 1 outcomes that satisfies U, P and Ldecision function for m outcomes and n individuals that satisfies these three conditions as well, for all n (cid:2) 2.∗, then there is a social∗of C , we have two individuals j, k that are decisive for their own pair of outcomes. We can alsoProof. By the property Lfind another distinct agent i, since there are at least 2 + 1 three individuals for C . We now define Ci, j to be the followingsocial welfare function for (N−i, O ): for any preference profile > of (N, O ), Ci, j(>−i) = C(>−i, > j). Then Ci, j is still a socialdecision function and all the three properties follows directly from that of C . (cid:2)Notice that we have m (cid:2) 4 in Lemma 5, so the base case for Sen’s theorem is |N| = 2 and |O | = 3, 4. We can still checkit by our depth-first search algorithm, which we do not want to repeat here.6. Discovering new theoremsWe have been advocating a methodology of theorem discovering using computers [10,11]. The basic idea is to look forconjectures that are true in small domains using computers. Once we find such a conjecture, we then hope it to be true ingeneral. In the following, we present a new theorem discovered this way.6.1. An observation in small domainRecall that in our CSP formulation of the base case of Arrow’s theorem, constraints are the instantiations of both IIAand Unanimity conditions. Using the same algorithm, we can generate all the functions that satisfies IIA by restricting theconstraints to be the instantiations of IIA only.To our surprise (not so surprised if one is familiar with Wilson’s theorem [22], which will be introduced later in thissection), among the total 636 social welfare functions, they are only 94 of them satisfying IIA. This seems to suggest thatthe impossibility in Arrow’s theorem is actually not caused by the conflict between unanimity and IIA but mostly by IIA,which is too strong for a social welfare function to satisfy.Among these 94 functions, 2 of them are dictatorial, 2 of them are inversely dictatorial which means the social orderof the function is always opposite to someone’s individual order, and each of the remaining 90 functions has at most twovalues in the range. Of course among the 90 functions, there are 6 constant functions, each of which has exactly one value.Moreover, for any of the remaining 84 functions which have two different values, the distance between these values is atP. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–10531049most one pair of outcomes. For example, if one value is a1 >W a2 >W a3, then the other value can only be a2 >W a1 >W a3or a1 >W a3 >W a2.Definition 13. An agent i is a inverse dictator in W if for all alternatives a1 and a2, a1 >W a2 iff a2 >i a1. If there is a inversedictator in W , then it is said to be inversely dictatorial.Definition 14. The (Kendall tau) distance of two orderings on O is the number of pairs of outcomes where two orderingsdisagree.When IIA holds for a function W , we can define from it a social welfare function W Y : LnYan arbitrary non-empty subset Y of O , where LY is the restriction of L on Y and for any profile >(cid:4) ∈ Lnfor any > ∈ Ln such that >Y = >(cid:4).→ LY , the restriction of W onY , W Y (>(cid:4)) = W (>)Y ,We then generalize the above observation in small domain into the following theorem.Theorem 5. If a social welfare function W on (N, O ) satisfies IIA, then for every subset Y of O such that |Y | = 3,1. W Y is dictatorial, or2. W Y is inversely dictatorial, or3. The range of W Y has at most 2 elements, whose the distance is at most 1.Notice that 1–3 are pairwise disjoint. Fortunately, by observation we have already proved the base case for Theorem 5.Lemma 7. If a social welfare function W on (N, O ) where |N| = 2, |O | = 3 satisfies IIA,1. W is dictatorial, or2. W is inversely dictatorial, or3. The range of W has at most 2 elements, whose distance is at most 1.We show in the following the inductive step hold for this theorem too.6.2. The inductive stepWe first prove the following lemma that translates dictatorship to unanimity and translates inverse dictatorship to inverseunanimity under IIA.Definition 15. A social welfare function W is inversely unanimous (inversely Pareto efficient) if for all alternatives a1 and a2,we have that if a1 >i a2 for all agent i, then a2 >W a1Lemma 8. If a social welfare function W on (N, O ) where |O | (cid:2) 3 satisfies IIA, then1. W is dictatorial iff W is unanimous;2. W is inversely dictatorial iff W is inversely unanimous.Proof. Assuming IIA,1. if W is unanimous, by Arrow’s theorem, it is dictatorial; if W is dictatorial, by the definition of unanimity, it is unani-mous.2. Now if W is inversely dictatorial, but W is not inversely unanimous, we can construct a new function Wsuch thata >W b iff b >W (cid:4) a for any (a, b) and any preference profile >. We can see that Wsatisfies IIA and dictatorial, butnot unanimity. This contradicts to what we have proved above; similarly, if W is inversely unanimous but not in-that satisfies IIA and unanimity but not dictatorial, violating Arrow’sversely dictatorial, we can construct the same Wtheorem. (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)By the following lemma, together with Lemma 8, we can extend Lemma 7 to voting models with any number of agents.Lemma 9. If there is a social welfare function for n + 1 individuals and 3 outcomes that is IIA, but not unanimous or inverselyunanimous and its range has two elements whose distance is at least 2, then there is a social welfare function for n individuals and 3outcomes that is IIA, but not unanimous or inversely unanimous and its range has two elements whose distance is at least 2 as well.1050P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053Proof. Let N = {1, . . . , n, n + 1} be a set of agents, and O = {a, b, c} a set of 3 alternatives, and W a social welfare functionfor (N, O ) that satisfies the four conditions in the lemma. The same as before, for any i (cid:7)= j ∈ N, we define W i, j to bethe following social welfare function for (N−i, O ): for any preference profile > of (N, O ), W i, j(>−i) = W (>−i, > j), where(>−i, > j) is the result of replacing >i in > by > j . Clearly, for any i, j, W i, j is IIA, not unanimous or inversely unanimousbecause W satisfies these three conditions. We now show that we can find two distinct agent i, j such that the range ofW i, j has two elements whose distance is at least 2.Since there exist two preference profiles > and >(cid:4)such that W (>) differs from W (>(cid:4)) in at least two pair of outcomes,say (a, b) and (a, c). Since W is IIA, its restrictions W {a,b} and W {a,c} are well defined. Now we consider W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a >b), W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a), W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) and W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a). There are four cases as follows:1. W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) (cid:7)= W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a) and W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) (cid:7)= W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a). Without lossof generality, we suppose W (>) agrees with W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) in (a, b) and agrees with W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c)in (a, c), therefore W (>(cid:4)) agrees with W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a) in (a, b) and agrees with W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a) in(a, c). Now we consider a profile >(cid:4)(cid:4) = (a > b > c, . . . , a > b > c), clearly W (>) agrees with W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)) in (a, b), (a, c);similarly, for >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) = (c > b > a, . . . , c > b > a), W (>(cid:4)) agrees with W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)) in (a, b), (a, c). So W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)) and W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)) differin (a, b), (a, c). For two profiles >(cid:4)(cid:4)−i , their values of W i, j differ in (a, b), (a, c) for any j.2. W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) = W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a) and W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) (cid:7)= W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a). Without loss ofgenerality, we suppose W (>) agrees with W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) in (a, b) and agrees with W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) in(a, c), therefore W (>(cid:4)) agrees with W (c > a, . . . , c > a) in (a, c). Now we consider a profile >(cid:4)(cid:4)= (a > b > c, . . . , a > b >c), clearly W (>) agrees with W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)) in (a, b), (a, c); we can also construct another profile >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)has c > aon (a, b) for each agent. So W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)) and W (>(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)) differ in (a, b), (a, c). Now we lookfor each agent and >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)at the relation of (a, b) in >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4), since there are at least 3 agents, we can always find two agents, say i, j that agree on(a, b). For profiles >(cid:4)(cid:4)−i , their values of W i, j differ in (a, b), (a, c).3. W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) (cid:7)= W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a) and W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) = W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a). This case issuch that >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)−i , >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)−i , >(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)with >(cid:4)similar to case 2 above.4. W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) = W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a) and W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) = W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a). In this case,we first show that there exist two profiles >1 and >2 such that W (>1) and W (>2) differ in (b, c). We construct >1in such a way that >1 agrees with either > or >(cid:4)W a and >1 agrees with either> or >(cid:4)W c. Similarly, we can construct >2 sothat c >2W b. In this way, W (>1) and W (>2) differ in (a, b), (b, c), (a, c). Now we consider further W {b,c}(c >b, . . . , c > b) and W {b,c}(b > c, . . . , b > c). There are two cases:• W {b,c}(c > b, . . . , c > b) (cid:7)= W {b,c}(b > c, . . . , b > c), then this case will still be case 2 by considering (a, b), (b, c) in-in (a, c) for each player so that a >1W a >2in (a, b) for each player so that b >1W c. Therefore, we have b >1W a >1stead.• W {b,c}(c > b, . . . , c > b) = W {b,c}(b > c, . . . , b > c). We prove in the following that this case is impossible. SupposeW (a > b > c, . . . , a > b > c) = o1 > o2 > o3 where (o1, o2, o3) is a permutation of (a, b, c). Now we construct a newprofile >∗agrees with either >1 or >2 in (o1, o3)for each player so that o3 W (>∗)o1. But since o2 is always on top such that we have o1 W (>∗)o2 and o2 W (>∗)o3 because W {a,b}(a > b, . . . , a > b) = W {a,b}(b > a, . . . , b > a), W {a,c}(a > c, . . . , a > c) = W {a,c}(c > a, . . . , c > a) andW {b,c}(c > b, . . . , c > b) = W {b,c}(b > c, . . . , b > c). By transitivity, we have o1 W (>∗)o3, which is a contradiction. (cid:2)where o2 is always on top of each agent’s preference and >∗Since W is IIA, its restriction on any non-empty subset Y of |O | is still IIA. Therefore our Theorem 5 follows fromLemmas 7, 8 and 9. Note that Theorem 5 is closely related to several existing results (see e.g. [22] Theorem 5, aka Wilson’spartition lemma).6.3. The implication of the new theoremWe show in the following how to use Theorem 5 to prove two existing theorems.6.3.1. A brief proof of Arrow’s theoremOne immediate implication of Theorem 5 is Arrow’s theorem. Given that a social welfare function W on (O , N) is IIA, byapplying Theorem 5, we know W Y is either of the three cases when Y ⊆ |O |, |Y | = 3. If W is further unanimous assumedby Arrow’s theorem, so is W Y . Clearly W Y can only be case 1 for any Y . In other words, The restriction of W on any three-element subset is dictatorial. Now we arbitrarily choose such a Y = {a1, a2, a3}, suppose the dictator in W Y is i. Then i willstill be a dictator in W Y 1 , where Y 1 = {a1, a2, a4} for any a4 ∈ O \ Y , since there can only be one agent that is decisive forthe pair (a1, a2). Similarly, i is still the dictator for W Y 2 , where Y 2 = {a1, a3, a4} or {a2, a3, a4}, {a1, a4, a5} or {a4, a5, a6} forany distinct a5, a6. Therefore, we prove that all the restrictions of W on three-elements subset have a common dictator i.Since i is decisive for any pair in O 2, i is a dictator in W .6.3.2. A brief proof of Wilson’s theoremThere have been fruitful researches on relaxing the unanimity condition in Arrow’s framework. In other words, theseresearches also aim at finding the implication of IIA condition. One of the most famous one is Wilson’s theorem [22]. It statesP. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–10531051that even with a condition called nonimposition that is much weaker than unanimity, IIA can already imply dictatorship orinverse dictatorship.Definition 16. A social welfare function W is nonimposition if for all distinct alternatives a1 and a2, there exists a preferenceprofile > such that a1 >W a2Theorem 6 (Wilson’s theorem [22]). For any voting model (N, O ), if |O | (cid:2) 3, then any social welfare function that satisfies nonimpo-sition and IIA is either dictatorial or inversely dictatorial.Theorem 5 also implies Wilson’ theorem as well. Given that a social welfare function W on (O , N) is IIA, by applyingTheorem 5, we know W Y is either of the three cases when Y ⊆ |O |, |Y | = 3. If W is further nonimposition assumed byWilson’s theorem, so is W Y . Therefore W Y can only be dictatorial or inversely dictatorial since case 3 in Theorem 5 obvi-ously violates nonimposition. Dictatorship or inverse dictatorship then follows from similar arguments to those of Arrow’stheorem above.7. A logical language for social choice theoryAs we mentioned earlier, we are not only interested in alternative proofs of existing theorems or even the manualdiscovery of new theorem like what we did in Section 5. Our long term goal is to automate the discovery of theorems insocial choice theory, game theory, and others [10,11]. One insight of our new proofs is that these known impossibility resultsare all rooted in some small base cases. Thus by experimenting with other conditions in small cases, we could discover somenew results. To fully automate the enumeration and verification process of these conditions, we propose a logical languagefor social choice theory.3This language is a variant of the situation calculus [13,17], one of the best known languages in AI. For representingArrow’s theorem, we use two predicates: p(x, a, b, s) (in the situation s, agent x prefers a over b) and w(a, b, s) (in thesituation s, a is preferred over b according to the social welfare function). The intuition is that in each situation, there is apreference ordering for each player (represented by predicate p), and a social welfare function for the society (predicate w).The requirement that the preferences be linear corresponds to the following axioms:p(x, a, b, s) ∨ p(x, b, a, s) ∨ a = b,¬p(x, a, a, s) ∧ ¬w(a, a, s),p(x, a, b, s) ∧ p(x, b, c, s) ⊃ p(x, a, c, s),w(a, b, s) ∨ w(b, a, s) ∨ a = b,w(a, b, s) ∧ w(b, c, s) ⊃ w(a, c, s),(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)where “⊃” is the logical implication operator. We have used the convention that all free variables in a formula are implicitlyuniversally quantified from outside unless stated otherwise. So the full sentence for the first axiom above is:∀x, a, b, s.p(x, a, b, s) ∨ p(x, b, a, s) ∨ a = b.We also need an axiom which says that the predicate w indeed represents a function that aggregates individual preferences:[∀x, a, b.p(x, a, b, s1) ≡ p(x, a, b, s2)] ⊃ [∀a, b.w(a, b, s1) ≡ w(a, b, s2)].The unanimity condition corresponds to the following axiom:∀a, b, s.[∀x p(x, a, b, s)] ⊃ w(a, b, s),the non-dictatorship condition the following axiom:¬∃x∀s, a, b.p(x, a, b, s) ≡ w(a, b, s),and the IIA condition the following one:∀a, b, s1, s2.[∀x.p(x, a, b, s1) ≡ p(x, a, b, s2)] ⊃ [w(a, b, s1) ≡ w(a, b, s2)].(9)(10)(11)(12)3 In fact, there has been some work on encoding Arrow’s axiom system in temporal logic. For example, [1] presented a logic that included Arrow’stheorem as a theorem in the logic. However, we propose the new logic language mainly because of its simplicity in syntax and semantics as well as itsimmediate translation to propositional logic for fast implementation by SAT.1052P. Tang, F. Lin / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1041–1053Furthermore, we need to say that each preference profile is represented by some situation (the assumption of unrestricteddomain). One way to do it is to introduce an action swap(x, a, b) which when performed will swap the positions of a andb in agent x’s preference ordering.p(x, a, b, do(swap(x, a, b), s)) ≡ p(x, b, a, s),where in general, do( A, s) denotes the situation resulting from doing action A in s. We also need other axioms to say thatin the new situation, agent x prefers aoverb before, that this action has no effects on the orderings of other pairs of alternatives, and no effect on the preferenceorderings of other agents. All these can be conveniently specified using Reiter’s successor state axioms [17]:over a before, she prefers aover b iff she prefers aover a iff she prefers a(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)p(x, a, b, do(swap( y, a1, b1), s)) ≡ p(x, a, b, s) ∧ [x (cid:7)= y ∨ (a (cid:7)= a1 ∧ a (cid:7)= b1 ∧ b (cid:7)= a1 ∧ b (cid:7)= b1)] ∨x = y ∧ a = a1 ∧ b = b1 ∧ p(x, b, a, s) ∨x = y ∧ a = a1 ∧ b (cid:7)= b1 ∧ b (cid:7)= a ∧ p(x, b1, b, s) ∨x = y ∧ b = b1 ∧ a (cid:7)= a1 ∧ b (cid:7)= a ∧ p(x, a, a1, s).This way, given an initial situation S0 that encodes any preference profile, we can get any other preference profile byperforming a sequence of swapping actions in S0.However, if we are given a specific voting model, we can name each preference profile explicitly by a situation constant.For instance, for the voting model ({1, 2}, {a, b, c}) corresponding to the base case in our proof of Arrow’s theorem, there are36 different profiles, so we introduce 36 situation constants S1, . . . , S36, and add axioms like the following ones to definethem:p(1, a, b, S1) ∧ p(1, a, c, S1) ∧ p(1, b, c, S1),p(2, a, b, S1) ∧ p(2, a, c, S1) ∧ p(2, b, c, S1).In fact, this is what we did for using a SAT solver to verify the base case in our inductive proof of Arrow’s theorem. Weinstantiated the axioms (10)–(12) as well as the general axioms about p and w on ({1, 2}, {a, b, c}), and converted themas well as the axioms like the above ones for the 36 situation constants to clauses. The resulting set of clauses has 35973variables and 106354 clauses, and we were surprised that the SAT solver Chaff2 [14] returned in less than 1 second whenrun on our AMD server machine and confirmed that the set of clauses has no models.8. Conclusion and future workWe have given a new proof of Arrow’s theorem. The basic idea is extremely simple: use induction to reduce it to thebase case which is then verified using computers. One remarkable thing about it is that it appears to be a very generalapproach for proving other theorems in the area. In fact, we have adapted it almost straightforwardly to proving two otherwell-known theorems of the same nature, one by Muller and Satterthwaite and the other by Sen.One insight we have obtained from the proof is that theorems that are verified to be true in the small base cases areextremely likely to be true in general. That is how we have discovered and proved our new theorem in Section 6.If all these axioms in social choice theory can be checked in base case as fast as those in Arrow’s theorem, an interestingfuture work is to verify all the possible combinations of these candidate axioms using a computer program and then try toextend the survivors to general case using the “two-lemma trick” introduced in the inductive step. To facilitate the abovesystematical generation and verification process, it becomes nature to describe these axioms in a logical language thatis easy in syntax and semantics as well as allows for fast implementation. That is why we have proposed a new logicalformalism for social choice theory despite the rich literature. In fact, we did discover this way two theorems, as describedin [6]. It is pity that both theorems can be implied immediately by existing theorems. We are still exploring this territoryto see if we could come up with something new.In a recent note [5] in celebration of John Nash’s 80th birthday, Binmore remarked,Nash was not shy of taking his ideas to the big names in the academic world. He famously proposed a scheme forreinterpreting quantum theory to Albert Einstein, who responded by suggesting that he first learn some physics. It isunfortunate that Nash got similar treatment from Von Neumann, when he showed him his existence theorem . . .We are not shy of taking our ideas to those big names either, and we get computers to help us.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, especially the one that exposed us to Suzu-mura’s induction proof.
