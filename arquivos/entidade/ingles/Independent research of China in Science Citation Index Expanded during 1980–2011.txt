The  core  categories  included  multi-disciplinary  chemistry,  physical  chemistry,  multidisciplinary  materials  science,  and  appliedphysics. Moreover,  China’s  performance  of  nanotechnology  and  science,  especially  carbonnanotubes,  nanoparticles,  nanowires,  and nanostructures  showed  dramatic  growth.  Six  toparticles  with  at  least  1000  citations  were  examined,  and  were  observed  to concern  medicine,nanotube,  and  adsorption.  In  addition,  main  contributing  institutions  and  authors  were  alsorevealed  and  evaluated.  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences  played  a  dominant  role,  and  TsinghuaUniversity,  Peking  University  and  five  universities  in  Hong  Kong  showed  good  scientificperformance.© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionChina has adopted the reform and opening-up policy for global competition and collaboration for more than 30 years,and it has moved into the front ranks in science and technology (Mervis, 2010). Especially during nearly two  decades, China’sinternational collaboration measured by scientific publications has been increased significantly, not only in Chinese Scienceand Technology Papers and Citations Database (Wang, Zhuang, Peng, & Li, 2005; Wang, Wu,  Pan, Ma,  & Rousseau, 2005), butalso in the Science Citation Index Expanded (Zhou & Glänzel, 2010). Collaboration of publication between China and the sevenmajor industrialized countries (G7) (Canada, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA) has also shown exponentialgrowth (He, 2009). Such collaboration had positive effects on increasing the quantity of publication in China (Cho, Hu, &∗Corresponding author at: Trend Research Centre, Asia University, No. 500, Lioufeng Road, Wufeng, Taichung County 41354, Taiwan.Tel.:  +886 4 2332 3456x1797; fax: +886 4 2330 5834.E-mail address: ysho@asia.edu.tw (Y.-S.

Ho / Journal of Informetrics 7 (2013) 210– 222211Liu, 2010). While collaboration, in the form of technology acquisition could enhance the low-and-medium technology (Du& Tan, 2010), there is a question concerning China’s ability to conduct independent and high quality scientific research.Recently, top cited articles have been employed to reveal the recognition of scientific advancement and to give a historicperspective on the scientific progress (Baltussen & Kindler, 2004; Ohba, Nakao, Isashiki, & Ohba, 2007). Top cited articleswere also considered as “classic citations” (Garfield, 1987). Various studies have attempted to identify and analyze the“citation classics”, especially in medical fields, such as leading dermatologic journals (Dubin, Hafner, & Arndt, 1993), andophthalmology journals (Ohba et al., 2007). Bibliometric method as a common research tool has been widely used to measurethe scientific performance of countries, such as China (Zhang & Zhang, 1997), Croatia (Klai ´c & Klai ´c, 1997), EU countries(Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2006), Japan (Fukui & Rahman, 2002), and New Zealand (Pon, Carroll, & Mcghee, 2004). Analysesusually covered the distribution of publication output, science disciplines, contributing institutions, collaboration (Jeenah& Pouris, 2008; Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2006), as well as policy implication (Uthman & Uthman, 2007). Furthermore, thecitation life cycles of most cited papers with significant influence were revealed to provide more detail citation information(Fu, Wang, & Ho, 2012). In recent years, the frequency of words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus in successivesub-periods have been quantitatively analyzed to figure out the research emphases and trends (Ho, Satoh, & Lin, 2010; Li,Zhang, Wang, & Ho, 2009).The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze top cited papers contributed independently by China in the ScienceCitation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) database from 1980 to 2011. The analysis covers annual production, field perfor-mance, research emphases, top articles, contributing institutions and authors. Some newly developed indicators related totitle words, author keywords, KeyWords Plus, first author, and corresponding author were employed to provide additionalinsights.2. Methodology2.1. Data collectionChina’s overall publication performance was revealed from 1980 to 2011, since the beginning for its rapid developmentaccording to its policy of reform and opening to the outside world. Previous research showed that G7 countries dominatedin some topics in recent decades, such as meteorology, atmospheric science, and water research (Li et al., 2009; Wang, Yu,& Ho, 2010). In this study, China’s publication output was examined in comparison with G7 countries. The annual numberof articles by China and G7 countries was obtained from SCI-Expanded database of the Thomson Reuters Web  of Scienceduring 1980–2011. China, the United Kingdom (UK), and Germany were searched by more than one item. China, Hong Kong,and Macao were searched in terms of address for China; articles originating from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, andWales were reclassified as being from the United Kingdom (UK); and German Democratic Republic (Ger Dem Rep), FederalRepublic of Germany (Fed Rep Ger), and Germany were reclassified as being from Germany.To analyze China’s independent publication performances, the independent top cited publications of China without anyinternational collaboration were abstracted. The data collection process of China’s independent publications is illustratedin Fig. 1. First, China, Hong Kong, and Macao were searched in terms of address within the publication year limitation from1980 to 2011 based on SCI-Expanded (updated on 11 July 2012). A total of 1,343,756 documents in 21 document types weretherefore found. Second, only the document type of “article” (1,170,899), excluding “proceedings paper”, “book chapter”, and“book”, was considered, since they represented the majority of document types that also included whole research ideas andresults (Ho et al., 2010). Third, articles that have an author address from another country, other than China, were all excluded.The number of independent articles was 907,259. The total number of times an article was  cited from its publication to 2011was recorded as TC2011 (Chuang, Wang, & Ho, 2011; Wang, Li, & Ho, 2011). The advantage of TC2011 is that it is an invariantparameter, thus ensuring repeatability, while the index of citation would have been updated from time to time (Fu et al.,2012). Since Garfield (1987) introduced the top cited articles as citation classics in 1987, articles that were cited at least100 times were previously discussed as citation classics (Dubin et al., 1993; Gehanno, Takahashi, Darmoni, & Weber, 2007;Heldwein, Rhoden, & Morgentaler, 2010; Nieri et al., 2007). As the result, 2701 articles (3.0% of 907,259 articles) qualify astop cited articles with TC2011  100.≥Since not all articles had information of both first author and corresponding author, only articles with both first author andcorresponding author information were used to evaluate the performance of authors and institutions. In instances of single-author articles, the author was considered as the first author, as well as the corresponding author.

Analytic structure of characteristics of China’s independent research.and institution were independently generated, and therefore the quantity with information of author and institution wasnot equal. After these pretreatments, there were 2581 articles with both first author and corresponding author informationamong 2701 top cited articles. Altogether 2673 articles had the affiliation information of both first author and correspondingauthor for institution analysis.2.2. Structure and indicatorsThis study, not only compared China with G7 countries, but also looked at independent research of China by itself(Fig. 2). The annual production, favored categories, research emphases and trends by the frequency of keywords, the typicaltop articles, major individual and institutional contributors of China were presented subsequently. Publication outputsindicators, number of articles (TP) and publication share (%) as well as citation indicators, TC2011 and total TC2011 per article(CTPP)  were used. Impact factor of journal, ranking, and frequency of keywords were also employed. The word share ofeach country was obtained by dividing number of one country’s articles by the total number of articles in the world for thecomparison with G7. As for the analysis of authors and institutions, more indicators were used to obtain more characteristics.Collaboration type was determined by the affiliations of the authors. (1) The term “single institution article” was assignedif the researchers’ affiliation were from the same institution. (2) The term “inter-institutionally collaborative article” wasassigned if authors were from different institutions in China. (3) The term “first author article” was  assigned if the firstauthor was from the institution for analysis. (4) The term “corresponding author article” was  assigned if the correspondingauthor was from the institution for analysis. An article could either be a single institution article or inter-institutionallycollaborative article. However, with respect to a given institution or author, the first author and the corresponding authorof one article might be the same person, and the first author and corresponding author might be affiliated to the sameinstitution. An article might be both first author article and corresponding author article of the given institution or author,and thereby belonging to two sets of target articles. Total number of publications (TP), single institution articles (SP), inter-institutionally collaborative articles (CP), first author’s articles (FP), and corresponding author’s articles (RP) were examinedto assess Chinese institutions and authors.Another newly developed indicator Y-index (j, (cid:2)), first proposed in 2012 (Ho, 2012a),  was utilized to evaluate Chineseinstitutions and authors. Y-index provides a single index to identify important characteristics related to first author andcorresponding author which could not be obtained by other traditional indicators (Ho, 2012b). This index is related tonumbers of first author publications (FP)  and corresponding author publications (RP), as defined:(cid:2)j=FP2 +(cid:3)(cid:2)= tan−1RP2(cid:4)RPFP(1)(2)(cid:2) stand for different proportions of corresponding author publications to first author publications. where, j is the publication performance constant related to publication quantity, and  is the publication character whichcan describe the proportion of FP to RP.  The greater j is, the more contribution the analyzed unit makes. Different values > 0.7854 meansof more corresponding author publications; (cid:2) = 0.7854 means the same quantity of first author publications and correspondingauthor publications; 0 <  = 0, j = number of first author publicationsand ∞,  j = number of corresponding author publications. < 0.7854 means more first author publications.

Comparison of China and seven industrial countries from 1980 to 2011.3. Results and discussion3.1. Comparison of China and G7Fig. 3 shows that G7 countries published the majority of articles from 1980 to 2011, but their world share of articlesshowed a decreasing trend from 67% in 1980 to 53% in 2011. USA was  the overwhelming leader in terms of total scientificoutputs. The number of articles by the USA increased from 128,059 in 1980 to 282,579 in 2011, although its world share fellfrom 34% in 1980 to 26% in 2011. The other six countries, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy all showed increasingtrends, with the world share of 8.1%, 8.0%, 7.9%, 5.8%, 4.5%, and 3.6% in 2011, respectively. Among them, Italy had the greatestgrowth rate among these seven countries. Its world share climbed from the lowest world share 2.2% to 4.3%. Comparatively,China soared from 1029 in 1980 to 152,856 articles in 2011, increased by 148 times and made up about 14% of world shareof articles in 2011. The great growth rate of China might be one of the reasons for the six countries of G7 decreases of worldshare. After Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), scientific research papers of China grew exponentially (Frame & Narin, 1987).China’s science was in a quantitative expansion phase with exponential growth (Jin & Rousseau, 2005). China’s becomethe second since 2006 in scientific production, only behind the USA, leaving other G7 countries behind (ISTIC, 2007, 2011;Leydesdorff & Wagner, 2009). It is no coincidence that large funding has fueled research performance in China (Zhou &Leydesdorff, 2006). The Chinese government focused on science and technology by substantially increasing the expenditureon research and development as a percentage of GDP, from 0.8% in 1999 to 1.7% by 2008, according to the 2012 edition ofScience and Engineering Indicators (www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei). The increase in scientific work force has also contributed a lot tothis growth of science production (Mervis, 2010).3.2. Characteristics of annual publications≥The annual top cited articles with TC2011  100 contributed independently by China are displayed in Fig. 4. The top citedarticles has been rising steadily since 1991, reaching a peak of 318 articles in 2003, and then declined. The low level of China’soutput of scientific literature in 1980s was possible reflected by the Cultural Revolution (Frame & Narin, 1987). The increaseof articles from 1991 to 2003 suggested that not only did China’s total outputs increase, but also its production level of topcited classics has been advanced. Nearly 74% top cited articles were published in 2000s, similar to the trend of all articles,which enforces the view that China’s scientific activities have been strengthened in recent years. The decline of 2003–2010might be explained in part by the less time for their articles to accumulate citations (Picknett & Davis, 1999). The decline ofoutput of top cited articles in recent years has been observed in previous studies (Fu, Chuang, Wang, & Ho, 2011; Ho, 2012a)due to time needed for citations.The 2701 articles received a total of 443,296 citations, with an average of 164 citations per article. In terms of TC2011,2230 articles (83%) received 100–200 citations each; 425 articles (16%) received 201–500 citations each; 40 articles (1.5%)received 501–1000 citations each; and only six articles received at least 1000 citations each. The part of 100–200 citationstook a large proportion of more than four fifths. As for annual publications, 30 of these 32 years’ had 100–200 CTPPs, while     214H.-Z. Fu, Y.-S.

Top cited articles (TC2011 ≥ 100) from 1980 to 2011.only 2 year: 1988 and 1983 had CTPPs  more than 200. This phenomenon might be attributed to the low production in 1980s.Another reason for 1988 with the highest CTPP of 271 may  be two heavily cited articles titled “use of all-trans retinoicacid in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia” (Huang et al., 1988) with TC2011 = 1594, and “the glucose-oxidasedab nickel method in peroxidase histochemistry of the nervous-system” (Shu, Ju, & Fan, 1988) with TC2011 = 1030. Afterremoving these two articles, the new 1988 CTPP value was 161, much less than the original 1988 CTPP value of 271. Oneprevious study stated the impact of China’s science was low, and needs to enhance its quality (Jin & Rousseau, 2005).3.3. Web  of Science categoriesAccording to Journal Citation Reports (JCR) science edition, there were 176 Web  of Science categories in 2011. The topcited articles were published across 140 Web  of Science categories. Basic sciences, such as physics and chemistry, covered23 categories with 1737 articles, occupying 64% of total top cited articles. In particular, 13 chemistry related categorieswith 1269 articles took nearly a half of the total articles. Another 13 categories in physics had 973 articles, made up about36%, fewer than those in chemistry. The excellent performance of chemistry was  also not surprising since China has takena leading position in publishing journal papers in chemistry during 1998–2007 (Zhou & Leydesdorff, 2009). Among thesecategories, 14 categories were assigned to engineering with 304 articles, comprising 11% of total articles. Similarly, naturalscience has been investigated to take approximately three fifths, and field of engineering comprised approximately 15% inChina’s publications (Mervis, 2010). Physics, chemistry, and engineering in China had developed well in the last 30 years.In general, the categories can be classified into three groups, each producing about one-third of all articles. The categoriesof zone 1 could obviously be recognized as the core categories. Zone 1, representing the most productive third of the totalarticles, contained four categories (2.9%). Zone 2, representing the next most productive third of total articles, contained 16categories (11%). Zone 3, representing the least productive third of total articles, contained 120 categories (89%). The numberof categories in each zone were found to be proportional to 1:n:n2.5. The overall top 20 categories were listed in Table 1.The four core categories took no less than 10% of total articles each, and comprised 37% altogether. The core categorieswere multidisciplinary chemistry, physical chemistry, multidisciplinary materials science, and applied physics, which wasconsistent with China’s traditional research focus.3.4. Research emphases and trendsThe title and the author keywords, provides a reasonably detailed picture of the article’s theme. KeyWords Plus, generatedindependently of the title or author keywords go into far more detail, describing the article’s contents with greater depthand variety than only title and author keywords (Garfield, 1990). Statistical analysis of words in title, author keywords, andKeyWords Plus has been developed only in recent years, and has proved to be significant in monitoring the development ofscience and programs (Ho et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009). Including words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus together  H.-Z. Fu, Y.-S.

These kinds of words wereexamined by time periods to show the trends, as well as to minimize the year-to-year fluctuations. The 20 most frequentlyused words in title of four sub-periods (1980–1987, 1988–1995, 1996–2003, and 2004–2011) are listed in Table 2. In thetitle analysis, prepositions, such as “of” and other meaningless words were excluded. Among 2701 articles, only 950 articles(35%) had records information of author keywords, and 3111 author keywords were found. Altogether 2411 articles (89%)had records information of KeyWords Plus, and 7287 KeyWords Plus were then be analyzed from SCI-Expanded (Table 3).Interestingly, eleven words did not appear in the earliest period of 1980–1987 in Table 2, and seven of these eleven wordsincluding “nanotubes”, “nanoparticles”, “nanowires”, “networks”, “ZnO”, “photocatalytic”, and “oxide” emerged after 1995.Most frequently used words in title emerged in the latest 16 years (1996–2003 and 2004–2011) provided the evidencethat the China’s research has been more prosperous in recent years. “Synthesis” (244; 9.0%), “carbon” (140; 5.2%), and“nanotubes” (113; 4.2%) were the three most frequently used words in title. According to the results of author keywords, the3rd position “carbon nanotubes”, the “carbon” and “nanotubes” came together as “carbon nanotubes” in 78 articles’ titles.Three words: “nanotubes”, “nanoparticles”, and “nanowires” in the top six of the words in title, two words: “nanostructures”and “carbon nanotubes” in the top three author keywords, and the 1st place “nanoparticles” in the KeyWords Plus list wererelated to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, which suggested that China played better in this field than China’sother fields, based on the active performance of its basic science. There were 262 articles with nanotubes, nanoparticles ornanowires in their titles, having 101 articles in the category of physical chemistry, 78 in multidisciplinary chemistry, and74 in multidisciplinary materials science. The ascent of nanoscience in China has early been noticed in 2005 in Science (Bai,2005). China’s emerging presence in nanoscience was  compared with France, Germany, Japan, and the USA from 1985 to2004 (Guan & Ma,  2007), and was closing the gap with the USA during 1991–2005 (Kostoff, Koytcheff, & Lau, 2007). Itsnanotechnology publication activity has grown exponentially at an annual rate of about 20% from 2000 to 2009 (Ye, Liu, &Porter, 2012), and has already surpassed the USA since 2009 in terms of publications outputs (Kostoff, 2012).

As a academician of Chinese Academy of science Bai (2005) observed, when the conceptof nanoscience and nanotechnology was first introduced in the 1980s, it was  received favorably in China. In the 1990s,support for the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology increased substantially. It has also been reported thatState Science and Technology Commission launched the nearly decade-long “Climbing Up” project on nanomaterial sci-ence in 1990 (Bai, 2005). From 1990 to 2002, nearly 1000 related projects (with a total funding of about $27 million)were implemented. Tens of nation-wide conferences have been held in China since 1990 covering a wide range of topicsin the related fields (Bai, 2001). During this period, National Natural Science Foundation of China approved nearly 1000grants for small-scale projects (Bai, 2005). Some achievements were obtained according to these substantial supports. Fourtop cited article with TC2011 > 1000 were published in 1990s. Two  independent articles without any international collab-oration: “large-scale synthesis of aligned carbon nanotubes” (Li et al., 1996), and “synthesis of gallium nitride nanorodsthrough a carbon nanotube-confined reaction” (Han, Fan, Li, & Hu, 1997) were contributed by Chinese Academy Scienceand Tsinghua University, respectively. Another two international collaborative articles with TC2011 > 1000, “a chemicallyfunctionalizable nanoporous material [Cu3(TMA)2(H2O)3]n” (Chui, Lo, Charmant, Orpen, & Williams, 1999), and “hydrogenstorage in single-walled carbon nanotubes at room temperature” (Liu et al., 1999) was published by the collaboration withthe UK and USA, respectively. Furthermore, in 2000, National Steering Committee for Nanoscience and Nanotechnologywas created to oversee national policy and coordinate action (Bai, 2005). This committee drafted the first Chinese nationalpolicy document intended to promote nanotechnology development, which was announced as the National Nanotechnol-ogy Development Strategy (2001–2010) (Huang & Wu,  2012). Again, the article titled “piezoelectric nanogenerators basedon zinc oxide nanowire arrays” (Wang & Song, 2006) with TC2011 > 1000 was  published in 2006 by Georgia Institute ofTechnology in USA, Peking University and National Center for Nanoscience and Technology in China.In addition, “networks” (63; 2.3%), “stability” (60; 2.2%), “ZnO” (58; 2.1%), and “photocatalytic” (57; 2.1%) received increas-ing attention from no articles in 1980–1987 to no less than 2.6% articles in 2004–2011. Particularly, there were 58 articleswith “ZnO” which appeared in the titles together with the composite words related to nanometers including “nanostruc-tures”, “nanowire(s)”, “nanotubes”, and “nanorods” in more than a half articles, having 33 articles in the Web  of Sciencecategory of applied physics. This provides another evidence for China’s good performance in the category of applied physicsand the research hotspot of nanotechnology. There were 63 articles with “networks” in their titles, having 19 articles inmultidisciplinary physics, 17 articles in electrical and electronic engineering, and 14 articles in mathematical physics. Thewords “networks” in 38 articles appeared as “neural networks”. Neural networks, based on the study of the human brainwhich would have a prominent role in decision support (Cross, Harrison, & Kennedy, 1995) have a large appeal to Chineseresearchers. Moreover, for KeyWords Plus, the 3rd place “films” also got a high ranking of 8th in the analysis of title, andwas also mainly studied in the categories related to physics and chemistry.3.5. Characteristics of top articlesThe articles with the highest TC2011 can be considered the most popular articles in China’s independent research. Thepatterns of citation life cycles of top cited articles could provide the characteristics for the top articles (Aksnes, 2003). Thecitation life cycles of these articles of six top articles with TC2011  1000 are illustrated in Fig. 5. Two articles were publishedin 1980s, three in 1990s, and one in 2000s. These six articles were “Ho and McKay (1999)”  in biochemistry and molecular≥H.-Z. Fu, Y.-S. Ho / Journal of Informetrics 7 (2013) 210– 222217Ho and Mckay (1999), TC2011 = 1660Li et al.

(1997)” inmultidisciplinary sciences, “Huang et al. (1988)”  in hematology, “Peiris et al. (2003)”  in general and internal medicine, and“Shu et al. (1988)” in neurosciences. Except the most attractive article “Ho and McKay (1999)”  on adsorption in ProcessBiochemistry with impact factor (IF) = 2.627, three out of six articles “Huang et al. (1988)”, “Peiris et al. (2003)”, and “Shu et al.(1988)” related to medicine were published in Blood (IF = 9.898), Lancet (IF = 38.278), and Neuroscience Letters (IF = 2.105);and two articles “Li et al. (1996)” and “Han et al. (1997)”  about nanotubes were published in Science (IF = 31.201). Moreover,three articles were contributed independently by one institution. They were “Ho and McKay (1999)” in Hong Kong UniversityScience and Technology, “Han et al. (1997)” in Tsinghua University, and “Shu et al. (1988)”  in Fourth Military MedicalUniversity, respectively.The article “Ho and McKay (1999)” had the highest number of citations in 2011, as well as the steepest growth rate inrecent years. This article was cited 423 times in 2011, much more than other articles. The article was also the leader in termsof annual citations in 2011 in the category of chemical engineering (Ho, 2012a).  Ho and McKay (1999) reviewed the use ofsorbents and biosorbents to treat polluted aqueous effluents containing dyes: organics or metal, and proposed the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Since the introduction of pseudo-second-order model for the description of adsorption kineticsin 1999, it has been widely applied to the adsorption of pollutants from aqueous solutions (Ho, 2006; Wu,  Tseng, Huang,& Juang, 2009). Although the other five top articles got increasing attention after publication, the citations all had declinesafterwards. Huang et al. (1988) reported that all-trans retinoic acid was  an effective inducer for attaining complete remissionin acute promyelocytic leukemia. Shu et al. (1988) stated that a combination of the glucose oxidase diaminobenzidine (DAB)method and the DAB nickel method could successfully bring out details of immunoreactive structures in immunostainedpreparations. The latest article in 2003 from Peiris provided an evidence that a virus in the coronavirus family is the causalagent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003). It is also the highest cited article in the publicationyear of 2003 among these six top articles. SARS has become the major of health issues since its outbreak early 2003 in China.Li et al. (1996) discussed the large-scale synthesis of aligned carbon nanotubes in Science. Another article in Science, Han et al.(1997) suggested that it might be possible to synthesize other nitride nanorods through similar carbon nanotube-confinedreactions. It is noticeable that four authors Zhen-yi Wang, Sishen Xie, Shoushan Fan, and Gong Ju in these four articles wereacademicians of Chinese Academy of Engineering or Chinese Academy of Sciences. Wang in “Huang et al. (1988)”  has becomeacademician of Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1994; Sishen Xie in “Li et al. (1996)” and Shoushan Fan in “Han et al.(1997)” has become academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, and Gong Ju in “Shu et al. (1988)” has becomeacademician of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991. These four authors all became academicians after several years sincethe publication of the top articles, which indicated that the heavily cited articles could be considered important symbols forthe evaluation of research management.3.6. Institutional and individual contributorsThe author, as well as the affiliation of the author, listed in one publication could be considered as the evidence of contri-bution (Coats, 2009). Both the number of authors on a paper and their positions in the byline need to be taken into accountaccurately when measuring author contribution (Mattsson, Sundberg, & Laget, 2011). It has been accepted conventionally   218H.-Z. Fu, Y.-S.

The first author has actually made the most contribution, and should receive a greater proportionof the credit (Maruˇsi ´c et al., 2004; Reisenberg & Lundberg, 1990). Accordingly, the non-first authors made less contribution(Shapiro, Wenger, & Shapiro, 1994). As important as the first author, another prominent authorship position is the corre-sponding author. The honorary authors including Nobel laureates were more likely to be listed last authors on scientificpapers, rather than the first author (Bates, Ani ´c, Maruˇsi ´c, & Maruˇsi ´c, 2004; Zuckerman, 1968). The first author is commonlycontributed the most, but the corresponding author obviously increases the author’s credit for contributions to the study(Bhandari et al., 2004). Corresponding author was the one who  contributed the most to the initial conception and supervi-sion (Wren et al., 2007). Straight counting that accredits only the first or the corresponding author fractional counting thataccredits each collaborator with partial and weighted credit might be the better choices (Huang, Lin, & Chen, 2011). Y-index(cid:2)) (Ho, 2012a)  which takes the first author articles and corresponding author articles into consideration could provide(j, more fair information for evaluation of Chinese institutions and authors.(cid:2)≤≥≤ j < 10; 25 institutions 10  j < 30; and 20 institutions had j There were 474 institutions contributing to 2673 articles. Of these articles, 1821 articles (68%) came from independent(cid:2)), nearly a half of institutionsinstitution, 852 articles (32%) from inter-institutional collaboration. In terms of Y-index (j, (231) had no first author articles and corresponding articles. Among the remaining 243 institutions, a high percentage of = 0.7854 with the same number of first author articles and corresponding author articles. Withininstitutions (235; 97%) had respect to j, 198 institutions (82%) had 1  30, published 75% topcited articles. The top 20 institutions are listed in Table 4. The leading institution was the Chinese Academy of Scienceswith j = 841.5 (28% of total articles). Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is the China’s highest academic institution in naturalsciences, with the affiliated University of Science and Technology of China and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. CAShas dominated publications with a contribution around one fourth in other studies, such as total publications in 1981–1985(Arunachalam, Singh, & Sinha, 1993), and highly cited articles in 1999–2009 using Essential Science Indicators (Fu et al.,2011). However, a bias appeared because the Chinese Academy of Sciences has over 100 branches in different cities (Li et al.,2009). There are 113 institutions directly under CAS, including 92 research institutes (including three botanical gardens),six universities and supporting organizations (including two  universities, one supporting organization, one documentationand information unit, two news and publication units), 12 management organizations that consist of the headquarters andbranches, and three other units (www.cas.cn). The publications of different institutions were pooled as one heading now,and publications divided into branches would result in different rankings. Other than the Chinese Academy of Sciences, theother leading institutions were University of Hong Kong (j = 301.2), Chinese University of Hong Kong (j = 239.7), and TsinghuaUniversity (j = 207.2). In addition, the 2nd position University of Hong Kong ranked 2nd in inter-institutionally collaborativearticles, as well as the 2nd in the first author articles and corresponding author articles. Of the top 20 institutions, exceptfor five universities located in Hong Kong and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the other 14 productive universities wereall included in the “985 Project” of China. Project 985, a constructive project for founding world-class universities in the21st century conducted by the government of China with a huge funding injection, might be a boost for the well scientificperformance of these universities (Fu et al., 2011). China’s research and development funding was mainly conducted in itsuniversities (Zhou & Leydesdorff, 2006).As for author analysis, 2581 articles with the information of both first author and corresponding author were evaluatedby Y-index (Ho, 2012a).

Each dot was displayed with its Y-index (j, (j = 33.24), followed by Li (j = 31.14), and Cao (j = 24.84). The 1st place He from Donghua University published 24 first authorarticles and 23 corresponding author articles, twenty of which were conducted with single author. The most cited article ofHe with TC2011 = 681 was related to variational iteration method – a kind of non-linear analytical technique (He, 1999). Heis the only top author who had more first author articles than corresponding author articles ((cid:2) = 0.764). The 2nd position Lifrom Tsinghua University published three first author articles and 31 corresponding author articles. Li’s most popular articlewas entitled “a general strategy for nanocrystal synthesis” (TC2011 = 826) in Nature (Wang, Zhuang, et al., 2005; Wang, Wu,et al., 2005). The 3rd ranking Cao from Southeast University published 16 first author articles and 19 corresponding authorarticles. The most heavily cited article of Cao concerned about global stability conditions for delayed CNNs with TC2011 = 251(Cao, 2001). As constant  < 0.7854, showing great is publication character, only three authors He, Ho, and Wang who  had contribution to their publications, such as conducting research and writing of the manuscript to research work (Herbertz& Müller-Hill, 1995; Reisenberg & Lundberg, 1990). Three authors Yu (j = 19.80), Tian (j = 12.73), and Liao (j = 11.31) had the(cid:2), just on the boundary of 0.7854 line owning the same quantity first authors articles and correspondingsame values of author articles. Yu with a greater value of j published much more first and corresponding author articles than that of Tianand Liao, since j is a constant related to publication quantity. Except these six authors, 21 authors had more correspondingauthor articles than first author articles ((cid:2) > 0.7854). Most top authors had more corresponding author articles than firstauthor articles, an indication that the leading authors were more likely to be the corresponding authors than the first author.Moreover, publication character  is an important parameter of Y-index for publication character, which is very helpfulespecially when j of authors is too close to distinguish the performance of authors. One group of authors with the same jwas exhibited in a dash line of an arc in Fig. 6, where each dot of the line had the same distance to the original point. Fiveauthors Wang (11.18, 0.1799), Ho (11.18, 0.1799), Sung (11.18, 1.107), Chen (11.18, 1.391), and Cheng (11.18, 1.391), had thesame value of j = 11.18, but (cid:2) are 0.1799, 1.107, and 1.391, respectively. An investigation presented that the correspondingauthor usually contributed more to the initial conception and supervision, while the first author contributed more to thework performed (Wren et al., 2007). It meant that Chen and Cheng were more likely to be credited for initial conception andsupervision, while Wang and Ho probably deserved more credits for the work performed. A potential bias would appearin the analysis of authorship of authors who use the same name and those who use different names in their publications.Another potential confounder arises when an author moves from one affiliation to another. It is strongly recommended thatan “international identity number” for all authors when they published their first paper in a Web  of Science-listed journal(Chiu & Ho, 2007).(cid:2)(cid:2)4. Discussion and conclusionsBy focusing on China’s independent top cited articles, this research has identified the discipline strength, researchhotspots, and key contributors of China without considering external roles of international collaboration. The dramaticincrease of China’s scientific outputs was observed, and China was ranked second, consistent with findings in previous  220H.-Z. Fu, Y.-S. Ho / Journal of Informetrics 7 (2013) 210– 222studies (Leydesdorff & Wagner, 2009; Mervis, 2010). China’s ability of publishing top cited articles has also been improv-ing from 1991 to 2003. Furthermore, pronounced activities in chemistry and physics were observed, which is also in linewith China’s overall research results, such as China’s all publications from 1997 to 2007 (Zhou & Glänzel, 2010) and China’shighly cited articles from 1999 to 2009 (Fu et al., 2011). China has made dramatic strides to overtake the USA in most ofthe technical areas, especially in physical and engineering sciences (Kostoff, 2008). China’s independent research was activein four core categories including multidisciplinary chemistry, physical chemistry, multidisciplinary materials science, andapplied physics. China’s research hotspots were observed to be nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanowires and nanostructures ofnanoscience and nanotechnology, neural networks, ZnO, and films. Six classic articles included three in medicine, two innanotube, and one in adsorption. Not only was China’s emerging presence in nanoscience found in its independent research,but also it was in the global research (Guan & Ma,  2007; Kostoff, 2012; Kostoff et al., 2007). China has become the secondlargest nation in citations behind the USA during 1995–2006 (Leydesdorff & Wagner, 2009), and its citation counts continueto grow (Kostoff, 2012). The international scientific collaboration played a major role in this Chinese research advance (Yeet al., 2012). This study provided an evidence that in despite of the international collaboration, China’s independent researchin nanoscience and nanotechnology contributed a lot to its scientific performance.Chinese Academy of Sciences dominated the production of top cited articles. The other most productive universities werelocated in Hong Kong and involved in the 985 Project with a large funding injection. The domination of Chinese Academyof Sciences, and the good performance of China’s universities with a large funding have also been found in other studies(Fu et al., 2011; Zhou & Leydesdorff, 2006). Most top authors were likely to be corresponding authors than first authors.This independent research for China was partly consistent with previous related studies, and provides more information(cid:2)) as a newly developed indicator whichof top cited articles, research emphases, classic articles, and Y-index. Y-index (j, was recently proposed by Ho (2012a,b),  has successfully attempted to evaluate both the publication quantity and charac-ter of contributing authors and institutions of China’s independent research. j indicates publication quantity, identifying“important authors”, while (cid:2) publication character differentiates its nature of leadership role (Ho, 2012b). Y-index providinganother choice could be adapted in other studies for the evaluation of authors, institutions and countries from a differentangle of authorship.ReferencesAksnes, D. W.  (2003).
