Research on ergonomics in industrial settingsmainly focuses on reducing the operator’s physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughputand avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resourcesdemand and mental workload could compromise the operator’s performance and the efficiency ofthe shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involvebulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for onlineassessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in humanmotion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton trackingare exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements.Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements.According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potentialto be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics inmanufacturing.1. IntroductionMental health problems at work affect hundreds ofmillions of people worldwide. About 17.6% of the globalworking population suffer from common mental disorders(CMD) [1], such as anxiety, bipolarity and acute stress. Theannual prevalence attains 38.2% in the European Union,embracing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),insomnia (7.0%), and major depression (6.9%) [2]. Manyrecent surveys [3] and systematic reviews [4, 5] indicate theinadequate organisation and management of the work as aprimary cause of such disorders and outline the relationshipbetween excessive working pressures and demands and theincidence of depression, poor health functioning, anxiety,distress, fatigue, job dissatisfaction and burnout.Besides, work-related stress and psychological riskshave direct financial implications for private companies andgovernments. In Europe, the cost related to mental illnesssymptoms is around 617 billion euros annually, includingemployers’ expenses (absenteeism, presenteeism, turnoverand loss in productivity) and social welfare costs [6].On the other hand, the introduction of hybrid manufac-turing systems, where workers and autonomous machinesoperate in close proximity, has contributed to changing therole of the human in the production chain, resulting in newoccupational safety and health (OSH) challenges. The digital-isation of the actual workplace has led to work intensification,constant time pressure and adaptation to rapid and frequentchanges in customer demand and requirements (i.e. goods toproduce and services to offer). Many of these changes provide∗Corresponding authormarta.lagomarsino@iit.it (M. Lagomarsino)ORCID(s): 0000-0001-9121-1812 (M. Lagomarsino)development opportunities, nevertheless, they may perilouslyincrease cognitive demand, when inadequately handled, andresult in adverse health and safety hazards. Consequently, theelevated mental workload may compromise the operator’sperformance and the efficiency of the workplace.The study of human cognitive factors will supplementthe well-established research on physical ergonomics [7, 8],to comprehensively understand how humans interact withthe environment and facilitate a reduction of the workload.In addition, various studies have shown that psychologicalfactors at work may have a significant influence on thedevelopment of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) [9]. Forinstance, mental workload, fatigue, and job stress can alterbiomechanical control strategies for upper extremities (i.e.neck, shoulders, arms, and hands) and low back extension,as well as increase gait and sway variability [10]. As a finalconsequence, the phenomenon may induce muscle pain inthe worker and even occupational injuries.The global burden of work-related mental disorders isexpected to increase year on year [11] and can no longer beoverlooked. Despite cognitive load theory has aroused muchinterest in the last decade [12], the study of cognitive load inmanufacturing operations is a moderately new topic [13, 14].The field of Cognitive Manufacturing [15] (i.e. the usage ofdata across systems, equipment and processes to optimise themanufacturing performance) has only very recently aimed toattain information about human workload.To the best of our knowledge, available tools can beused almost exclusively by experts or merely provide of-fline insights about the cognitive process (e.g. subjectivequestionnaires [16]). A first attempt toward a more usabletool was made by Thorvald et al. [17], who developed ananalytic method, denoted Cognitive Load Assessment forLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 1 of 14   An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksFigure 1: The system overview. Left: Conceptual illustration of workstation layout including: RGB-D camera, assembly, instructionsgraphical user interface (GUI), and storage area. Right: Block diagram of the proposed online framework to assess cognitive loadand provide visual feedback to the user.Manufacturing (CLAM), for assessing the cognitive burdenthat the worker is expected to employ within a particularassembly task and workstation layout. As a matter of fact,manual assembly is an essential activity in the manufacturingsector, which exposes workers to situations with varyingcognitive demands [18]. When combining the latter with hightime pressure, an increase in mental load frequently occurs[19]. The tool is intended to be used directly by workersinvolved in the manufacturing domain. Nevertheless, suchevaluation is still made offline, asking the end-users to fill aform and rate a set of factors associated with different aspectsof their daily activity.The scientific and industrial communities still need tobe provided with a validated set of models and metrics forthe cognitive workload. Particularly, gaps were identifiedin relation to the online assessment of the mental demandinflicted by manufacturing tasks.To respond to this challenge, the purpose of this paperis to develop a quantitative and online method to examinehow industrial work affects people relative to their attentiondistribution, decision-making, mental overload, frustration,stress and errors. We propose an online framework to monitorthe cognitive workload of human operators by detectingpatterns in their motion directly from the input imagesof a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeletontracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attentionand assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements (seesystem overview in Figure 1). The developed tool computesa list of indicators associated with different aspects of anassembly task and workstation layout in manufacturing. Eachfactor impacts with a weight on two defined indexes: themental effort and psychological stress level. According tothe scores interval, we determine the level of cognitive loadan individual is experiencing within the current setup. Thestudy employs assembly experiments to validate our onlineframework against state-of-the-art offline methods in the fieldof cognitive science (i.e. physiological signals, secondarytask-performance measure and subjective questionnaires).The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 wecharacterise cognitive load and provide an overview of relatedworks about the methods to measure it. Next, we present ourframework for the online assessment of mental effort andstress level. Pilot experiments are then proposed in section 5and the result are discussed and validated through statisticalanalysis. The final sections discuss the contributions andlimitations of the framework.2. Related worksThe evidence that undue cognitive demand at work canprejudice the mental health of workers and their manufactur-ing performance has increased the interest in cognitive loadtheory (CLT). CLT investigates the interaction of cognitivestructures, information and its implications [20]. In particular,the term cognitive load refers to the amount of processingthat performing a particular task imposes on the learner’scognitive system [12]. Xie and Salvendy [21] present adetailed conceptual framework of human information process-ing and distinguish between instantaneous and overall load.Instantaneous load is defined as the dynamics of cognitiveload, which constantly fluctuates over time as a response tostimuli that the present activity and environmental conditionsare imposing on the subject. Overall load results by thewhole working procedure and represents the experiencedand garnered instantaneous load in the human’s brain.A large and growing body of literature has investigatedtechniques to model human mental workload [22] andquantify the cost of performing tasks [21, 23]. Paas andVan Merriënboer [12] describe mental load, mental effort,performance, and level of stress as the measurable dimensionsof cognitive load. Generally, cognitive load measurementsbelong to three main categories: physiological measures,subjective rating scales and performance-based measures.Lagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 2 of 14Stress LevelMental EffortGUI inputsDepthRGB imagesProducts catalogueVisual FeedbackCognitive Load Assessment ToolAssembly Task and Workstation LayoutW1: AssemblyW3: Storage areaW2: Instructions GUIKINEMATICS TRACKINGATTENTION TRACKINGINTERACTION WITH INSTRUCTIONSCOGNITIVELOADASSESSMENTRGB-D cameraAn Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksPhysiological measurement of workload relies on evi-dence that increased mental demands lead to an increasedphysical response from the body [20]. Various researchershave investigated the relationship between mental effortand heart rate variability (HRV) metrics in three frequencybands of interest: very low frequency (VLF, 0–0.04 Hz),low frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF,0.15–0.4 Hz) [24, 25]. According to recent studies, intensecognitive demand leads to a decrease in HF power and agrowth in the LF, respectively related to a parasympatheticwithdrawal and a predominant increase in sympathetic ac-tivity [24, 26]. Besides, the galvanic skin response (GSR,also known as electrodermal activity, EDA) has been widelystudied to quantify cognitive states [27]. GSR or EDA is themeasure of the continuous changes in the skin’s electricalconductance caused by the variation of the sweating activityof the human body. The signal is typically described asa combination of two components, the tonic and phasicresponse. Researchers use high-resolution EDA for indexingvariations in sympathetic arousal associated with emotion,cognition, and attention [28, 29] and today represents oneof the preferred metrics for stress [30]. More recent studiesalso include measures of respiratory activity [31], eye activity[32, 33], cortisol level [34], speech measures [35], and brainactivity [36].Psychophysiological measurements provide objectiveand quantitative information, as well as the possibility tovisualise a continuous trend and identify detailed patterns ofload. However, these signals are highly sensitive to humanmovements, and the sensory acquisition system may bebothersome for the users and condition normal activities,severely limiting the adoption in real-world scenarios.Thus far, the measurement of cognitive load in laboratorysettings mainly relies on subjective rating scales [16]. Themost commonly used questionnaire is called NASA-TaskLoad Index (NASA-TLX) [37]. Self-ratings neverthelesshave many limitations [38]. Firstly, they are based on theassumption that people are able to introspect on the cognitiveprocesses and report the amount of experienced cognitiveeffort. Secondly, they are often affected by many biases, suchas acquiescence and social desirability. Lastly, the data aredelivered after the completion of the activity and can beexploited only following extensive analysis by experts in thearea of cognitive ergonomics and cognitive science.The third alternative to measuring cognitive load isthrough task- and performance-based techniques. Variousmetrics are presented in the literature (e.g. reaction time,accuracy and error rate) to assess the performance of boththe primary and secondary tasks [23]. The secondary task isperformed concurrently and is supposed to reflect the level ofthe cognitive load imposed by the primary task [12]. Despitethe high sensitivity and reliability, this technique can be rarelyapplied, even in laboratory settings.All the studies reviewed here support the hypothesis thatexisting approaches for cognitive load assessment have theirstrength and weakness and can be sensitive to distinctiveaspects of workload. When measuring workload empirically,the rule of thumb is to select a variety of measurements thatseem appropriate to the application and are likely to provideinsights into cognitive processes [39]. Unfortunately, mostof these techniques are potentially difficult to be applied inindustrial scenarios. Indeed, they require rather expensiveand impractical equipment that may be uncomfortable for theusers.Despite the increasing enthusiasm to understand themultidimensional construct of the mental workload, thecognitive manufacturing field is still looking for practicalsolutions [13]. Our work responds to the growing need togather online data giving insights about the mental processingsystem and enables the identification of excessive cognitiveload of assembly workers.3. The Cognitive Load AssessmentFrameworkThe overall structure of the proposed cognitive assess-ment framework is represented in Figure 2. Our method inves-tigates (i) the concentration level of a worker by consideringgaze direction and head pose, (ii) the stress level, by analysingactivity-related body language (i.e. self-touching occurrencesand high activity periods) and (iii) the information and partidentification cost, namely the cognitive effort required toutilise the assembly instructions and handle the right tools andcomponents to complete the task. Additionally, we include apriori defined parameters reflecting features of the specificassembly task and workstation layout (e.g. the number ofassembly parts and noise level). Combining all these factors,we compute the final scores of mental effort and stress level.This enables us to identify excessive cognitive load in theassembly workers. Besides, the framework includes a visualfeedback interface, through which intuitive warning messagescan be provided to the assemblers.To easily deploy the proposed framework in both lab-oratory and industrial settings, the choice of the externalsensory systems was driven by the implementation costsand users’ comfort (e.g. by avoiding wearability constraints).Hence, we selected a family of affordable active 3D imagingsystems, namely RGB-D cameras, to detect human operatorsand quantify their workload. The depth information and RGBimages of the camera are processed by the ‘human upper-body kinematics tracking’ module and the ‘attention tracking’module to compute a set of cognitive load factors introducedin Section 4. These two modules operate in synergy withthe ‘interaction with instructions’ module and converge intothe ‘cognitive load assessment’ module to compute the finalscores of mental effort and stress level (see Figure 2).Before describing the modules in detail, we provide thedefinition of the workstation layout. An operating environ-ment can be defined by the involved workstations and theirrelative configuration. We consider at least three types ofworkstations1 in industrial assembly tasks: the assemblyworkstation 𝑊1, which is the area occupied by the assembly1Throughout this paper, the term ‘operating environment’ (also knownas ‘working area’ or ‘workplace’) refers to a place available to manufacturingLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 3 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksFigure 2: Overall structure of the online cognitive load assessment framework. The proposed approach detects patterns in human’smotion (blue block), investigates workers’ attention (orange block) and their interaction with assembly instructions on a monitor(yellow block). Combining all these factors, final scores of mental effort and psychological stress level are computed (green block).components, the instructions workstation 𝑊2, where assem-bly information are displayed through e.g. a monitor, andthe storage area 𝑊3, where the assembly components (e.g.screws, nuts and tools) are stored. Based on the number ofworkstations, the system accordingly associates referenceframes (see Figure 1) in the position specified during aconfiguration phase. The locations of the reference frameswith respect to the operator’s head are used to determine thelevel of attention toward every workstation (see Section 3.2).3.1. Human Upper-Body Kinematics TrackingModuleThe central role of this module is to detect the presenceof a human operator entering the working area and to provideinformation to the system about the variations of his/herkinematic body configuration over time. We exploit a visualskeleton tracking algorithm, developed by StereoLabs2 totrack the human skeleton from the input images of a stereocamera. The module is, however, scalable to any other visualtracking method, e.g. OpenPose [40], or even IMU-basedmotion capture systems, such as Xsens suit3. The algorithmextracts the 3D position of twenty-five human keypoints (e.g.neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) in real-time. Among them, we select the ones belonging to the upperbody, and we analyse their displacements to compute factorsdefining the operator stress level (see Section 4.2).Spatio-temporal information of human movements is alsoused to distinguish between possible tasks performed by theoperator. To do this, the distance on the horizontal planebetween the "neck" skeleton keypoint and the workstationsis continuously computed: the worker is assumed to performthe task associated with the workstation he/she is closest to.For instance, we assume that the assembler is searching for atool if he/she accesses the storage area. On the other hand, thepersonnel to carry out work. The ‘workstation’ is instead a specific location,e.g. an assembly table, where employees perform specific tasks.2https://github.com/stereolabs3https://www.xsens.com/motion-capturemental effort factors (defined in Section 4.1) are computedonly if the subject is within a predefined range with respectto the assembly or instruction workstation (i.e. W1 or W2).3.2. Human Attention Tracking ModuleNowadays, several sensory systems can provide accuratemeasurements of human engagement and attention, suchas eye-tracking screen-based devices (e.g. Gazepoint GP3[32]) and glasses (e.g. Tobii Glasses 2 [33]), or electroen-cephalography headsets (e.g. Neurolectrics Enobio [36]).However, these systems bring about significant disadvan-tages such as discomfort (in wearable systems) and limitedoperational range (in screen-based eye-tracking devices).For these reasons, we developed a vision-based module,which is briefly outlined in Algorithm 1. We exploit a headtracker4, which adopts OpenCV to detect the human face anda TensorFlow pre-trained deep learning model to identifyfacial landmarks. To estimate the head pose, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem between the OpenFace5 3D modeland the detector’s output (i.e. sixty-eight keypoints in pixelcoordinates) is solved using the OpenCV function solvePnP.The PnP problem is stated as an iterative method based ona Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation [41] and the solutionis the pose that minimises the reprojection error, namely thesum of squared distances between the observed projectionson the image plane and the projected 3D points in the model.A Kalman Filter is used to stabilise the pose computed frameby frame.The output of the procedure is the location and orientationof the head with respect to the camera frame. According to theestimated odometry, a frame is associated with the head andthe transformation camera𝑇 expresses the head pose variationover time. Subsequently, we look up the transformationbetween the head frame and each workstation defined inthe configuration phase and the Cartesian vector expressinghead4https://github.com/yinguobing/head-pose-estimation5https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openfaceLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 4 of 14COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENTScores computationFactors computationATTENTION TRACKING KINEMATICS TRACKINGAttention recognitionBody language analysisInteraction with instructionsJoints'movementSelf-touchingeventFocusCheck backevent3D skeleton trackingHead pose estimationcamerahead  THuman workstation  GUI inputsDepthRGB imagesProducts catalogueAWi, i=1,..MMistake eventStress Level HyperactivityMental Effort?1......         ...

Inparticular, the azimuth and elevation values are separatelytransformed using a Raised-Cosine Filter [42], where asigmoid normalises the values to a scale from zero to one. Toobtain the desired behaviour in different ranges, we definethe function as follows:𝑓 (𝛼𝑖) =1,[11 − cos20,⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩( |𝛼𝑖|−𝛼min𝛼max−𝛼min𝜋)],≤ 𝛼min𝛼𝑖|if |||if 𝛼min < |𝛼𝑖|||> 𝛼max𝛼𝑖|if |||≤ 𝛼max(1)where 𝛼𝑖 is one of the two measured angles (i.e. azimuth𝜃𝑖(𝑡) or elevation 𝜑𝑖(𝑡)) at each time instant 𝑡, allowing thecontinuous localisation of the 𝑖-th workstation with respectto the subject’s gaze direction. The fuzzy function includescontrol points (𝛼𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑥 > 0) defined a priori, whichdetermine the independent upper and lower limits of thearea where the function has a smooth behaviour. Thus, theindicator 𝑓 (𝛼𝑖) decreases exponentially along with the growthof absolute angle value above the minimum threshold (𝛼𝑚𝑖𝑛),before levelling off at a maximum threshold (𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑥).The assessment of the attention level 𝐴W𝑖 toward each𝑖-th workstation is therefore computed as the product betweenthe normalised azimuth 𝜃𝑖(𝑡) and elevation 𝜑𝑖(𝑡) indicators:= 𝑓 (𝜃𝑖(𝑡))(𝜃𝑖(𝑡), 𝜑𝑖(𝑡)∗ 𝑓 (𝜑𝑖(𝑡)𝐴W𝑖(2)))Given the estimated attention to all workstations, we canassess if the worker is currently distracted or concentratedon a particular workstation. This is determined by simplychecking if at least one of the attention parameters is above apredefined threshold. If it would be the case, we find out theworkstation that the worker is looking at as the one in whichthe associated parameter 𝐴W𝑖 is maximum.3.3. Interaction with Instructions ModuleIn this work, we assume that assembly instructions areshown on a monitor through a Graphic User Interface (GUI),permitting the operator to browse them (see Figure 1). Inputsfrom the keyboard permit to watch the next instruction, checkthe same instruction again (i.e. instruction check back) orgo back in instructions. As a consequence, the ‘interactionwith instructions’ module is in charge of monitoring the taskadvancement. According to registered keyboard commands, itprovides the system with the number of steps of the assemblysequence that the user has already followed, the instructioncheck backs and the occurrence of an error in the assemblysequence that obliges the user to go back to more than oneinstruction.3.4. Cognitive Load Assessment ModuleThe last module exploits workload indicators in manu-facturing as identified by several experienced researchersand industrial experts [17]. Particularly, we define a list ofcognitive load factors and compute them starting from theoutput of the modules described above. Note that the unit ofanalysis is on the workplace level, including both the operatorand the workstations layout. Each factor is then multiplied byits assigned weight 𝜆 (see Section 5.D), and a definite sumof the weighted metrics determines the final scores of mentaleffort and stress level. A detailed description of the proposedcognitive load factors and scores can be found in the nextsection.4. Definition of cognitive load factors andfinal scoresWe define and develop a set of cognitive load factors thatare computed for each system pipeline loop and contributespecifically to one of the aforementioned indexes (i.e. mentaleffort and stress level). Some of the factors include both aninstantaneous and overall parameter, based on the cognitiveload definitions provided at the beginning of Section 2, andtheir specific usage will be explained afterwards. In addition,we present ‘workstation factors’, which may affect the totalcognitive load in assembly tasks. Note that the proposedindexes analyse the assembler behaviour within a predefinedworkstation layout. Moreover, each factor is not expected todirectly reflect human cognitive processing. Our position isthat a combination of those factors could provide insightsinto the human cognitive system.4.1. Mental effort factors4.1.1. Concentration Loss: This factor analyses the atten-tion that an individual gives to a task. It is based uponcontemporary psychology claim that cognitive load usurpsLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 5 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly Tasksexecutive resources, which otherwise could be used forattentional control, thus increases distraction [43].Accordingly, we assess here the amount of time notdedicated to the assembly, instructions or any other definedworkstation, and hence quantify how long an individual is notconcentrated on his/her assembly task. The ConcentrationLoss factor is thus defined asConcentration Loss(𝑡) = 1 −𝑀∑𝑤=1[attention time]𝑤time elapsed,(3)where 𝑀 is the number of workstations defined in theconfiguration phase. The ‘[attention time]𝑤’ is the intervalin which the subject is focused on the 𝑤-th workstation𝑊𝑤, namely 𝐴𝑊 𝑤 is above the predefined threshold and𝐴𝑊 𝑤 > 𝐴𝑊 𝑖, ∀ 𝑖 ≠ 𝑤. For instance, ‘[attention time]2’represents the time spent looking at the instructions on themonitor. Finally, the ‘time elapsed’ refers to the time passedsince the task starts, expressed in seconds6.4.1.2. Learning Delay: This metric investigates the abilityto rapidly learning a novel rule from instructions and assessesthe operator’s automaticity in completing the assembly.We took inspiration from Rapid Instructed Task Learning[44, 45] theory, which analyses the efficient action executionimmediately following instructions and without prior practice.The studies highlight that instructions can even produceautomatic effects in relatively simple tasks.The assumption here is that the more time the subjectspends focusing on the assembly components, the slower isthe learning. Hence, we can infer that the less trivial is thetask, the higher is the cognitive load. The Learning Delayfactor is thus defined asThe overall parameter keeps the memory of load that theoperator experiences during the task. Whenever the event 𝑑(i.e. loss of attention from any workstation) is detected, werecord the instant in which it occurs. Then, the ratio of thesum of the time instances and the time elapsed is considered:Concentration Demand(𝑡) =𝐷∑𝑑=1[instant of attention loss]𝑑time elapsed, (6)where 𝐷 is the number of total occurrences of attention losswhile working on the task. Note that each occurrence equallyimpacts the indicator, and as time passes, the contribution ofa past event decreases.4.1.4. Instructions Cost: This metric examines the generalquality of the instructions used to gather information aboutthe work. The analysis relies on human-computer interactionguidelines and studies on the required cognitive effort toutilise them [47]. We counted the attention switches betweenthe assembly workstation and the monitor, excluding therequired checks for a new instruction. The instantaneousparameter defines the cost of information per instruction asInstructions Cost(𝑖𝑛) = instruction checks − 1,(7)where 𝑖𝑛 is the 𝑛-th instruction. On the other hand, the overallparameter considers the 𝐶 instants in which the event 𝑐 (i.e.a not required switch) occurred:not required switches = instruction checks− instructions showed,Learning Delay(𝑡) =assembly timetime elapsed,Instructions Cost(𝑡) =(4)𝐶∑𝑐=1[instant of not required switch]𝑐time elapsed(8)where ‘assembly time’ or ‘[attention time]1’ is the interval inwhich the subject focuses on the assembly workstation 𝑊1.4.1.3. Concentration Demand: The estimated incidenceof attention failures is usually associated with cognitionoverload [46]. This factor is defined as the number of timesthe subject gets distracted, losing their attention toward allworkstations involved in the task.In particular, the instantaneous parameter evaluates thetransitions to not attention per instruction, excluding the onesto shift the focus to another workstation, thus is defined asConcentration Demand(𝑖𝑛) =𝑀∑([losses of attention]𝑤𝑤=1),− [switches to another workstation]𝑤(5)where 𝑖𝑛 represents the 𝑛-th instruction and 𝑀 is the numberof defined workstations.6Note that ‘time elapsed’ is defined in the same way for all the factors.4.1.5. Task Difficulty: This factor estimates the requiredcognitive effort to perform a task. To do that, the frameworkautomatically records the instructional check backs 𝑏 onthe GUI. Since task demand can vary as a function of thecognitive load [48], the instantaneous parameter is also herecomplemented with an overall parameter. The latters are thusdefined asTask Difficulty(𝑖𝑁 ) = instruction check backs,Task Difficulty(𝑡) =𝐵∑𝑏=1[instant of instruction check back]𝑏time elapsed(9)where 𝐵 is the total amount of instruction check backsperformed during the task.4.1.6. Frustration by Failure: This is a simple metricdescribing the mechanism triggered after making a mistake𝑒. The instantaneous and overall parameters are computedas for previous factors:Frustration by Failure(𝑖𝑛) = number of mistakes made,Lagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 6 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksFrustration by Failure(𝑡) =𝐸∑𝑒=1[instant of mistake occurrence]𝑒time elapsed(10)with 𝐸 the total amount of mistakes made during the task.Here, an error in the assembly sequence is detected wheneverthe user goes back to more than one instruction.It should be reminded that, thanks to skeleton tracking,we detect in which workstation the operator is. Hence, pleasenote that the factors described above are computed only if thehuman is in proximity to workstation W1 and remain constantif the operator moves away.4.1.7. Tool Identification: This factor assesses the mentalprocessing to identify the tool needed for the assembly.Whenever the storage area is accessed (i.e. the human is inproximity to workstation W3), the Tool Identification factoris computed as the time spent to seek the right tool in tenthsof a second.4.2. Stress level factorsThe analysis of body language is gaining an increasinginterest in the emerging field of automatic detection of stress[49]. Accordingly, we defined activity-related features solelybased on visual information and the derived skeleton tracking.4.2.1. Self-touching: It has been proven that self-touchingis a behavioural indicator of stress and anxiety [50]. Wecompute the distance between each hand and the head keypoints of the detected skeleton. If the value is below apredefined threshold, a self-touching occurrence is registeredand impacts the final score for a minute:Self-touching(𝑡) =𝑆∑𝑠=1[instant of self-touching]𝑠 + 60 − 𝑡60(11)where 𝑆 is the number of self-touching occurrences 𝜖 [𝑡 −60, 𝑡] and 𝑡 is the time in seconds.4.2.2. Hyperactivity: An analysis of human motion isperformed to detect stress-related high activity periods. Ourmethod is solely based on visual spatiotemporal informa-tion of human kinematics extracted from video sequencesrepresenting the monitored subject.During an initial calibration phase, we capture the upperbody joints movement within two subsequent frames andstore the mean 𝜇1, 𝜇2...𝜇𝑁 and standard deviation 𝜎1, 𝜎2...𝜎𝑁(where 𝑁 is the number of selected upper body joints) of thesum of the displacements in a time window 𝜏. This baselinerecording permits us to compare the online data with a sessionunder resting conditions. Then, during task execution, weperiodically compute the deviation of every joint from itsmean motion. If a 𝑗-th joint’s deviation Δ𝑗 is greater thanthe stored standard deviation 𝜎𝑗, a parameter associated with𝑗-th joint, called ‘activity’, is evaluated as the ratio betweenΔ𝑗 and 𝜎𝑗. A unique descriptor of activity level is computedas the mean of all the upper body joints’ activity.4.3. Workstation factorsThe worker can navigate the list of products and combinedifferent objects in sequences to handle more complex assem-blies. In the catalogue (.csv file), the number of componentsand required tools for each object are specified. The sequenceof objects to assemble is loaded and the following parametersare evaluated for the selected task.4.3.1. Number of assembly components: A parameter,normalised between 0 and 1, rising linearly with the numberof parts intended to be assembled into a complex product.4.3.2. Number of tools used: A normalised parameterdescribing the number of tool used to complete the assembly.4.3.3. Physical effort: The required physical effort to per-form a task. The estimated difficulty factor takes valuesbetween 0 (simple - not previous experience is required) and1 (difficult - significant training and experience are required).4.3.4. Variant flora: An estimation of the level of variationon a workstation (from no variation, i.e. one-piece production,to full variation, i.e. flexible and customised production).In addition, several environmental factors such as lightingconditions, temperature and level of noise may influence theoperators’ conditions. While the first two can be consideredrather constant in an industrial workplace, the level of noisemay greatly vary depending on the working scenario. Thereis increasing evidence that chronic noise stress impairscognition and induces oxidative stress in the brain [51]. Withthis in mind, the Level of noise factor has been defined.4.3.5. Level of noise: The sound pressure level in manu-facturing environment. A sound sensor could measure thesurrounding ambient sound in the audible frequency spectrumfor the human ear. Given the mean level of noise 𝜇𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 in A-weighted decibels (dBA), the parameter is defined as follows:Level of noise =0,parabolic function,1,⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩≤ 20 dBAif 𝜇noiseif 20 < 𝜇noiseif 𝜇noise > 70 dBA≤ 70 dBA(12)where the thresholds (20 and 70 dBA) are defined in compli-ance with recommended standard occupation noise exposure[51].4.4. Cognitive load scores estimationThe cognitive load factors described in the previoussections are computed online, in the background of workersnormal activities. This is to identify excessive cognitive loadon the fly and deliver warning messages to the assemblyworker. With this aim, we multiply each factor by a weight(see Section 5.D): the sum of the weighted mental effort andstress level factors results respectively in the two homonyms‘higher-level’ scores.Lagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 7 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly Tasksperformed online), however, it was acquired as a backup tomeasure the detection accuracy of subjects’ motion patterns.The experiments aimed to cross-test the performance ofour cognitive load assessment framework against physiologi-cal measurements. In particular, the trend of the mental effortwas analysed in relation to heart rate variability, while thestress level was compared with the commonly used featuresin galvanic skin response. The following section justifiesthe choice of these specific parameters as ground truth anddescribes the sensors adopted (also highlighted in Figure 4)and the post-processing of the acquired signals.5.2. Baseline measurements5.2.1. HRV responses: A chest strap (H108, Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland) was used to record the electrocardio-gram (ECG) signal. The RR interval, i.e. the time elapsedbetween two successive R-waves, were extracted from theraw ECG. Cardiovascular data analysis was subsequentlyperformed using Kubios software9. The tool computes severalclassical metrics in time, frequency and non-linear domain. Inthis work, the frequency domain HRV data were considered.More precisely, the LF/HF ratio is selected since it isindicative of the mental effort, as suggested by the literature[26, 25].5.2.2. Galvanic skin responses: The skin conductance wasmonitored by wristband Empatica E410, a medical-gradewearable device acquiring real-time physiological data. Therecorded GSR signal was then processed using the open-source MATLAB toolbox Ledalab11. A Butterworth lowpass filter with a cut-off frequency at 2 Hz was used tofilter the high-frequency components. Finally, we applied thecontinuous decomposition analysis to separate the tonic (SkinConductance Level, SCL) and phasic (Skin ConductanceResponse, SCR) components. As Marucci et al. [28], weinvestigated the mean value of the SCL and the meanamplitude of the SCR peaks to assess the stress induced bythe whole task on participants.8https://tinyurl.com/polarH109https://www.kubios.com10https://www.empatica.com/en-eu/research/e411http://www.ledalab.deFigure 4: Measurements and sensors used as ground truth totest our metrics.Figure 3: Overview of the experimental setup highlighting:zed2 stereo camera, instructions GUI (monitor and keyboard),storage area and screen providing visual feedback. The 3Dassembly is placed on the table in front of the subject.The mental effort is computed at two different levels. Itsdynamics is estimated online exploiting the instantaneousparameters and provided as feedback through a dedicatedscreen. A detailed description of the visual feedback interfaceis presented in Section 6.5. For the post hoc analysis, weinstead select the overall factors since, at this stage, we donot aim to evaluate the cognitive load triggered by a stimulusbut the overall mental effort induced by the whole task andcross-compare its trend among diverse testing conditions.On the other hand, the stress level score is defined by thehyperactivity, plus each occurrence of self-touching impactswith a predefined value on the final score, and, as time passes,its contribution decreases.5. Experimental analysisIn this section, the experimental campaign to validate ourframework is described in detail. We adopted both quantita-tive and qualitative measures to assess the performance andpotentials of the proposed approach.5.1. Experimental setupFor the experiments, we reproduced a possible operatingenvironment in our laboratory (see Figure 3). The participantswere asked to sit at a desk, and a 3D printed assemblykit7 was placed on the table (defining workstation W1). Theinstructions to assemble the object were shown on a monitor(workstation W2) and consisted of short videos of about 20s each. The user could browse them through a GUI. Inputsfrom the keyboard permitted to watch the next instruction,reproduce the same instruction video (i.e. instruction checkback) or go back in instructions. Finally, small boxes withscrews, bolts, nuts and required tools were placed in the arearight behind the participant defining workstation W3.A stereo camera (zed2, Stereolabs, San Francisco, CA,USA) monitored the participant from the front for the entireduration of the experiment. Note that the framework does notrequire the recording of a video (i.e. the computations were7https://tinyurl.com/3DprintedassemblyLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 8 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly Tasks5.2.3. Secondary task performance: Concurrently withthe primary assembly task, participants were asked somequestions (three per experimental condition) through head-phones. In the task-based methodology, performance on asecondary task is supposed to reflect the level of the cognitiveload imposed by the primary task [12]. We measured thereaction time of the user to the presented query whose answeris well known (e.g. the spelling of the name, the date of born,etc.).5.2.4. Subjective questionnaire: At the end of the exper-iment, we asked participants to fill NASA-TLX [37] anda custom questionnaire. The latter is a subjective scalingapproach to capture mental effort- and stress-related factors indifferent task conditions. The evaluation includes a techniquedeveloped by NASA to assess the relative importance offactors in determining the experienced workload. Pairs ofrating scale labels are presented, and the subject is asked toselect which of the two was more relevant to the experienceof cognitive workload in the task just performed. From thepattern of choices, we are able to associate a weight to eachcognitive load factor and compute the overall score consistentwith the experience of a specific subject. A copy of the customquestionnaire can be found as supplementary materials forthis paper.5.3. Experimental protocolThe whole experimental procedure was carried out atHuman-Robot Interfaces and Physical Interaction (HRII)Lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in accordance withthe Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approvedby the ethics committee Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)Genovese N.3 (Protocol IIT_HRII_ERGOLEAN 156/2020).All the subjects recruited were volunteers, naïve about thepurpose of the experiment, and declared not to suffer fromany mental disorder or cardiovascular disease. The cognitiveload employed by a worker is highly susceptible to the skillsof the individual assessor. Thus, personnel without previousexpertise and experience in the presented assembly task wasconsidered.The study employed a within-subjects experiment inwhich each participant underwent all three experimentalconditions. The tasks were devised with three levels ofcomplexity (i.e. task 1 - simple, task 2 - medium, and task3 - difficult) and industrial noise (i.e. task 1 - low, 45 dBA,task 2 - medium, 65 dBA, and task 3 - high, 75 dBA). Thetasks order was defined as 1-2-3 for all the subjects, withthe aim of imposing a growing complexity and thus identifyan increase in cognitive effort. The participants had fifteenminutes to complete each section. Before the beginningof the experiment, an initial calibration was performed tocapture the physiological parameters and track the upperjoints movements under resting conditions and then, setthem as a reference. Moreover, the user had the chance toget familiar with the assembly parts and the interface forinstructions.The rest of the section describes two different experi-mental sessions that represent the consecutive phases in thedevelopment of our framework.5.4. Model calibration experimentsThe purpose of the first experimental session was to testthe setup and identify the weights that should be associatedwith each cognitive load factor for the computation ofcognitive load scores. To do this, five male subjects (27.6±2.0years old) performed the whole experiment and filled in thecustom questionnaire. Analysing factors’ trend over time, wedefined thresholds that thereafter permit the normalisationof the values assumed by cognitive load factors (i.e. ∈[0, 1]). Given the patterns of choices in the questionnaire,we computed the weights that each subject would associatewith each factor. The mean among all subjects for each factorweight was used in the second experimental session to createweighted combinations resulting in the mental effort andstress level scores.5.5. Multi-subject cognitive load assessmentexperimentsTen subjects, five males and five females (26.6±3.7 yearsold), were recruited for the second session. During the test,the cognitive load factors were computed online, and thefinal scores were shown on a monitor, only visible to theresearcher (see Figure 3). At the same time, physiologicalmeasurements were recorded. A statistical analysis wassubsequently performed on the acquired data. We adopted thenon-parametric repeated measures Friedman’s test to examineif the subject experienced different conditions imposed by theexperiment (low, medium and high cognitive load). Finally,Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was used to assess ifany relationship exists between the scores computed in theproposed framework and our ground truth measurements (i.e.physiological signals, performance measure and question-naires).6. Experimental resultsIn this section, the results of the two experimentalsessions are presented. We begin by outlining the outcomesof the model calibration experiments, highlighting the func-tioning of the final framework. This is followed by a deepanalysis of cognitive load-related data acquired in multi-subject experiments. Finally, we report the outcome of theonline visual feedback interface.6.1. Model calibrationTable 1 shows the results of the model calibrationexperiments. Concentration Loss and Learning Delay take onvalues between 0.0 and 1.0 by definition. Tool Identificationfactor saturates to 1.0 after ten seconds as a practical choice.On the contrary, the other factors have to be normalised. Tothis aim, we defined upper-limit thresholds for each proposedfactor as the maximum registered value for all subjects whotook part in the first testing session.Lagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 9 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksFigure 5: Concentration Loss, Learning Delay, Instructions Cost and Task Difficulty factors associated to subject 1 during threeexperimental conditions.Table 1Thresholds and Weights associated with mental effort factorsThresholdsWeightsInstantaneous OverallConcentration LossLearning DelayConcentration DemandInstruction CostTask DifficultyFrustration by FailureTool Identification--121362---26.026.110.74.7-1.63.21.64.02.23.01.4Besides, patterns of labels’ choices in the custom ques-tionnaire show the relative importance of the proposedfactors in determining how much mental effort the operatoris experiencing in the task. The third column of table 1illustrates the means of the weights given by participants toeach factor. Interestingly, the cognitive demand to understandinstructions (e.g. Instruction Cost) represents the perceivedmost crucial contributor to workload.6.2. Cognitive load factor assessment6.2.1. Mental effort: Figure 5 displays the mental effortfactors over time for one subject, as an example. We reportConcentration Loss, Learning Delay, Instruction Cost andTask Difficulty factors since they show a meaningful trendthroughout the task execution. On the other hand, the impactof Concentration Demand, Frustration by Failure and ToolIdentification factors is punctual when a specific event occurs.The results of tasks 1, 2 and 3 are reported on the same chartto highlight differences in the trends. Note that the participantcompleted the first and second task before the total availabletime (i.e. fifteen minutes). The factors are normalised online,when needed, according to thresholds defined in the firstexperimental session.The results obtained from the weighted combination ofthe factors are presented in Figure 7 (first row). In particular,the black line sets out the trend of the mental effort score overtime in the different experimental conditions. Coloured barshighlight instead the score mean in three-minute intervals.6.2.2. Stress level: The estimated stress of a participantduring the experiments is illustrated in Figure 8 (first row).Specifically, each occurrence of self-touching impacts 0.2 onthe final score and as time passes, the contribution decreases(reaching zero after one minute). The grey and black profilesrepresent hyperactivity and self-touching factors, respectively.By summing them, the stress level score is evaluated andits mean within blocks lasting three minutes is reported ascoloured bars.6.3. Significance of experimental conditions6.3.1. Cognitive load scores: The mental effort and stresslevel means in three-minute intervals were compared with aFriedman’s test to access differences in tasks across repeatedmeasures. The imposed conditions (i.e. increasing complex-ity and noise) affect the mental effort score significantly,𝜒 2=6.58, p=0.0373, and the stress level score marginally,𝜒 2=5.96, p=0.0507.6.3.2. HRV responses: Cardiovascular data analysis wasperformed on three-minute blocks of RR intervals of ECG sig-nal. For all the subjects, we extract HRV features in frequency-domain and differences in their trend were assessed usingFriedman’s test with repeated measures (three-minute blocks).Different experimental conditions significantly impact theLF (Hz) parameter (𝜒 2=6.68 p=0.0354), which exhibits apredominant decrease over the tasks. HF (Hz) showed insteadmarginal difference among the tasks (𝜒 2=5.88 p=0.0529).Median LF/HF ratio levels for the low, medium and highimposed cognitive load experiments were 3.10, 3.64 and 3.77,respectively. The statistical test revealed a significant differ-ence in LF/HF ratio depending on the imposed complexityand noise, 𝜒 2=9.24 p=0.0098.6.3.3. Galvanic skin responses: As Marucci et al. [28], weinvestigated the mean value of the SCL and the mean ampli-tude of the SCR peaks during the experimental conditions.The analysis was performed in three-minute intervals withFriedman’s test. Both tonic and phasic components revealeda significant main effect of the load condition (p<0.01).6.3.4. Secondary task performance: Friedman’s test re-vealed a statistically significant difference in the reactionLagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 10 of 14NormalisedfactorAn Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly TasksFigure 6: Results of the subjective evaluations (NASA TLX and custom questionnaire): bars represent mean and standard errorbetween scores given by participants in different experimental conditions.time of the secondary task (𝜒 2=10.23 p<0.01). In general, theparticipants tended to delay the answer as the task complexityincreases.6.3.5. Subjective questionnaires: Figure 6 presents theresults of subjective questionnaires in the three experimentalconditions. The bars represent the mean of the scores assignedby participants and the error bars display the 95% confidenceof scale means. The Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted tocompare the three conditions in a systematic manner. Theresults from the NASA-TLX show statistically significantdifferences in mental demand (𝜒 2=10.61 p=0.005) andeffort (𝜒 2=14.22 p=0.0008) among the tasks. For the otherscores, the p-values were over 0.05 significance level. Fromthe custom questionnaire, we identify a significant effectin perceived concentration demand (𝜒 2=7.11 p=0.0286),learning delay (i.e. automaticity in completing the assem-bly, 𝜒 2=6.48.11 p=0.0392) and task difficulty (𝜒 2=14.33p=0.0008) depending on imposed experimental conditions.Finally, the latter significantly affect the overall cognitiveworkload score (𝜒 2=7.24 p=0.0267) computed by the ratingscombination defined in the first testing session.6.4. Correlation between cognitive load scores andphysiological variablesA Spearman’s rank-order correlation was run to determineif a relationship exists between the scores computed in ourframework and standard measures presented in the literaturefor the assessment of cognitive load. Figure 7 comparesthe trend of the mental effort score with the ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (LF/HF ratio) inthree-minute intervals extracted from ECG signals (secondrow). For seven out of ten participants, there was a strong,positive correlation between the mean within three-minuteblocks of the computed score and the HRV feature, whichwas statistically significant (see Table 2 first row). For eachsubject, we also compute the correlation between the mentaleffort score and the reaction time in the secondary task (threequestions per experimental condition every three minutes).The test revealed a positive correlation, but no significancewas found (see Table 2 second row).The trend of the stress level score is instead analysed incomparison with GSR-related measures.

The bottom half of table 2 provides thesummary statistics. The skin conductance variables werepartially correlated with the estimated score. In particular,positive correlations were detected, but they were statisticallysignificant just for few subjects.cognitive load is identified (green - low cognitive load,yellow - medium cognitive load, orange - high cognitiveload, and red - very high cognitive load). The reader canbetter understand the functioning of the implemented visualfeedback by watching the video provided as supplementarymaterial for this paper.6.5. Online visual feedbackCognitive load scores are computed online since our finalgoal is to identify the excessive cognitive load and deliverwarning messages to the human operator. An interface wasdesigned and implemented to provide visual feedback on theworkload that the worker is currently experiencing duringthe assembly task (see Figure 9). The interface shows thereal-time acquired video depicting the monitored subject.A pyramidal shape is drawn on the image to highlight thefacing direction, and the percentage of attention towardthe assembly (𝑊1) and instructions (𝑊2) workstations isspecified. Within this context, the workstation factors andinstantaneous parameters are considered, and their weightedcombinations result in the instantaneous scores of mentaleffort and stress level. The latter is represented as colour-coded bars. Colour is used here to warn when excessiveFigure 9: Online visual feedback reporting: current headdirection, percentage of attention toward involved workstations,and estimated mental effort and stress level scores as colour-coded bars.7. DiscussionFrom the performance comparison between our vision-based framework and state-of-the-art methods, we observed,in the trends, differences among the various experimentalconditions (i.e. increasing task complexity and noise). There-fore, statistical analysis was performed on the acquired data.Statistical significance through separate repeated-measuresanalysis of variance was found for both HRV and GSRfeatures, as for the outcomes of the secondary task andquestionnaires, in the different testing sessions. Hence, wecan infer that the subject actually experienced the imposedcognitive load conditions.A promising finding was that statistically significantdifferences were also identified in the cognitive load scorescomputed by our method (i.e. mental effort and stress level).This encouraged us to compare our online scores with state-of-the-art offline methods hardly deployable in industrialsettings. As observed in Table 2, the mental effort mean inthree-minute intervals appeared to be positively correlated tothe LF/HF ratio extracted from ECG signal within the sametime intervals and to secondary task performance. Moreover,positive correlations were detected between the stress leveland GSR-related features.Results provided first evidence on the capability of themethod to provide meaningful and reliable insights aboutthe human cognitive load at work. Practical strong points ofthe setup include the reduced cost of the system componentsand the users’ comfort while performing their tasks. Ourcognitive load assessment framework does not require theworker to wear any sensor and can be easily configured andused by non-experts in the areas of cognitive ergonomics andhuman-computer interaction.Besides, it is worth mentioning that the system is capableof identifying online excessive workload periods in assemblytasks and providing visual feedback using colour-coded bars.Lagomarsino et al.: Preprint submitted to ElsevierPage 12 of 14An Online Framework for Cognitive Load Assessment in Assembly Tasks8. ConclusionsThis paper presented an online and quantitative method tomonitor the cognitive load of human operators by analysingthe attention distribution and detecting motion patterns inassembly activities directly from the input images of a stereocamera. The main focus was on identifying risks in tasksand workstation design, where excessive workload mightlead to errors or work difficulty. We exploited cognitive loadfactors in manufacturing as identified by experts [17] andevaluated them online through cutting-edge artificial intel-ligence algorithms (i.e. head pose estimation and skeletontracking). We estimated the mental effort and stress levelcurrently experienced by the worker, investigating attention-and activity-related behavioural features, and we deliveredintuitive warning messages on a screen.The proposed method shows promising features to beapplied to the manufacturing sector. The framework indeedworks online, does not require expensive equipment and doesnot ask the human worker to wear any sensor permitting thenatural flow of work activities. The main limitation is theassumption of a well-structured working environment, whereassembly instructions are shown on a monitor. A naturalprogression of this research is to generalise the framework,including more workstations and examining complicatedindustrial operations with multiple human workers.Future works could also investigate the benefits of asubject-specific model of cognitive load processes to addressindividual demands and characteristics of the workers. Be-sides, both the weights and the thresholds defined for thedeveloped factors could be tuned depending on each userfeedback or previous user-specific calibration phase.The final results suggest that the presented method hasthe potential to be integrated into the development of human-robot interaction systems for improving human cognitiveergonomics in industrial settings.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported in part by the ERC-StG Ergo-Lean (Grant Agreement No.850932), in part by the EuropeanUnion’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmeunder Grant Agreement No. 871237 (SOPHIA).References[1] Z.
