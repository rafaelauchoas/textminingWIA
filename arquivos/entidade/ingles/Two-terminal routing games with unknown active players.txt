IntroductionThe study of congestion games [20,17,14] is central to game theory, transportation engineering, multi-agent systems,CS/AI, electronic commerce, and communication networks. In the last decade congestion games have been a central ingre-dient in the border of the above disciplines.1 Most of the related studies assume complete information about the set (andin particular the number) of participants in the system.2 However, in many settings, although the set of registered/potentialparticipants may be known, the actual set of active participants is unknown. Hence, incorporating uncertainty about the setof actual participants into congestion settings is a desirable task.A routing game is defined by a congestion network and a set of players. A congestion network consists of a directedgraph, a vector of edge cost functions, and a set of source-target pairs. Each player is associated with a source-target pair.Every player has to move one unit of good from her source to her target. In a splittable routing game, the player can splither unit amongst the paths that connect the source to the target, and in an unsplittable routing game the players cannotsplit their units. The edge cost functions determine the cost of every user of the edge as a function of the number of users.Routing games are a special type of congestion games.3 In this paper we focus on routing games that are determined by✩This paper is based on an extended abstract, titled “Symmetric routing games with an unknown set of active players”, presented at AAMAS-07, anda paper titled “Resource Selection Games with Unknown Number of Players”, presented at AAMAS-06.

Every congestion form, and a finite set of users uniquely define a congestion game. However, distinct congestion formscan generate identical congestion games. A particular type of form is the one generated by a congestion network.0004-3702/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.artint.2009.07.0021442I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–1455two-terminal congestion networks. That is, there is a single source-target pair, which is associated with all users. From[13] it can derived that every symmetric congestion game is a 2-terminal routing game.4 In this paper, when dealing withsplittable routing games we assume that the edge cost functions are increasing, continuously differentiable, and convex.When dealing with unsplittable routing games we assume only that they are non-decreasing. In a routing game withcomplete information every player knows the network structure, the cost functions, and the number of users. In a routinggame with incomplete information discussed in this paper, every active player knows all of the above except for the numberof active players; she does know the number of potential players.5 In this paper we assume that there is no commonlyknown prior probability distribution over the possible number of active players. Hence we suggest to model behavior of theplayers in these games by the concept of safety-level equilibrium, which was recently defined for games with incompleteinformation in [1]. A safety-level equilibrium is a strategy profile in which each agent minimizes her worst case cost overall possible states of the environment, assuming the other agents stick to their prescribed strategies. In the context ofrouting games discussed in this paper, the possible states of the environment correspond to the possible sets of activeplayers. A useful observation is that the worst case cost for a player occurs when all players are active. This follows sincethe edge cost functions are non-decreasing. Let c(k) be the cost of each player in equilibrium in the complete informationcase when there are k players, and c(k, n) be the cost of each player in a safety-level equilibrium in the related game withincomplete information when there are k active players and n potential players. We define the value of ignorance to beν(k, n) = c(k) − c(k, n). If this value is non-negative, ignorance is beneficial (in the weak sense) for the players.6 In orderfor the above index of the value of ignorance to make sense the cost in equilibrium at each of the above settings shouldbe uniquely defined. Therefore, parts of this paper are devoted to proving existence and uniqueness of equilibrium results.While analysis of the value of ignorance is performed only for congestion networks with linear cost functions, our existenceand uniqueness theorem are proved for more general cost functions.Our results concerning the value of ignorance in models with linear cost functions are as follows: Fix the number, k (cid:2) 1,of active players. We show the following structure of the function ν(k, n) for k (cid:3) n < ∞:In symmetric splittable routing games: ν(k, n) is non-negative and non-decreasing in n at the interval [k, 2k − 1], and it isnon-increasing in n at the interval [2k − 1, ∞). More refined structure is proved for the subclass ofsplittable parallel routing games: if k is sufficiently large, it is proved that ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0 for k < n (cid:3) k(k + 1) − 1, and itvanishes at n = k(k + 1) − 1. Consequently, for n > k(k + 1) − 1, the value of ignorance is not positive. That is, knowledge isa desirable good. Finally, we prove forunsplittable parallel routing games: For sufficiently large k, ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0 for every n > k, and it is maximized over n ∈ [k, ∞)at n = 2k − 1.Our results have interesting implications in the context of protocol design in congestion settings with incomplete infor-mation. Consider an organizer who knows the number of participants at each given point, and wishes to maximize socialsurplus. That is, the organizer’s goal is to minimize the agents’ costs. In ranges in which the value of ignorance is positive(e.g., when the number of potential participants is not too large with respect to the number of active participants) the orga-nizer should not reveal the number of actual participants. Analogously, in ranges in which the value of ignorance is negativethe organizer should reveal the number of actual participants. Note that if the costs are paid to a revenue-maximizingorganizer, the above policies should be reversed.The paper is organized as follows: Sections 2–4 are devoted to the analysis of 2-terminal splittable routing games withcomplete information. In Sections 5–6 we analyze the value of ignorance in 2-terminal splittable routing games. In Section 7we analyze parallel unsplittable routing games (which we call resource selection games) with complete information, and inSection 8 we discuss the value of ignorance for such games.2. Congestion networksA congestion network consists of a directed graph, a set of source-target pairs, and a vector of edge cost functions. Inthis paper we deal only with 2-terminal congestion networks, i.e. congestion networks which posses a single source-targetpair.2.1. 2-terminal congestion networksLet G = (V , E, v s, vt) be a 2-terminal directed graph without self-loops, where V is a finite set of nodes, E is a finite setof edges, and v s, vt ∈ V are two distinct nodes called the source node and the target node, respectively. For every v ∈ Vwe denote by Out(v) and In(v) the set of out-going and in-coming edges of v, respectively. A route is a directed path withdistinct nodes that connects v s to vt . For every edge e ∈ E and a route R we write e ∈ R whenever e is part of the route R.Let RO be the set of routes. We assume that RO (cid:5)= ∅.4 It is not known whether every congestion game is a routing game.5 In our model there is a finite number of agents. The initial research of congestion games [20], as well as much of the recent research [19,18] discusscongestion games with continuum of agents, which are called non-atomic congestion games.6 We chose to refer to the “value of ignorance” rather than to the “value of knowledge” because it turns out that ignorance is often beneficial to theplayers.I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–14551443Every edge e ∈ E is associated with a cost function de : (cid:7) → (cid:7) which, unless we say otherwise, satisfies the followingproperties:– de is continuously differentiable, convex, increasing, and de(x) > 0 for every x > 0.7de(x) is interpreted as the cost per unit that is moved through e when the load on e is x.8 A congestion network iscalled linear if for every edge e there exist constants ae, be such that de(x) = ae x + be for every e ∈ E and for every x ∈ (cid:7).Obviously, in a linear cost function satisfying the above conditions ae > 0 and be (cid:2) 0 for every e ∈ E. Much of the literatureon congestion networks deals with linear congestion networks. In addition to its mathematical convenience, this type ofassumption is quite natural in settings in which the cost function captures the delay on an edge; the assumption that thedelay on edge is a linear function of the load is quite intuitive.Let d = (de)e∈E be the vector of edge cost functions. The tuple N = (G, d) is called a 2-terminal congestion network.A 2-terminal congestion network is called parallel if V = {v s, vt }. The study of parallel congestion networks is most popularin the literature. One reason for that is the fact they capture the classical situation of alternative resources that can bechosen from by a set of parties, each of which having its own job/task. This is the canonical situation studied in OperationsResearch and related communities.2.2. Route flows and edge flowsConsider an agent who has to move a continuously divisible unit of good from the source to the target. A splitting policy(cid:2)for such an agent is therefore a function g : RO → [0, 1] withR∈RO g(R) = 1. That is, for every route R, g(R) is interpretedas the proportion of the unit sent through the route R. Such a splitting policy is also called a route flow. For every routeflow g and for every e ∈ E let f ef eg is the number of units routed through e. It is well knowngthat for every route flow g the following two conditions hold for the vector f = ( f e)e∈E = ( f eR∈RO|e∈R g(R). That is,(cid:2)=g )e∈E :(cid:3)e∈Out(v)f e (cid:2) 0,f e =(cid:3)e∈In(v)f e + r vfor every v ∈ V ,for every e ∈ E,where(cid:4)r v =1,−1,0v = v s,v = vt ,otherwise.(1)(2)Every vector f = ( f e)e∈E that satisfies the above two conditions is called an edge flow, and f g is called the edge flowinduced by the route flow g. The set of route flows is denoted by Δ(RO), and the set of edge flows is denoted by F . Henceevery route flow g ∈ Δ(RO) induces an edge flow f g ∈ F , but it is obvious, and well known that not every edge flow isinduced by some route flow. A sufficient condition for an edge flow to be induced by a route flow is given below. A cyclein G is a simple closed directed path. Let f be an edge flow, and let C be a cycle. We say that C is positive with respect tofif f e > 0 for every e ∈ C .Lemma 1. Let N be a 2-terminal congestion network. Every flow f with no positive cycles is induced by some route flow.Proof. The proof follows from a more general theorem, named the flow decomposition theorem (see e.g. [2]). (cid:2)Note that an edge flow may be induced by several distinct route flows.3. Routing gamesEvery congestion network, a set of players, and an association of a single source-target pair to each player defines acongestion game, which is called a routing game. In this game every player has to move a unit of good from her sourceto her target. When every player can split her unit amongst the available routes, the associated game is called a splittablerouting game. When the units are not divisible we get an unsplittable routing game. When the congestion network is 2-ter-minal we get a 2-terminal routing game. Obviously, a 2-terminal routing game is a symmetric game. Similarly, a linearcongestion network generates a linear routing game, and a parallel congestion network generates a parallel routing game.7 In this paper we call increasing what other may call strictly increasing.8 The values of de(x) for x < 0 are not relevant to any of our discussions, but it is technically useful to let de be defined over the whole real line.1444I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–14554. Equilibrium in 2-terminal splittable routing games with complete informationLet N = (G, d) be a 2-terminal congestion network, and let I be a non-empty finite set of players. Whenever it isconvenient and harmless we assume that I = {1, . . . , n}, n (cid:2) 1. We are about to define actions and cost functions in thecorresponding 2-terminal splittable routing game denoted by ΓN (I). In this game, every player i chooses a route flow gi ,and thus a route flow profile g = (g1, g2, . . . , gn) ∈ Δ(RO)I is generated. Each such profile of route flows generates a profile ofedge flows, fg = ( f g1 , f g2 , . . . , f gn ) ∈ F I . The cost function of every player, ci(g) would depend on the profile of edge flowsfg via the formulaci(g) = Ci(fg),where Ci : F I → (cid:7) is a function defined over profiles of edge flows as follows:Ci(f) =(cid:5)(cid:6),fei def e(cid:3)e∈Ewherefe =n(cid:3)i=1f eifor every e ∈ E.A route flow profile g is in equilibrium in ΓN (I) ifci(g) (cid:3) ci(hi, g−i)(3)for every player i and for every route flow hi , where g−i denotes the profile of route flows of all players but i.In the following theorem we show that every 2-terminal splittable routing game possesses an equilibrium. We furthershow that although the game may have multiple equilibria, the concept of equilibrium cost is well-defined. That is, thereexists a level of cost c(n) such that in every equilibrium profile g in ΓN (I), every player pays c(n). That is, ci(g) = c(n) forevery player i.9Theorem 1. Let N = (G, d) be a 2-terminal congestion network, let n be a positive integer, and let I be a set of n players.1. ΓN (I) possesses an equilibrium.2. There exists a symmetric profile of edge flows, f[n] = ( f [n], . . . , f [n]) such that every equilibrium route flow profile in ΓN (I)induces f. That is, for every equilibrium g, fg = f[n].3. Consequently, there exists a level of cost, c(n) such that in every equilibrium of ΓN (I) every player pays c(n); c(n) is called theequilibrium cost in ΓN (I).Proof. It is useful to extend the splittable routing game to a game in which the players can choose edge flows directly. Inthis game, which we call the edge flow splittable routing game and denote it by ˜ΓN (I), every player is able to choose an edgeflow rather then just a route flow. Hence, the action set of every player is F , and the cost function of player i is given in (3).It was proved in Theorem 5 in [16] that there exists a unique equilibrium in ˜ΓN (I). Obviously every permutation of thisequilibrium profile is also an equilibrium implying that the unique equilibrium must be symmetric. In order to completethe proof of the theorem we have to relate route equilibrium profiles in the splittable routing game ΓN (I) to the uniqueedge equilibrium profile in ˜ΓN (I).Let f an equilibrium in ˜ΓN (I). Since the edge cost functions are positive in (0, ∞) every edge flow f i does not containis anis induced by some route flow gi . Finally, observe that if g ∈ Δ(RO)Ia positive cycle. Therefore by Lemma 1 f iequilibrium in ΓN (I) then fg is an equilibrium profile in ˜ΓN (I). (cid:2)5. Equilibrium in 2-terminal splittable routing games with an unknown set of active playersSplittable routing games with unknown active players, are pre-Bayesian games as discussed in [3] and [1]. In this paperwe don’t use the general concept but rather use the concept in our particular setup. Let N be a 2-terminal congestionnetwork, and let I = {1, 2, . . . , n} be a finite set of potential players.Terminology: During our discussion we will deal with splittable routing games of the form ΓN (K ), where K ⊆ I is a non-empty subset of players. The cost function of player i ∈ K at this game should be denoted by c K. However, with a slightii , where k = |K |. In addition, whenever the set of players and their number is clearabuse of notation we will denote it by ckwe may also omit the superscript k.9 It is shown in [5] that uniqueness fails outside 2-terminal networks.I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–14551445A state is a non-empty subset of players, K . That is, the set of states is Ω = 2I \ {∅}. The set of active players at thestate K is K . An active player knows that he is active, but he does not know the true state. Hence, an active player doesnot know who or how many players are active. All such a player knows is an upper bound on the number of active players,determined by the number of potential players. In a 2-terminal splittable routing game with unknown active players, denotedby HN (I), at every state K the players in K are playing the game ΓN (K ), but they do not know it. A strategy for everypotential player i in HN (I) is a route flow gi , which he will use once he is active. Note however, that an active playercannot compute his cost even if he knows the complete route flow profile g = (gi)ni=1. All he knows is that he will geti (gK) if the set of active players is K , where gK = (gi)i∈K . When players are considering worst-case scenarios regardingckthe missing information about the set of active players, and they are in equilibrium, they form a safety-level equilibrium asdefined in [1].Formally, in our context, a profile of route flows g is a safety level equilibrium in HN (I) if for every player i the minimalvalue of max{K ⊆I|i∈K } cki (hi, gK\{i}) over all hi ∈ Δ(RO) is obtained at hi = gi .Since all cost functions are increasing the worst case scenario, that is max{K ⊆I|i∈K } ckK = I . Therefore, we obtain the following result:i (hi, gK\{i}), is obtained in stateLemma 2. Let N = (G, d) be a 2-terminal congestion network, and let I be a finite set of players. Let g ∈ Δ(RO)I be a route flow profile.g is a safety-level equilibrium in the associated routing game with incomplete information HN (I) if and only if g is an equilibrium inthe associated game with complete information ΓN (I).Proof. Assume g ∈ Δ(RO)Istatement of this lemma,is an equilibrium in ΓN (I). Let i be an active player. By the comment we made before theminhi ∈Δ(R O )max{K ⊆I|i∈K }i (hi, gK\{i}) = minckhi∈Δ(RO)cni (hi, g).(4)Because g is an equilibrium in ΓN (I), the min in the right-hand side of Eq. (4) is attained at gi . Therefore, g is a safety-levelequilibrium in HN (I). An analogous argument proves the if part of the lemma. (cid:2)Theorem 1 and Lemma 2 imply that when there are n potential players and k active players, each of the active playersis using at every safety-level equilibrium a route flow that induces the edge flow f [n], which is the edge flow induced inequilibrium in the complete information game with n players. Let c(k, n) be the actual cost of each of the active k playerswhen each of them is using f [n]. That is, for an arbitrary player i,(cid:5)(cid:6)c(k, n) = C kif[n]K.6. The value of ignorance – splittable gamesWe proceed to analyze the value of ignorance in 2-terminal splittable routing games as a function of the relationshipbetween the number of active participants, k, and the number of potential participants, n.Consider a 2-terminal congestion network N = (G, d), and the associated splittable routing game with unknown activeplayers, HN (I), where |I| = n. Suppose that the real state of the world is K where |K | = k and k < n. If this state iscommonly known then each player i ∈ K pays c(k). If the real state is unknown then every active player pays c(k, n) asdefined at the end of the previous section. Therefore it is natural to call the difference, c(k) − c(k, n) the value of ignorance.We denote the value of ignorance by ν(k, n). That is,ν(k, n) = c(k) − c(k, n).The value of ignorance indicates how much players “enjoy” the ignorance about the actual set of players. Observe thatignorance is beneficial (in a weak sense) for the players if and only if ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0. In the following example we demonstratethe value of ignorance in a parallel routing game.Example 1. Consider the congestion network N in Fig. 1. Let I = {1, 2, 3}, i.e. there are 3 potential players. Let the realstate be K = {1, 2}. Hence, there are two active players. First we find the equilibrium in the routing game with completeinformation with two players. Assume the first player sends y (cid:2) 0 on the upper edge and 1 − y (cid:2) 0 on the lower edge. Thenthe second player’s objective is to minimize x(x + y) + (1 − x)(1 − x + 1 − y + 1), where x is the amount she will send on theupper edge. The solution to this is x = 2− y2 . Since by Theorem 1 the induced edge flow profile in equilibrium is symmetric,it must be that x = y. Therefore x = 23 . The cost for each of the players in this case is c(2) = 2+ 1) = 139 .∗ ( 23+ 13∗ 43We next find the equilibrium in the splittable routing game with complete information with three players.Assuming the total amount two players send in the upper edge is y (cid:2) 0, then the third player’s objective is to minimizex(x + y) + (1 − x)(1 − x + 2 − y + 1), where x is the amount she will send on the upper edge. The solution to this is x = 5−2 y.By the symmetry of the induced edge flow profile in equilibrium we obtain x = 5−4x8 . If the state K is4not known to the players, then by playing the safety-level equilibrium each of the players in K will send 58 in the upper− 23+ 3edge an therefore their costs will be c(2, 3) = 516 > 0.816 . Hence the value of ignorance is ν(2, 3) = 13and therefore x = 5+ 1) = 23∗ 1088 ( 634891446I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–1455Fig. 1.In Example 1 we showed that the value of ignorance may be positive. In our next results we show a rich class of gamesin which this phenomenon occurs. In the next section we proceed to estimate the value of ignorance in linear splittablerouting games in general 2-terminal congestion networks. More refined results will be obtained in the section following itfor parallel networks.6.1. Linear 2-terminal splittable routing gamesThe following is our main result for splittable routing games:Theorem 2. Let N = (G, d) be a linear 2-terminal congestion network. Let k, n (cid:2) 1 be integers. If 2k − 1 (cid:2) n > k then ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0,and ν(k, n − 1) (cid:3) ν(k, n). Moreover, if there exists an edge e for which f e[n] admits at least two different values at the intervaln ∈ [k, 2k − 1], the above inequalities are strict.The key to the proof of Theorem 2 is Lemma 3 below. Recall that f [n] is the unique edge flow equilibrium profilein ΓN (I). In this lemma we show that if there are n (cid:2) 1 players and these players are restricted to use the same edgeflow, then the cost is minimized when all player use the edge flow f [2n − 1]. First we need some preparations. Let n (cid:2) 1and t (cid:2) 1. We consider the following two optimization problems, PRi,n and SYMt . In PRi,n there are n players, and player ioptimizes her cost (chooses an edge flow) given that all other players but i use the edge flow f [n].

Formally,(SYM)t: minf ∈F(cid:3)e∈E(cid:5)(cid:6)f eaet2 + be f e.The following lemma is a key in our proof of Theorem 2. We show that if there are t players for some t (cid:2) 1, and all playersare restricted to use the same edge flow then the optimal cost will be attained f [2t − 1]. The lemma also provides a usefuland related inequality. Lemma 3 and its proof are in the spirit of Lemma 4.3 in [18].10 The proof idea is as follows. Supposef [n] optimizes for i thethere are n (cid:2) 1 players. Since by Theorem 1 ( f [n], . . . , f [n]) is the unique edge flow equilibrium,cost in problem PRi,n. Therefore, the cost for i in the second optimization is lower or equal than the cost for i in the firstoptimization problem. Both problems are convex optimization problems, and as it turns out the KKT conditions of thesetwo optimization problems are very similar also due to the linearity of the cost functions. The relation between the KKTconditions yields our result.Lemma 3. Let N = (G, d) be a linear congestion network and let n (cid:2) 1. f ∈ F is a solution to (SYM)n if and only if f = f [2n − 1].

Recall that an edge flow is a vector f ∈ R E that satisfies conditions (1) and (2). However,the right-hand side of (3) is well-defined for every vector indexed by the edges. This enables us to extend the cost functionsCi to ((cid:7)E )I .10 The model in [18] is the non-atomic model, where each player carries a negligible amount of load. Their lemma nor their proof does not imply ourlemma.I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–14551447Let f ∈ ((cid:7)E )I . The marginal cost of each user i ∈ I on the edge e with respect to f eiis∂ Ci(f)∂ f ei(cid:6)(cid:5)fe= de+ f ei∂de(fe)∂fe.We further need the following notation. For every fictitious edge flow profile f and every couple of reals α, β ∈ (cid:7) letK i(f, α, β) = ∂ Ci (f)∂ f ei+ α − β.As the objective function in PRi,n is convex, and all constraints are defined by linear inequalities and equalities, PRi,n is aconvex minimization problem with linear constraints.Therefore by KKT theorem in Appendix A, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are provided by the Karush–f i ∈ F is an optimal solution for PRi,n if and only if there exist Lagrange multipliersKuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions.

Therefore by setting t = k/ n+1Next we show that ν(k, n) is non-increasing in n for n (cid:2) 2k − 1.Theorem 3. Let N = (G, d) be a linear congestion network. Let k (cid:2) 1 be an integer. ν(k, n + 1) (cid:3) ν(k, n) for every n such thatn (cid:2) 2k − 1.Proof. We need the following claim.Claim 2 (Punishment lemma). Let ρk (cid:2) 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , be an increasing sequence of real numbers. Let F : RmG : Rmx ∈ D ⊂ Rm+ → R+ and let+ × N → R+ by H(x, k) = F (x) + ρk G(x).

Together, when we fix the number k (cid:2) 1 of active players,Theorems 2 and 3 imply the following structure of the function ν(k, n) for k (cid:3) n < ∞: It is non-negative and non-decreasingat the interval [k, 2k − 1], and it is non-increasing at the interval [2k − 1, ∞).More information about this function is obtained for parallel routing games as is shown at the next section. For suchgames, if k is sufficiently large, it is proved that ν(k, n) vanishes at n = k(k + 1) − 1. Consequently, for n (cid:2) k(k + 1), the valueof ignorance is not positive. That is, knowledge is a desirable good.6.2. Linear splittable parallel routing gamesIn this section we deal with a linear parallel congestion network, N = (G, d) in which de(x) = ae x + be for every edge e.Theorem 4. Let N = (G, d) be a parallel and linear congestion network. There exist an integer T (N ) such that for every k (cid:2) T (N ).1. ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0 for every k(k + 1) − 1 > n > k.

Unsplittable routing gamesIn an unsplittable routing game a player cannot split her unit, and therefore she has to choose a single route thatconnects her source to her target. Unsplittable routing games are a special type of congestion games as defined by [17].Therefore, by [17] each such game has a pure strategy equilibrium. However, a symmetric equilibrium in a symmetricunsplittable routing game cannot, in general, be pure. Hence, in general, an unsplittable symmetric routing game will havemore than one equilibrium profile, and moreover, it can be easily verified that it would have more than one equilibriumcost. Hence, the existence of a unique equilibrium cost, which was crucial for our analysis of the value of ignorance inthe splittable model is not guaranteed in the unsplittable model. One can hope that when restricting attention only tosymmetric (necessarily mixed-action) equilibrium we will have a unique equilibrium cost. This is indeed our conjecture.However, we have been able to prove this conjecture only for parallel unsplittable routing games. Therefore, in what followswe will deal only with parallel routing games. Parallel routing games are also called, for obvious reasons, resource selectiongames, and we will refer to them with the later name.7.1. Equilibrium in resource selection games with complete informationLet N = (G, d) be a parallel congestion network. The graph G is practically defined by the set of parallel edges E ={1, 2, . . . , m}. Therefore we will use the notation N = (E, d). Every edge j ∈ E is called a resource. When we dealt withsplittable models we assumed that every cost function d j is defined over [0, ∞) and it is positive, increasing, convex andcontinuously differentiable. When dealing with unsplittable models we assume d j is defined only for positive integers, andthat it is increasing and non-negative. Let I be a set of n players. Let ΓN (I) be the unsplittable parallel routing game definedby N and I , which we call a resource selection game.The action set of every player i in ΓN (I) is the set of resources E. For every profile of resources x ∈ En let σ j(x) be thei (x) = dxi (σxi (x)) be the cost of player i when the players use the resourcenumber of all players i ∈ I for which xi = j. Let cnprofile x.Let p ∈ Δ(E) be a mixed action of an arbitrary player. That is, p = (p1, . . . , pm), where p j is the probability that a playerwho uses the mixed action p will select resource j. We denote the support of p by supp(p). That is supp(p) = { j ∈ E |p j > 0}. Denote by cn(p, j) the expected cost of a player that chooses resource j when each of the other n − 1 players inΓN (I) is using‘p. Let cn(p) be the expected cost of every player when each of the n players in ΓN (I) is choosing p.α(k) = P (Y n(cid:5)αnα . Obviouslyk∼ Bin(n, α) be a binomial random variable. That is, f n(cid:3) k) be the cumulative distribution function of Y nα(k) = P (Y nαFor every n (cid:2) 1, and for every 0 (cid:3) α (cid:3) 1, let Y n(cid:6)ααk(1 − α)n−k for every 0 (cid:3) k (cid:3) n. Let F n(cid:5)= k) =(cid:6)(cid:6)cn(p, j) = E(cid:5)d j1 + Y n−1p j,where E stands for the expectation operator. That is,cn(p, j) =n−1(cid:3)s=0d j(s + 1) f n−1p j(s).(16)(17)Let (q, . . . , q) ∈ Δ(E)n be a symmetric mixed-action equilibrium profile in ΓN (I). We will refer to q as a symmetric-equilibrium mixed action.Theorem 5. Every resource selection game with at least two players and with increasing12 resource cost functions possesses a uniquesymmetric mixed-action equilibrium.In order to prove Theorem 5 we need some preparations.The following lemma is well known, and is left as an exercise to the reader.Lemma 5. Let n (cid:2) 1. F nα(k) is a strictly decreasing function of α for every 0 (cid:3) k (cid:3) n − 1.In the following lemma we show that if all players choose the same mixed action, then the expected cost for a playerthat uses resource j is increasing with the probability that resource j is given by the players.Lemma 6. Let ΓN (I) be a resource selection game with at least two players. Let q, p ∈ Δ(E) be mixed actions, and let j ∈ E be aresource such that d j is increasing in {1, 2, . . . , n}. If p j > q j then cn(p, j) > cn(q, j).Proof. We have to show that cn(p, j) is increasing in p j .By manipulating (17)12 That is, d j (k) < d j (k + 1) for all j and k.I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–14551451cn(p, j) =(cid:17)n−1(cid:3)k=1(cid:5)d j(k) − d j(k + 1)(cid:6) k−1(cid:3)(cid:18)f n−1p j(l)l=0n−1(cid:3)+ d j(n)l=0(cid:20)f n−1p j(l)(cid:19)= d j(n) −n−1(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6)d j(k + 1) − d j(k)k=1where the last equality follows from the fact thatF n−1p j(k − 1),(cid:2)n−1k=0 f n−1p j(k) = 1.By Lemma 5, F n−1p j(k) is strictly decreasing in p j for every k = 0, . . . , n − 2. In addition, d j is strictly increasing, andtherefore cn(p, j) is strictly increasing in p j . (cid:2)We are now ready to prove Theorem 5. Roughly speaking, the proof follows since all resources in the support must havethe same expected cost in equilibrium, and if in negation there are two different equilibria then at least two resources areassigned different probabilities in these equilibria.Proof of Theorem 5. We only need to prove the uniqueness.13 Suppose in negation that there is more than one mixed-action symmetric equilibrium in ΓN (I). Let q and p be two symmetric equilibrium actions with p (cid:5)= q. Since p (cid:5)= q thereexists j ∈ E with q j (cid:5)= p j . W.l.o.g. q j > p j . Therefore there exist a resource r ∈ E such that r (cid:5)= j and qr < pr . We get acontradiction from the following sequence of inequalities: cn(q, j) > cn(p, j) (cid:2) cn(p, r) > cn(q, r) (cid:2) cn(q, j), where the strictinequalities follow from Lemma 6 and the other inequalities hold because q and p are equilibrium actions. (cid:2)For every n (cid:2) 1 we will denote the unique symmetric equilibrium mixed action in ΓN (I) by pn, and we denote byc(n) = cn(pn) the equilibrium cost of a player in ΓN (I).We say that a resource cost function d j is convex if it can be extended to a convex function on [1, ∞).The following lemma will be useful later. It states that when resource cost functions are convex, then for a sufficientnumber of players the support of the unique symmetric equilibrium is full.Lemma 7. Let N = (E, d) be a parallel congestion network with increasing and convex cost functions. There exists an integer T (cid:2) 2,T = T (N ) such that for every n (cid:2) T , the unique symmetric-equilibrium mixed action in the game ΓN (I), pn ∈ Δ(E), has a fullsupport. That is, pnr > 0 for every 1 (cid:3) r (cid:3) m.Proof. Recall that pn is the unique symmetric-equilibrium mixed action in ΓN (I), and that c(n) = cn(pn) is the symmetric-equilibrium cost of every player. As pn is an equilibrium mixed action, cn(pn, j) = c(n) for every j ∈ supp(pn). For everyresource j we denote by d j the convex extension of d j to [0, ∞). As d j is convex,(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:5)cnpn, j= E(cid:5)d j(cid:5)1 + Y n−1pnj(cid:2) d j1 + E= d j1 + pnY n−1pnj(cid:6)j (n − 1),where the first equality follows from (16), the inequality follows from the convexity of d j .Obviously, there exists j ∈ supp(p) for which pnjc(n) = cn(cid:5)(cid:6)pn, j(cid:2) d j(cid:11)1 + 1m(cid:12)(n − 1)(cid:2)(cid:2) 1m . For this resource j(cid:11)1 + 1m(n − 1)dr(cid:12).mminr=1Therefore since for every resource j, d j is increasing and convex, limn→∞ c(n) = ∞. Hence, there exists T such that for everyr > 0 for every 1 (cid:3) r (cid:3) m, otherwise a player will benefit from deviating an (cid:2) T c(n) > maxm(cid:11)resource rj=1 d j(1). This implies that pn= 0. (cid:2)for which pnr7.2. Resource selection games with an unknown set of active playersConsider a fixed parallel congestion network N = (E, d) with the set of resources E = {1, . . . , m}, m (cid:2) 1, and resourcecost functions d = (d j)mj=1. Let I = {1, 2, . . . , n}, n (cid:2) 1, be the set of potential players.Analogously to what we did in Section 5, we proceed to describe the associated resource selection game with unknownset of active players.A state is a non-empty subset, K of players. That is, the set of states is Ω = 2I \ {∅}. The set of active players at thestate K is K itself. An active player knows that he is active, but he does not know the true state. Hence, an active playerknows nothing about the other players (except for an upper bound determined by the number of potential players), and inparticular he does not know the number of active players. In a resource selection game with unknown active players, denoted13 Existence is proved in [15].1452I. Ashlagi et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1441–1455by HN (I), at every state K the players in K are playing the game ΓN (K ), but they do not know it. The lack of knowledgeabout the set of active players does not have an effect on the set of strategies available to each potential player. A strategyfor every potential player i in HN (I) is a resource xi ∈ E, which he will use once he is active. A mixed strategy for i is,therefore, a probability distribution q[i] ∈ Δ(E). Note however, that an active player cannot compute his cost even if heknows the complete resource profile x = (xi)ni (xK) if the set of active players is K ,where xK = (xi)i∈K . When players are considering worst-case scenarios regarding the missing information about the set ofactive players, they are using mixed strategies, and they are in equilibrium, they form a mixed strategy safety-level equilibriumas described in Section 5. Formally, a profile μ = (q[1], . . . , q[n]) of mixed strategies in HN (I) is a mixed strategy safety-i (p[i], μK \{i}) over all p[i] ∈ Δ(E) is obtained atlevel equilibrium if for every player i the minimal value of max{K ⊆I|i∈K } ckp[i] = q[i].∈ En. All he knows is that he will get cki=1Since all cost functions are increasing the worst case scenario, that is max{K ⊆I|i∈K } cki (p[i], μK\{i}), is obtained in the stateK = I . Therefore, we obtain the following result whose proof is omitted because of its similarity to the proof of Lemma 2.Lemma 8. Let N = (E, d) be a parallel congestion network, and let I be a finite set of players. Let μ ∈ Δ(E)I be a mixed action profile.μ is a mixed strategy safety-level equilibrium in the resource selection game with incomplete information HN (I) if and only if μ is amixed action equilibrium in ΓN (I).We proceed to prove a uniqueness result:Theorem 6. Let N be a parallel congestion network in which the resource cost functions are increasing, and let I be a set of n players.HN (I) has a unique mixed strategy symmetric safety-level equilibrium. In this mixed strategy symmetric safety-level equilibrium everyplayer is using the mixed strategy pn, where pn is the unique symmetric-equilibrium mixed action in ΓN (I).Proof. The proof follows directly from Theorem 5 and Lemma 8. (cid:2)By Theorem 6, each of the players in HN (I) is using the mixed strategy pn, where pn is the unique symmetric-equilibrium mixed action in ΓN (I). However, the cost of each active player in HN (I) is not c(n) = cn(pn), and dependson the true state. If the true state is K , that is K is the set of active players, and |K | = k, the cost of each active player i isck(pn). Denote this cost by c(k, n).8. The value of ignorance – unsplittable routing gamesAs we did in the splittable routing model we denote the value of ignorance by ν(k, n). That is,ν(k, n) = c(k) − c(k, n).Theorem 7. Let N be a linear and parallel congestion network with increasing resource cost functions. There exist an integerT = T (N ), T (cid:2) 2 such that for all n > k (cid:2) T :1. ν(k, n) (cid:2) 0.2. All inequalities above are strict if and only if there exists j1, j2 ∈ E such that d j2 (1) (cid:5)= d j1 (1).Proof. 1. Let j ∈ E. By Lemma 7 there exist an integer T such that for every n (cid:2) T the unique symmetric equilibrium mixedaction in ΓN (I) has full support for every set of players, I , with n players. We show that c(k) (cid:2) c(k, n) for every n > k (cid:2) T .Since pk is an equilibrium in ΓN (K ) where K is a set of k players, then ck(pk, j) = ck(pk, r) for every pair of resourcesj, r ∈ supp(pk). Since pk has a full support, by (16) andc(k) = ck(cid:6)(cid:5)pk= d j(1) + (k − 1)a j pkj.Similarly,c(k, n) = ck(cid:5)(cid:6)pn==m(cid:3)j=1m(cid:3)j=1(cid:5)(cid:6)pn, jj ckpn(cid:13)c(n) − (n − k)a j pnj(cid:14)pnj= c(n) − (n − k)(cid:5)(cid:6)2.pnja jm(cid:3)j=1It remains to show thatc(n) − c(k) (cid:3) (n − k)(cid:5)(cid:6)2.pnja jm(cid:3)j=1(18)(19)I.

This is immediate since for every couple of resources j, r ∈ E such that j (cid:5)= r, (d j(1))2 +(dr(1))2 (cid:2) 2d j(1)dr(1).2. Observe that L A − B2 = 0 if and only if d j(1) = dr(1) for every j, r ∈ E. (cid:2)We further analyze the properties of the function ν(k, n) in linear models:Theorem 8. Let N be a parallel congestion network with linear and increasing resource cost functions. There exist T such that thefollowing assertions hold:1. For every n (cid:2) T pna j , and B =j2. For every k (cid:2) T , for a set of k players, K , the minimal social cost in ΓN (K ) attained with symmetric mixed-action profiles is, where A =Aa j (n−1)mj=1mj=11.= n−1+B−d j (1) Ad j (1)a jattained at p2k−1. Consequently, ν(k, n) = c(k) − c(k, n) is maximized for a fixed k at n = 2k − 1.(cid:2)(cid:2)+ B−d j (1) AAa j (n−1)= 1Aa jProof. Let qnj1. Observe that for every n (cid:2) T qnj > 0 for every j ∈ E.= 1. Let n (cid:2) T . In order to provethat qn is in equilibrium it suffices to prove that for every player i, if all players but i play the mixed-action qn then playeri is indifferent between all resources. That is we want to show thatfor every j ∈ E. Let T be the smallest integer t such that qtmj=1 qnjj > 0 for every j ∈ E. Notice that for every n,(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:5)qn, jcn(cid:6)(cid:5)qn, r= cnfor every j, r ∈ E. Indeed, cn(qn, j) = d j(1) + (n − 1)a jqnj= n−1A+ BA , which doesn’t depend on j.(cid:2)2. Let k (cid:2) T . We need to show that ck(p) =mj=1 p jck(p, j) is minimized over p ∈ Δ(E) at p = p2k−1.

Discussion and future workIn this work we have shown that between knowing or not knowing the number of active players in a routing game,players are often better off not knowing this number. Our work is just a first step in analyzing the value of ignorance incongestion games. The main point we leave open is the analysis of the value of ignorance in the unsplittable setting in ageneral (not parallel) network. To answer this one needs to answer whether in every symmetric equilibrium the cost ofa player is identical, which is an intriguing question on its own. In this paper we focused on the linear setting, a naturalcandidate when one treats the cost function of an edge as its associated delay. Characterizing the value of ignorance forconcave/convex cost functions is a direct extension to this work, which we leave as an open question.In our setting players choose the worst case scenario under the incomplete information setting. One might think that thisbehavior may be too conservative for the players. This suggests one may also consider a study of a corresponding Bayesiansetting, where there exists a common prior distribution over the number of active players, and players wish to minimizetheir expected costs.A central related topic that was studied extensively in the last decade is the “price of anarchy”, namely the ratio betweenthe social cost in a worst equilibrium and the optimal social cost (see e.g. [18,11]). Intuitively the larger this number is,the more “social cost” is lost due to selfish behavior. The price of anarchy has been studied under a complete informationsetting. As our results suggest, one way to reduce the price of anarchy but still allow selfish behavior is to “make sure”the number of active participants remains unknown. In this paper we do not quantify the exact amount (nor give an upperbound) on how much players gain from not knowing the number of participants. We leave this as an intriguing openproblem.Other directions to proceed are:– Assume players adopt other qualitative decision criteria, such as minmax regret.– Assume players have different upper bounds on the number of active players.– Study different types of incomplete information, e.g., assume the edge cost functions are not common knowledge.Appendix A. The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditionsIn this section we describe the relevant theory of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions that is required in ourproofs. The material is taken from [4].Consider the following problem:(cid:21)(IC) minf (x): g j(x) (cid:3) 0, j = 1, . . . , m, hk(x) = 0, k = 1, . . . , p, xi (cid:2) 0, i = 1, . . . , n, x ∈ Rn(cid:22).We say that (IC) is a convex program iff , g1, . . . , gm are real valued convex and differentiable functions on (cid:7)n, andh1, . . . , h p are linear.For every x ∈ (cid:7)n letL(x) = f (x) +m(cid:3)j=1μ j g j(x) +p(cid:3)k=1λkhk(x).The following are the well known Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions at a feasible point x∗:⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩KKTThere exist Lagrange multipliers μ j,and λk, k = 1, . . . , p, such thatμ j g j(x∗)∂ L(x∂ xi∗) = 0, μ j (cid:2) 0, j = 1, . . . , m,= 0,(cid:2) 0,∂ L(x∂ xi∗xii = 1, . . . , n.∗)j = 1, . . . , m,be a feasible solution to (IC). If there exists+ such that at ¯x the non-linear g j are strictly negative, and linear g j are non-positive then the KKT conditions are both necessaryThe Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) Theorem. Let (IC) be a convex program and let x¯x ∈ Rn∗and sufficient for xto be optimal for (IC).∗References[1] M. Aghassi, D.
