IntroductionThe Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions is an important approach to deal withuncertainty in AI.In the theory, belief functions are defined on Boolean algebras ofevents. In many applications of belief functions in real world problems, however, theobjects that we manipulate is no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice. Inthis paper, we employ Birkhoff’s representation theorem for finite distributive lattices toextend the Dempster–Shafer theory to the setting of distributive lattices, which has amathematical theory as attractive as in that of Boolean algebras. Moreover, we use thismore general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in adeductive approach on non-classical formalisms which assume a setting of distributivelattices. As an illustration of this approach, we investigate the theory of belief functionsfor a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R byproviding an axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions for this logic and byshowing that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respectto the class of the corresponding Dempster–Shafer structures is NP-complete.© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Dealing with uncertainty is a fundamental issue for Artificial Intelligence [31]. Numerous approaches have been pro-posed, including Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions (also called Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence). Ever sincethe pioneering works by Dempster [10] and Shafer [52], belief functions were brought into a practically usable form bySmets [59] and have become a standard tool in Artificial Intelligence for knowledge representation and decision-making.Dempster–Shafer belief functions on a finite frame of discernment S are defined on the power set of S, which is aBoolean algebra. They have an attractive mathematical theory and many intuitively appealing properties. Belief functionssatisfy the three axioms which generalize the Kolmogorov axioms for probability functions. Interestingly enough, they canalso be characterized in terms of mass functions m. Intuitively, for a subset event A, m( A) measures the belief that an agentcommits exactly to A, not the total belief that an agent commits to A. Shafer [52] showed that an agent’s belief in A is thesum of the masses he has assigned to all the subsets of A. This characterization of belief functions through mass functionsis simply an example of the well-known Inclusion–Exclusion principle in Enumerative Combinatorics [61] and hence has astrong combinatorial flavor. In this theory, mass functions are recognized as Möbius transforms of belief functions.Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions is closely related to other approaches dealing with uncertainty. It includesthe Bayesian theory [51] as a special case. The first three rules of the Bayesian theory are simply those three axioms forprobability functions. It is shown [52] that a belief function on S is Bayesian (also a probability function) if and only if✩This is an expanded and improved version of a preliminary paper with the same title that appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conferenceon Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12), 1968–1975, Toronto, 2012. All the technical proofs here are not published in the AAAI paper. In some sense, the prooftechniques developed in this paper are as important as the main results. In addition, Sections 3 and 4in the conference paper are totally revised andreplaced by more comprehensive sections, and some main results there get strengthened in this paper.E-mail addresses: czhou@ruc.edu.cn, chunlai.zhou@gmail.com.0004-3702/$ – see front matter © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

So a Bayesian belief function μ is more like apoint function than a set function in its level of complexity in the sense that μ is determined by its values at singletonsrather by its values at all events (its values at other non-singletons are 0). This implies that generally Bayesian belieffunctions are simpler and easier to describe than belief functions. As Shafer pointed out in Chapter 9 of his book [52],this simplicity makes the Bayesian belief functions awkward for the representation of evidence. In practice, the Bayesianapproach is criticized for having difficulty in efficiently providing reasonable estimate of the probability of some eventsand for describing confidence by a single point rather than a range [18]. The main advantage of the Dempster–Shafertheory over the Bayesian theory is that it allows for a proper representation of ignorance under incomplete information andassigns a meaningful interval to an event as a representation of the uncertainty of the event. In this aspect, the theory ofbelief functions is equivalent to the approach adopted by Fagin and Halpern [18] dealing with uncertainty using inner andouter probability measures. In contrast with the Dempster–Shafer theory, probability theory does not assign a probabilityto every event [30] and probability measures are defined on a σ -algebra, which is a subclass of the power set of the spaceunder consideration. Non-measurable events, those without probabilities, are usually considered as meaningless in probabilitytheory. However, in modeling uncertainty in artificial intelligence, they are used to represent those events to which an agenthas insufficient information to assign probabilities. A non-measurable event E is provided with inner probability measure(outer probability measure) which is the probability of the largest measurable event contained in E (the smallest measurableone containing E). The inner (outer) measure gives a lower bound (upper bound) on the agent’s degree of beliefs in E. Soinner probability measure (together with outer probability measure) induced by probability measure assigns an intervalto every event as a representation of uncertainty of the event E, which is similar to belief/plausibility functions. Moreover,belief functions and inner probability measures are equivalent on formulas [18]. There is an immediate payoff to this view ofDempster–Shafer belief functions: a logic for reasoning about belief functions can be obtained from that for inner probabilitymeasures [19].The first investigation of mathematical properties of belief functions on more general lattices was initiated by Barthélemy[4] with the combinatorial theory on lattices by Rota [47], which was motivated by possible applications of belief functionsfor non-standard representation of knowledge. Grabisch [26] continued along this direction and showed that such propertiesas Dempster’s rule of combination and Smets’s canonical decomposition [57] in the case of Boolean algebras can be trans-posed in general lattice setting. This generalized theory has been applied to many objects in real world problems that maynot form a Boolean algebra. Let us give some examples: set-valued variables in multi-label classification [13,70], the set ofpartitions in ensemble clustering [39] and bi-capacities in cooperative game theory [29]. Because of its generality, however,Grabisch’s theory loses many intuitively appealing properties in the Dempster–Shafer theory. For example, since a latticedoes not necessarily admit a probability function [26], belief functions in general lattice settings fail to maintain a closeconnection with the Bayesian theory and therefore lack many of the desirable properties associated with this theory asin Dempster–Shafer theory [18]. Since pignistic probabilities are used for decision-making in the transferable belief modelby Smets [65,58], it would be impossible to develop decision theory for general lattice structures along a similar line. Inparticular, most non-classical formalisms1 in AI assume a setting of distributive lattices and hence it would be difficult toapply Grabisch’s theory directly to obtain a deductive approach for reasoning about belief functions over these formalismsas developed in Section 5 of this paper. Our deductive approach requires a setting of distributive lattices. Moreover, in manyreal-world problems such as evidential reasoning on fuzzy events [68,55,56,66] and bipolar belief pairs on vague proposi-tions [36] which do assume a setting of distributive lattices, belief functions are defined in totally different forms. It wouldbe desirable to establish a uniform theory for all these applications of belief functions.An optimal balance between utility and elegance of a theory of belief functions is achieved for distributive lattices, whichis the main contribution of this paper. Not only does our approach for distributive lattices yield a mathematical theoryas appealing as Dempster–Shafer theory, but also its applications extend to many non-classical formalisms of structures inArtificial Intelligence (quantum theory [67] is one of very few important exceptions). The main difficulty in the extension ishow to characterize the class of belief functions without reference to mass assignments. Birkhoff’s fundamental theorem forfinite distributive lattices solves this problem. Through this characterization, many fundamental properties of belief functionsin the Boolean case are also preserved in distributive lattices. Just as in the Dempster–Shafer theory, we obtain nice formulasfor Möbius functions of distributive lattices. We show that, for any lattice (not necessarily distributive), a capacity is totallymonotone iff its Möbius transform is non-negative, which answers an open question raised in [26] and further justifiesthe proposal by Barthélemy and Grabisch that evidential reasoning can be done naturally on lattices while probabilitytheory can only live on distributive lattices. A more fundamental result is that there is a one-to-one correspondence fromthe perspective viewing belief functions as lower envelopes between belief functions on a distributive lattice L and thoseon its generated Boolean algebra, which is the smallest Boolean algebra of which L is a sublattice. We establish a closeconnection to the Bayesian theory by showing that a belief function Bel on a finite distributive lattice L is Bayesian (ora probability function) if and only if all focal elements i.e., those elements with positive weights assigned by its massfunction are join-irreducible in L. For belief functions, join-irreducibles to distributive lattices are the same as singletons toBoolean algebras. Moreover, we prove by appealing to Smiley’s theory on measurability in lattices [60] that belief functionson distributive lattices can be viewed as generalized probability functions in the sense that Bel is equivalent to the inner1 In this paper, being non-classical means being non-Boolean.C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–313measure induced by some probability function on formulas. This perspective paves the way to our following deductiveapproach for reasoning about belief functions.After establishing the mathematical theory for belief functions on distributive lattices, we use this more general theoryto provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in a deductive approach on non-classical formalisms whichassume a distributive lattice. The integrating of belief functions and non-classical formalisms is intended to master twosources of ignorance. While belief functions take care of the limitation of the information that the agent has at his disposal,non-classical formalisms usually take care of the incompleteness or inconsistency in the knowledge-base due to imperfectdata. So, the advantage of our framework over the well-known work by Fagin and Halpern [18] is that it provides a de-ductive machinery to reason about belief functions for these non-classical formalisms. As an illustration of this deductiveapproach, we deal with belief functions on two particular classes of distributive lattices: bilattices and de Morgan lattices,which are actually mathematical objects in reasoning under incomplete and inconsistent information. A well-known simplenon-Boolean epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment R f de of relevance logic R [1] provides a complete deduc-tive system for this type of non-classical information, which is used to deal with the famous logical-omniscience problem inthe foundations of Knowledge Representation [20,37], and used for reasoning in the presence of inconsistency in knowledgebase systems [38]. A sound and complete axiomatization is provided for the integration of belief functions and the non-classical logic R f de , and finally the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the class ofthe corresponding Dempster–Shafer structures is shown to be NP-complete.Although we have generalized only some important properties in the Dempster–Shafer theory to the setting of distribu-tive lattices, we have no doubt that almost all other important properties in this theory can be transposed in a similar waythrough the techniques developed in this paper. Note that here we mainly focus on the perspective viewing belief functionsas generalized probability functions, which is one of the two perspectives for belief functions pointed out by Halpern andFagin [32]. The rest is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a preliminary background on lattice theory and belieffunctions on lattices, and answer an open question raised by Grabisch [26]. Section 3 is the main part of this paper. Therewe generalize the Dempster–Shafer theory on Boolean algebras to the setting of distributive lattices through Birkhoff’s fun-damental theory for finite distributive lattices, establish a close connection to the Bayesian theory and provide a perspectivefrom which belief functions on distributive lattices can be regarded as generalized probability functions. In Section 4, wepresent the semantical framework for belief functions on both distributive bilattices and de Morgan lattices. In Section 5,we provide a sound and complete deductive system for reasoning about belief functions for the first-degree-entailmentfragment of R and show that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of belief formulas with respect to the class ofthe corresponding Dempster–Shafer structures is NP-complete. And in the final section, we discuss related work and possi-ble applications of our theory in this paper to knowledge representation and decision-making. Appendix A provides someproperties of distributive lattices which are needed in other parts of this paper.2. Belief function on latticesWe will first recall some basic definitions about lattices. Next Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions on Booleanalgebras will be generalized to this more general setting.All posets and lattices occurring in this paper are supposed to be finite. All lattice-theoretical notation and terminologyin this paper follows [61].2.1. LatticesA partially ordered set P (or poset for short) is a set (which by abuse of notation we also call P ), together with a binaryrelation denoted (cid:2), satisfying the following three axioms:1. For all t ∈ P , t (cid:2) t (reflexivity).2. If s (cid:2) t and t (cid:2) s, then s = t (antisymmetry).3. If s (cid:2) t and t (cid:2) u, then s (cid:2) u (transitivity).A subset I of P is called an order ideal (or semi-ideal or down-set or decreasing subset) if, for any x, y ∈ L, x ∈ I pro-vided that x (cid:2) y and y ∈ I . I is called a principal order ideal if I = { y ∈ L: y (cid:2) x} for some x ∈ I . Otherwise, it is called anon-principal order ideal. Dually, a subset F of L is called a dual order ideal (or up-set or increasing subset or filter) if, for anyx, y ∈ L, y ∈ F provided that x (cid:2) y and x ∈ F .A strict partial ordering < is defined from (cid:2) as x < y if x (cid:2) y and x (cid:3)= y. x is said to cover y if x > y and no other(cid:4)element z such that x < z < y. A chain is a poset in which any two elements are comparable. An antichain is a subset Care incomparable. A subset C of a poset P is called a chain if C is a chainof L such that any two distinct elements of Cwhen regarded as an ordered set in its own right. The chain C of P is called saturated (also maximal) if there does not existz ∈ P − C such that x < z < y for some x, y ∈ C and such that C ∪ {z} is a chain. The length l(C) of a finite chain is definedby l(C) := |C| − 1. The height (or rank) of a finite poset is l(P ) := max{C : C is a chain of P }. If every maximal chain of P hasthe same height n, then we say that P is ranked. In this case, the associated rank function ρ : P → {0, 1, . . . , n} is defined as:ρ(x) = 0 if x is a minimal element of P , and ρ( y) = ρ(x) + 1 if y covers x in P .(cid:4)4C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31(cid:4)If s and t belong to a poset P , then an upper bound of s and t is an element u ∈ P satisfying u (cid:3) s and u (cid:3) t. A least upperbound (or join or supremum) of s and t is an upper bound u of s and t such that every upper bound v of s and t satisfiesv (cid:3) u. If a least upper bound exists, then it is clearly unique and is denoted s ∨ t. Dually one can define the greatest lowerbound (or meet or infimum) s ∧ t, when it exists. A lattice is a poset L for which every pair of elements has a least upperbound and greatest lower bound and is denoted (cid:9)L, ∨, ∧(cid:10). When the context is clear, we simply write the lattice as L. Forfinite lattices, the greatest element (denoted (cid:11)) and the least element (denoted ⊥) always exist. An element s of the latticeL is called join-irreducible if s (cid:3)= ⊥ and one cannot write s = t ∨ u where t < s and u < s; otherwise, it is called join-reducible.(cid:4), ∨(cid:4), ∧(cid:4)(cid:10) is called a sublattice of the lattice (cid:9)L, ∨, ∧(cid:10)Meet-irreducible as well as meet-reducible is defined dually. A lattice (cid:9)Lif L(cid:4) ⊆ L and, for any two elements x, y ∈ LFor a given lattice L, a subset I of L is called an ideal if it is an order ideal with respect to the associated partial orderand additionally, for any x, y ∈ L, x ∨ y ∈ I . Dually, a subset F of L is called a filter if it is a dual order ideal (or filter) withrespect to the associated partial order and additionally, for any x, y ∈ F , x ∧ y ∈ F . F is called a prime filter if it satisfies thefollowing additional condition: for any a, b ∈ L, a ∈ F or b ∈ F whenever a ∨ b ∈ F .(cid:4), ∧(cid:4), ∨(cid:4)(cid:10) where L and L(cid:4)x, y ∈ L, h(x ∧ y) = h(x) ∧(cid:4)h( y) and h(x ∨ y) = h(x) ∨(cid:4)one-to-one and onto, then it is called an isomorphism. L can be embedded into L(denoted as L (cid:4) Lare two lattices is called a homomorphism if, for any two elementsh( y). If h is onto, it is called a surjective homomorphism. And if it is(cid:4)if L is isomorphic to a sublattice of LThe map h : (cid:9)L, ∧, ∨(cid:10) → (cid:9)Ly = x ∧ y and x ∨(cid:4)y = x ∨ y., x ∧(cid:4)A lattice L is distributive if (x ∨ y) ∧ z = (x ∧ z) ∨ ( y ∧ z) holds for all x, y, z ∈ L. For any x ∈ L, we say that x has a(cid:4) = (cid:11). L is said to be complemented if every element hascomplement in L if there exists xa complement. Boolean lattices (algebras) are distributive and complemented lattices. In a Boolean lattice, every element hasa unique complement. According to the famous Stone representation theorem, every Boolean lattice is isomorphic to theconcrete Boolean lattice (cid:9)2S , ⊆(cid:10) for some set S. For the lattice (cid:9)2S , ⊆(cid:10), we have ∨ = ∪, ∧ = ∩, (cid:11) = S and ⊥ = ∅.(cid:4) ∈ L such that x ∧ x(cid:4) = ⊥ and x ∨ x).(cid:4)(cid:4)A de Morgan lattice D is a bounded distributive lattice (cid:9)D, ∨, ∧, (cid:11), ⊥(cid:10) with an involution ¬ which satisfies the followingde Morgan’s laws:¬(x ∧ y) = ¬x ∨ ¬ y and ¬¬x = xfor all x, y ∈ D.It follows immediately that ¬(x ∨ y) = ¬x ∧ ¬ y, ¬(cid:11) = ⊥ and ¬⊥ = (cid:11). So ¬ is a dual automorphism. Note that in a deMorgan lattice, the following laws do not always hold:¬x ∨ x = (cid:11) and x ∧ ¬x = ⊥.De Morgan lattices are important for the study of the mathematical aspects of fuzzy logic [69]. The standard fuzzyalgebra F = (cid:9)[0, 1], max(x, y), min(x, y), 0, 1, 1 − x(cid:10) is an example of a de Morgan lattice. Moreover, de Morgan lattices arethe algebraic semantics for the non-classical formalism relevance logic [16].2.2. Belief functions on latticesLet (L, (cid:2)) be a poset having a bottom element ⊥ and a top one (cid:11) and R be the real field. Without further notice, everyfunction in this paper is meant to be a real-valued map. The Möbius function μ : L2 → R of L is defined recursively by⎧⎨μ(x, y) =⎩(cid:5)1−0x(cid:2)t< y μ(x, t)if x = y,if x < y,if x > y.Note that μ solely depends on L.Proposition 2.1 (Möbius inversion formula). (See Proposition 3.7.1 in [61].) Let P be a poset. Let f and g be two functions. Theng(t) =if and only iff (t) =f (s)for all t ∈ Pg(s)μ(s, t)for all t ∈ P ,(1)(2)(cid:6)s(cid:2)t(cid:6)s(cid:2)twhere μ is the Möbius function of P .The function fin the above proposition is called the Möbius transform of g. And the co-Möbius transform2 of g, denotedby q, is defined as: for any x ∈ P ,2 This notion was coined in [28].q(x) =(cid:6)y(cid:3)xf ( y).C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–315Definition 2.2. Given a lattice (cid:9)L, (cid:2)(cid:10), a function f on L is called a capacity if it satisfies the following three conditions:f (⊥) = 0;f ((cid:11)) = 1;1.2.3. x (cid:2) y implies f (x) (cid:2) f ( y).A function bel : L → [0, 1] is called a belief function if bel((cid:11)) = 1, bel(⊥) = 0 and its Möbius transform m is nonnegative. mis also called the mass function or mass assignment of f . For each element a ∈ L, the quantity m(a) is intended to measurethe belief that one commits exactly to a, not the total belief that one commits to a. To obtain the measure of the total beliefcommitted to a, one must add to m(a) the quantities m(b) for all elements that are strictly smaller than a:bel(a) =(cid:6)m(b).b(cid:2)aAn element a ∈ L is called a focal element of L if m(a) > 0. The co-Möbius transform q : L → [0, 1] of bel is called thecommonality function associated to bel.Note that any belief function is a monotonic function by nonnegativity of m, and hence a capacity.(cid:5)Example 2.3. In the above definition, if L is a Boolean algebra, then bel on L is defined in the same way as in the Dempster–Shafer theory [52]. Let Ω be a finite space. In this case, a function m : 2Ω → [0, 1] is a mass allocation function if m(∅) = 0A⊆Ω m( A) = 1. A belief function on Ω is a function bel : 2Ω → [0, 1] generated by a mass allocation function asandfollows:Note that bel(∅) = 0 and bel(Ω) = 1. The Möbius function μ : 2Ω × 2Ω → [0, 1] ism is the Möbius transform of bel and is expressed as the following formula:bel( A) :=m(B),A ⊆ Ω.μ( A, B) =(−1)|B\ A|0if A ⊆ B,otherwise.m( A) =(−1)| A\B|bel(B).(cid:6)B⊆ A(cid:7)(cid:6)B⊆ A(cid:6)B∩ A(cid:3)=∅And the associated plausibility function pl is defined aspl( A) =m(B) = 1 − bel(Ω \ A),A ⊆ Ω.(cid:8) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:3)xi(cid:6)(−1)| J |+1 f1(cid:2)i(cid:2)kJ ⊆K , J (cid:3)=∅(cid:8) (cid:11)(cid:10)x j.j∈ J(cid:8) (cid:9)(cid:10)=xi(cid:6)(−1)| J |+1 f1(cid:2)i(cid:2)kJ ⊆K , J (cid:3)=∅(cid:8) (cid:11)(cid:10)x j.j∈ JffA capacity is totally monotone if it is k-monotone for every k (cid:3) 2. A k-monotone function fabove inequality degenerates into the following equality:Definition 2.4. Let K denote the set {1, 2, . . . , k}.

If L is distributive, then the following equality is sufficient for an ∞-valuation f :f (a ∧ b) + f (a ∨ b) = f (a) + f (b)for all a, b ∈ L.(5)6C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31Proof. We prove by induction on the number of disjuncts.• Base case: k = 1, 2. The equality (4) for ∞-valuation follows immediately from (5).• Induction case: Assume that the equality (4) holds for k = n. Now we need to show that it holds for k = n + 1.(cid:8) (cid:9)f(cid:8) (cid:9)(cid:10)xi= f1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n+1= f(cid:10)xi ∨ xn+1(cid:10)xi+ f (xn+1) − f1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n(cid:8) (cid:9)1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n(cid:6)(cid:10)(xn+1 ∧ xi)(cid:13)(cid:12)according to (5)(cid:8) (cid:9)1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n(cid:10)==(−1)| J |+1 f∅(cid:3)= J ⊆{1,...,n}(cid:6)(−1)| J |+1 f∅(cid:3)= J ⊆{1,...,n}(cid:8)(cid:11)j∈ J(cid:8)(cid:11)j∈ Jx j+ f (xn+1) − f(cid:10)x j+ f (xn+1) −(cid:8) (cid:9)1(cid:2)k(cid:2)n(cid:6)(cid:10)(xn+1 ∧ xi)(cid:8)(−1)| J |+1 fxn+1 ∧∅(cid:3)= J ⊆{1,...,n}(cid:10)(cid:11)j∈ Jx j= f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) + f (xn+1)(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:14) (cid:6)+(−1)| J |+1 f(cid:10)+(cid:6)x jJ ⊆{1,...,n}| J |(cid:3)2(cid:6)=(−1)| J |+1 f∅(cid:3)= J ⊆{1,...,n,n+1}j∈ J(cid:8)(cid:11)j∈ J(cid:10)x j.n+1∈ J ⊆{1,...,n+1}| J |(cid:3)2(−1)| J |+1 f(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:15)x jj∈ JNote that both the third and fourth equalities follow from the Induction Hypothesis.So we have finished the proof that the equality (4) holds. (cid:2)Before we show Theorem 2.8, we need a lemma, which is obvious in measure theory and follows directly from the abovelemma. Define a function μ : P( X) → R on the power set P( X) of an arbitrary finite set X to be additive if μ(∅) = 0, andμ( A) + μ(B) = μ( A ∩ B) + μ( A ∪ B).Lemma 2.6.

The lemma follows from Lemma 2.5 and the fact that P( X) with the usual set operations is a Boolean algebra andhence is a distributive lattice. This is also well-known as the principle of inclusion and exclusion in probability theory (formula(2.9) on page 24 in [8]). (cid:2)The following proposition [4] tells us that every belief function is totally monotone.Proposition 2.7. Let f : L → [0, 1] be a capacity and m be its Möbius transform. If f is a belief function, then it is totally monotone.Shafer proved that the converse is also true for any belief function on Boolean algebras (Theorem 2.1 in [52]). We showthat actually it holds generally for any lattice, which answers an open question raised in [26].Theorem 2.8. Let L be a lattice and f : L → [0, 1] be a capacity on L and m be its Möbius transform. The following two statements areequivalent:• m is nonnegative;• f is totally monotone.The essential part of the following proof is based on a structurally inductive construction of the Möbius transform mfrom f : m(a) = f (a) −(cid:5)b<a m(b).C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–317Proof. Here we only need to show that, ifis totally monotone, then its Möbius transform m is nonnegative, since theother direction is simply Proposition 2.7. That is to say, any totally monotone capacity on a lattice is a belief function. Givena totally monotone capacity f on L, we are computing inductively m : L → R as follows:f• For the minimal element ⊥, m(⊥) = 0;• For any non-minimal element a ∈ L,m(a) = f (a) −(cid:6)m(b).b<aNote that the range of m is R. It is easy to see that, for such defined m, f (a) =the following claim:(cid:5)b(cid:2)a m(b) for all a ∈ L. It remains to showClaim 1. m(a) (cid:3) 0 for all a ∈ L.It is easy to see that, when a is the minimal element, m(a) (cid:3) 0. Now assume that a is a non-minimal element. We needto show that m(a) (cid:3) 0. Let A := {x: x ∈ L, x < a}. For each b < a, Ib denotes the set {x: x ∈ L, x (cid:2) b}. It is easy see that(cid:20)A =(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:21)x∈((cid:8) (cid:6)b∈ J Ib)m(x)(Lemma 2.6)(cid:10)b<a Ib.

Moreover, since fis a totally monotonic capacity,(cid:5)x∈ X m(x) for all X ⊆ L. In otherNote that the second inequality comes from the total monotonicity of f . It follows thatm(a) = f (a) −m(b) (cid:3) 0.(cid:2)(cid:6)b∈{x∈L: x<a}So any probability function is also a belief function. From Proposition A.1 in Appendix A, we know that a belief functioncan be defined on any lattice while probability functions can live only on distributive lattices. In Example 2 in [27], Grabischconstructed a “counterexample” to show that Theorem 2.8 does not hold. But, his counterexample does not work because6-monotonicity there is equivalent to 1 (cid:3) 6β − 6α not to 1 (cid:3) 6β − 9α as provided by Grabisch.Example 2.9. Here we adapt an example of belief functions on set-valued variables [13] from [12] to illustrate the theory inthis section. Let Θ = {a, b, c, d} be the set of possible faults of a given system. For any A, B ⊆ Θ , [ A, B] denotes the interval{C ⊆ Θ: A ⊆ C ⊆ B}. The interval means that the faults in B may be present but those in A are definitely present in thesystem. Let Ω be the set of all these intervals in Θ . Ω is a lattice associated with the following two operations: for anytwo [ A1, A2], [B1, B2] ∈ Ω ,(cid:7)[ A1, A2] ∧ [B1, B2] =[ A1 ∪ B1, A2 ∪ B2]∅Ωif A1 ∪ B1 ⊆ A2 ∩ B2,otherwise.8andC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31[ A1, A2] ∨ [B1, B2] = [ A1 ∩ B1, A2 ∪ B2]where ∅Ω is the empty set of Ω while ∅Θ denotes the empty set of Θ .From different pieces of evidence, we may derive the representation of degrees of beliefs in different events as thefollowing mass assignment:(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:25){a, c}, {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:13){a, c}, {a, c}(cid:26)(cid:13)= 0.56,= 0.14,mmm(cid:12)(cid:25)m(cid:12)(cid:25){c}, {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:13){d}, {a, c, d}(cid:26)(cid:13)= 0.24,= 0.06.It is easy to check that (cid:9)Ω, ∧, ∨(cid:10) is a lattice but not distributive and even the focal elements don’t satisfy the law ofdistributivity. For example,(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:25){a, c}, {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:13)∨(cid:3)=(cid:12)(cid:25){c}, {a, b, c}{a, c}, {a, b, c}∧(cid:26){d}, {a, c, d}(cid:25)∨{c}, {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:13)∧(cid:12)(cid:25){a, c}, {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:25)∨{d}, {a, c, d}(cid:26)(cid:13).From the above mass assignment, we may derive the degree of belief in the proposition that fault d is not present:(cid:12)(cid:25)bel∅Θ , {d}(cid:26)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:25)= bel∅Θ , {a, b, c}(cid:26)(cid:13)= 0.56 + 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.94.3. Belief functions on distributive latticesIn this section, we study belief functions on distributive lattice from two perspectives. The first one treats mass functionson distributive lattices as the Möbius transforms of their corresponding belief functions, and characterizes belief functionswithout reference to mass assignments. A more general result is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between belieffunctions on a distributive lattice L and those on its generated Boolean algebra, which is the smallest Boolean algebraof which L is a sublattice. We rely on the techniques from Birkhoff’s representation theorem for finite distributive lattices(Theorem A.2 in Appendix A). The second one regards belief functions as generalized probability functions. More specifically,we investigate the condition when a belief function is Bayesian or a probability function and the perspective from whichbelief functions can be regarded as inner probability functions. So, in the general setting of distributive lattices, a key part ofthe theory of belief functions is firmly rooted in probability theory. The immediate payoff to this view is a logic of reasoningabout belief functions, which will be provided in Section 5.3.1. Möbius transforms of belief functionsGiven a poset P ,J (P ) denotes the lattice of order ideals of P with the ordinary union and intersection (as subsets ofP ). So J (P ) is distributive. Conversely, from Theorem A.2 (Birkhoff’s fundamental theorem for finite distributive lattices)in Appendix A, we know that for any finite distributive lattice L, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) finite poset P forwhich L ∼= J (P ). Usually P is chosen to be the poset of join-irreducibles in L. Note that all valid propositions for J (P ) aredually valid for F (P ), which denotes the lattice of filters of P with the ordinary union and intersection. If we replace in thissection all posets (cid:9)P , (cid:2)(cid:10) by its dual (cid:9)P , (cid:2)∂ (cid:10) (where x (cid:2)∂ y iff y (cid:2) x) and all (cid:2)-order ideals by (cid:2)∂ filters, the dual forms ofthese propositions remain valid.The following two propositions provide formulas for Möbius functions and Möbius transforms in distributive lattices.Proposition 3.1. (See Example 3.9.6 in [61].) The Möbius function of the distributive lattice L = J (P ) where P is a poset is: for anyI, I(cid:4) ∈ J (P ),(cid:12)μI, I(cid:7)(cid:13)(cid:4)=(cid:4)\I|(−1)|I0(cid:4)] is a Boolean algebra,if [I, Iotherwise,where [I, I(cid:4)] denotes the interval {K ∈ J (P ): I ⊆ K ⊆ I(cid:4)}.From this proposition, we immediately obtain a nice formula for Möbius transforms.Theorem 3.2. Let L = J (P ) be a distributive lattice for some poset P . Suppose Bel : L → [0, 1] is the belief function given by the massassignment m : L → [0, 1]. Then(cid:6)m( A) =(−1)| A\B|Bel(B)[B, A] is aBoolean algebrafor all A ∈ J (P ).C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–319In order to compare the following proposition to Theorem 2.1 in [52], we prove the following proposition from theabove two theorems about Möbius transforms along the same line as Shafer’s proof of Theorem 2.1 in [52]. The relationshipto Shafer’s original proof on Boolean algebras can be made through the following fact (Section 3.4. in [61]): for any twoelements I, I(cid:4) ∈ J (P ) for some poset P , [I, I(cid:4)] is a Boolean algebra iff I(cid:4) \ I is an antichain.The following theorem is also the distributive version of Theorem 2.8.Theorem 3.3. Given a distributive lattice L = J (P ), a monotonic function Bel : L → [0, 1] is a belief function iff it satisfies the followingconditions:1. Bel(⊥) = 0;2. Bel((cid:11)) = 1;3. For every positive number n and every collection A1, . . . , An of elements of L,Bel( A1 ∪ · · · ∪ An) (cid:3)(cid:6)I⊆{1,...,n},I(cid:3)=∅(−1)|I|+1Bel(cid:8) (cid:19)(cid:10)Ai.i∈IProof. The left-to-right direction is simply Proposition 2.7. Now we mainly focus on the right-to-left direction. Assume thatBel satisfies the above three conditions and, for any A ∈ L, Bel( A) =B⊆ A m(B). According to Theorem 3.2, we know itsMöbius transform:(cid:5)(cid:6)m( A) =(−1)| A\B|Bel(B).[B, A] is aBoolean algebraIn order to show that Bel is a belief function, it suffices to show that m( A) (cid:3) 0 for all A ∈ L = J (P ). Give an elementA ∈ J (P ), define Amax to be the set of maximal elements of A in P . It is easy to see that• A \ Amax is an order ideal in P and hence is an element of J (P ) and• Amax is an antichain in P .Moreover, Amax is the maximal subset B of A such that• A \ B is an order ideal in P and hence is an element of J (P ) and• B is an antichain in P .That is to say, if B is an order ideal in P and A \ B is an antichain in P , then A \ B ⊆ Amax. Suppose that Amax = {θ1, . . . , θn}.If n = 1 and Amax = {amax}, then(cid:6)m( A) =(−1)| A\B|Bel(B)[B, A] is aBoolean algebra= Bel( A) +(cid:6)(−1)| A\B|Bel(B)A\B⊆ AmaxA\B(cid:3)=∅(cid:12)(cid:13)A \ {amax}= Bel( A) − Bel(cid:3) 0.The second equality comes from the fact immediately before this theorem and the last inequality follows from the mono-}, thentonicity. Without loss of generality, we assume that n (cid:3) 2. Let K = {1, 2, . . . , n} and Ai = A \ {θi}. If A \ B = {θi1 . . . . , θik∩ · · · ∩ Aik . It is easy to see that, for any two different Ai ’s, their union is equal to A. It follows from Theorem 3.2B = Ai1thatm( A) = Bel( A) −(−1)|I|+1Bel(cid:6)I⊆K ,I(cid:3)=∅(cid:3) 0.(cid:8) (cid:19)(cid:10)Aii∈ISimilarly the equality follows from the fact that [B, A] is a Boolean algebra iff A \ B is an antichain. And the last inequalityfollows from the third condition of total monotonicity in the assumption. (cid:2)10C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31This theorem gives another characterization of belief functions on distributive lattices without reference to mass func-tions. So it plays an important role in our axiomatization of reasoning about belief functions. If L is Boolean, then theformulas in Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 are the same as those corresponding formulas in Example 2.3.3.2. Belief functions on distributive lattices and Boolean algebrasIn this subsection, we discuss some direct connections between belief functions on distributive lattices to those onBoolean algebras. Given a distributive lattice L = J (P ) for some poset P , we know that L as a lattice is a sublattice of thepowerset of P with the usual set operations, which is a Boolean algebra. So, for any distributive lattice L, the set of Booleanalgebras of which L is a sublattice is not empty, i.e., {B: L is a sublattice of B and B is a Boolean algebra} (cid:3)= ∅. Also theintersection of any finite number of Boolean algebras is a Boolean algebra.Definition 3.4. A Boolean algebra B L is generated by the distributive lattice L if B L =Boolean algebra}.(cid:21){B: L is a sublattice of B and B is aIf L = J (P ) is a distributive lattice for some poset P , then the Boolean algebra B L generated by L is the powerset of Pwith the usual set operations (Theorem 2.1. in [41]). A more general result than this lemma but in a different form followsfrom Theorem 1 in [45]. For any two Boolean algebras B1 and B2, B1 (cid:4) B2 iff |B1| (cid:2) |B2|. So, for any distributive lattice L,the generated Boolean algebra B L is the smallest Boolean algebra into which L can be embedded.Lemma 3.5. Let L be a finite distributive lattice and B L be the Boolean algebra generated by L. If μ is a probability function on L, thenμ has a unique extension of probability function on B L . Conversely, if μ is a probability function on B L , then the restriction of μ into Lis also a probability function on L.Proof. Since the second part is clear, we focus on the first one. Assume that L = J (P ) for some poset P and μ is aprobability function on L. According to the above discussion, we know that 2P with the usual set operations is the Booleanalgebra generated by J (P ). In order to extend the probability function on L = J (P ) to 2P , it suffices to know probabilitieson singletons. For any x ∈ P , define ¯μ({x}) := μ((x]) − μ((x] \ {x}) where (x] := { y ∈ L: y (cid:2) x}. Note that the last twoprobabilities are well-defined because both (x] and (x] \ {x} are elements of J (P ). Probabilities of all other subsets of P canbe obtained easily from the additivity property. Since the extended probability function ¯μ on B L totally depends on thefunction μ on L, this extension is unique. (cid:2)In the following, we use ¯μ to denote this unique extension on B L for any probability function μ on L. So there isa one-to-one correspondence between probability functions on a distributive lattice and those on its generated Booleanalgebra. Surprisingly, this property is also shared by belief functions.Lemma 3.6. Let L be a finite distributive lattice and B L be the Boolean algebra generated by L. For any belief function Bel on B L , therestriction Bel (cid:5)L of Bel to L is a belief function on L.Proof. The proof follows from Theorem 3.3. It is easy to check that Bel (cid:5)L satisfies the following properties:1. Bel (cid:5)L (⊥) = 0;2. Bel (cid:5)L ((cid:11)) = 1;3. For every positive number n and every collection x1, . . . , xn of elements of L,Bel (cid:5)L (x1 ∨ · · · ∨ xn) (cid:3)(cid:6)(−1)|I|+1Bel (cid:5)L∅(cid:3)=I⊆{1,...,n}(cid:8) (cid:11)(cid:10)xi.i∈IThese properties are inherited from the generated Boolean algebra B L . (cid:2)Lemma 3.7. Let L be a finite distributive lattice and B L be the Boolean algebra generated by L. Any belief function Bel on L can be∗extended to a belief function Bel∗on B L in the sense that, for any x ∈ L, Bel(x) = Bel(x).Proof. Here we will appeal to the fundamental theorem for belief functions on distributive lattices Theorem 3.3. For a belieffunction Bel on L, there is a mass assignment m on L such that, for any x ∈ L, m(x) (cid:3) 0 and Bel(x) =y(cid:2)x m( y). Now wedefine a mass assignment mon B L which is an extension of m on L. Define(cid:5)∗(cid:7)∗m(x) =m(x)0if x ∈ L,if x /∈ L.C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3111Fig. 1. Hasse diagram of P 0.According to Theorem 3.3, there is a belief function BelL in the sense that, for any element x ∈ L, Bel(x) = Bel∗on B L : Bel∗∗(x). (cid:2)(cid:5)(x) :=y(cid:2)x m∗( y) which is an extension of Bel onHowever, the extension of belief functions on distributive lattice to their generated Boolean algebras are generally notunique. Consider a simple poset P 0 = (cid:9){x1, x2}, {(x1, x1), (x2, x2), (x1, x2)}(cid:10). The Hasse diagram of this poset is illustrated inFig. 1.Now we define a belief function Bel on L0 := J (P 0) as follows: m({x1}) = 12Bel({x1, x2}) = 1. In addition to the type of extension Belthe generated Boolean algebra B L0 with the following mass assignment m∗2 , and(cid:4)in Lemma 3.7, there is at least another different extension Belon(cid:4)({x1, x2}) = 12 , m4 .(cid:4)({x1}) = 1in Lemma 3.7 is unique from the perspective viewing belief functions as lower= m({x1, x2}). So Bel({x1}) = 1(cid:4)({x2}) = 14 , m: m(cid:4)∗But, in the following, we show that Belenvelopes. For any belief function Bel on a distributive lattice L, we definePBel = {μ: μ is a probability function on L and μ (cid:3) Bel}where μ (cid:3) Bel means that, for all x ∈ L, μ(x) (cid:3) Bel(x).Lemma 3.8. For any x ∈ L, Bel(x) = inf{μ(x): μ ∈ PBel}.Proof. It suffices to show that, for each x ∈ L, there is a probability function μ ∈ PBel such that μ(x) = Bel(x). But thisfollows directly from Lemmas 3.5 and 3.7 and Dempster’s similar result on Boolean algebras [10]. Given x ∈ L and a belief∗on B L . According to Dempster’s result on Booleanfunction Bel on L, we consider x as an element in B L and Bel as Bel∗algebras [10], we know that there is a probability function μ(cid:4) ∈ P∗ (i.e., for every element a ∈ B L , μ(cid:4)(a) (cid:3) Bel(a)) suchthat μ(cid:4)(x) = Bel∗(x). It follows that μ(cid:4) (cid:5)L (x) = Bel(x). (cid:2)BelRecall that∗¯μ denotes the unique extension of a probability function μ on L to B L (Lemma 3.5). The extension Beldefined in Lemma 3.7 is unique in the following sense.∗Theorem 3.9. For any x ∈ B L , Bel(x) = inf{ ¯μ(x): μ ∈ PBel}.Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that L = J (P ) and B L = 2P for some poset P . From the above lemma, we∗( A) = inf{ ¯μ( A): μ ∈ PBel}. It suffices to show the following claim:know that, for any A ∈ L, BelClaim 2. For any A ∈ B L \ L, there is a probability function μ ∈ PBel such that ¯μ( A) = Bel∗( A).(cid:20)(cid:21)Denote A∗ =∗ ∈ J (P ), A∗ (cid:2)and hence A− (cid:3)= ∅. It follows from Lemma 3.8 that there is a probability function μ ∈ PBel on J (P ) such that∗ \ A. Note that A∗ ∈ J (P ), AI ⊇ A} and A− = A{I ∈ J (P ):{I ∈ J (P ):I ⊆ A}, A∗ =∗∗( A)(= μ( A∗)), then we are done. If ¯μ( A) > Bel∗( A)(= ¯μ( A∗) = μ( A∗)), then we need to construct a newprobability function μ A such that μ A (cid:5)L∈ PBel and μ A( A) = μ( A∗) in order to prove the claim. Recall that, for each a ∈ P ,(a] denotes the set {b ∈ P : b (cid:2) a}. For each a ∈ A \ A∗, (a] ∩ A− (cid:3)= ∅. For, otherwise, since (a] ⊆ A, A∗ (cid:2) (a] ∪ A∗ ⊆ A, whichcontradicts the fact that A∗ is the largest element in L that is a subset of A. Let f A denote a function from A \ A∗ to A−such that, for each a ∈ A \ A∗, f A(a) ∈ (a] ∩ A−.Now we transpose the mass of ¯μ at each a ∈ A \ A∗ to f A(a) in (a] ∩ A−. We define a new probability function μ A on∗B L with the mass assignment as follows: for any a ∈ P ,A (cid:2) A∗( A) = Bel( A∗) = μ( A∗).BelIf ¯μ( A) = Bel(cid:13)(cid:12){a}=μ A⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩¯μ({a})0¯μ({a}) +(cid:5)¯μ({a})¯μ({b})f A (b)=ab∈ A\ A∗∗),if a ∈ A∗ ∪ (P \ Aif a ∈ A \ A∗,if A− (cid:20) a = f A(b) for some b ∈ A \ A∗,otherwise.The transposition defined in μ A can be illustrated in Fig. 2.12C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31Fig. 2. The transposition defined in μ A .Fig. 3. Hasse diagram of a distributive lattice L0 as a counterexample.(cid:5)It is easy to see thata∈P μ A({a}) = 1 and hence it defines a probability function on B L , which is still denoted as μ A .∗( A) and the only elements in P where the masses of μ A may be smaller than those of ¯μNote that μ A( A) = ¯μ( A∗) = Belare those elements in A \ A∗. In order to show that μ A is the probability function that we want, we only need to showthat, for all I ∈ J (P ), μ A(I) (cid:3) Bel(I). For every I ∈ J (P ), if a ∈ I and a ∈ A \ A∗, then f A(a) ∈ (a] ⊆ I . So(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:13)μ A{a}+ μ A(cid:12)(cid:28)f A(a)(cid:29)(cid:13)(cid:13)=(cid:12)(cid:12)¯μ(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:28){a}+ ¯μ(cid:29)(cid:13)(cid:13).f A(a)a∈I,a∈ A\ A∗a∈I,a∈ A\ A∗This equality implies that, for each I ∈ J (P ), μ A(I) (cid:3) ¯μ(I). Since μ ∈ PBel and ¯μ is the extension of μ, μ A(I) (cid:3) Bel(I).So we have shown that μ A( A) = Bel∗( A) and μ A (cid:5)L∈ PBel. (cid:2)3.3. Bayesian belief functionsIn this part, we investigate Bayesian belief functions and the condition in the setting of distributive lattices when a belieffunction is Bayesian. Shafer showed that a belief function on a Boolean algebra is Bayesian if and only if all of its focalelements are singletons (Theorem 2.8 in [52]). We have a similar property for distributive lattices. This property can besummarized in a simple comparison: join-irreducibles to distributive lattices are the same as singletons to Boolean algebras.Definition 3.10. Given a distributive lattice L = (cid:9)L, (cid:2)(cid:10), a belief function Bel : L → [0, 1] is called Bayesian if,Bel(a ∨ b) + Bel(a ∧ b) = Bel(a) + Bel(b) whenever a, b ∈ L.(7)From Lemma 2.5, for any distributive lattice L = (cid:9)L, (cid:2)(cid:10), a belief function Bel : L → [0, 1] is Bayesian if and only if it is aprobability function.Remark 3.11. The condition (7) can’t be replaced with another simpler but weaker additivity condition:Bel(a ∨ b) = Bel(a) + Bel(b) whenever a, b ∈ L such that a ∧ b = ⊥.(8)The counterexample is illustrated in Fig. 3.It is easy to see that the above lattice L0 is a distributive lattice. Define a function Bel : L0 → [0, 1] as follows:C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3113Bel(⊥) = 0,Bel(a ∧ b) = 15The condition (8) hold vacuously for the above defined Bel. However, Bel(a ∨ b) + Bel(a ∧ b) (cid:3)= Bel(a) + Bel(b). This impliesthat the condition (7) does not hold for Bel.Bel(a ∨ b) = 45Bel(a) = 25Bel((cid:11)) = 1.= Bel(b),,,Definition 3.12. Let Bel be a belief function on a distributive lattice L with the set I L of join-irreducibles in L. The inner◦belief function Belof Bel is defined as follows:(cid:6)◦(a) =Belm(x).x∈I L , x(cid:2)a◦In other words, Bel◦(a) (cid:2) Bel(a).Bel(a) is the sum of all mass assignments on join-irreducibles which are less than or equal to a. SoLemma 3.13. Let Bel be a belief function on a distributive lattice L with the set I L of join-irreducibles in L. Then the above defined inner◦belief function Belis an ∞-valuation on L.◦Proof. Let Bel be a belief function on a distributive lattice L with the set I L of join-irreducibles in L and Belcorresponding inner belief function. For any elements a1, . . . , an ∈ L,be the◦Bel(a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an) =(cid:6)m(x)(cid:30)x is join-irreduciblex(cid:2)i∈{1,...,n} ai(cid:6)m(x)x is join-irreduciblex(cid:2)ai at least for some i (1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n)(cid:6)(−1)|I|+1∅(cid:3)=I⊆{1,...,n}(cid:14) (cid:6)(cid:6)(−1)|I|+1Bel◦∅(cid:3)=I⊆{1,...,n}x is join-irreducible(cid:22)x(cid:2)(cid:8) (cid:11)i∈I ai(cid:10)ai.i∈I===(cid:15)m(x)The second equality follows from the fact that, for elements x, x1, . . . , xn in a distributive lattice, if x (cid:2)1(cid:2)i(cid:2)n xi andx is join-irreducible, then x (cid:2) xi at least for some xi (1 (cid:2) i (cid:2) n). And the third one comes from Lemma 2.6 if we de-x∈ X m(x) for all X ⊆ L. For example, μ({x ∈ L: x is join-irreducible and x (cid:2) ai}) =fine an additive set function μ( X) :=(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:30)m(x).x is join-irreduciblex(cid:2)ai◦So indeed Belis an ∞-valuation on L. (cid:2)◦Note that Bel◦is not necessarily a probability function on L because Bel((cid:11)) may not be equal to 1. The followingtheorem is a partial converse to this lemma and is also the distributive counterpart of Lemma 2.7 in [52].Theorem 3.14. A belief function Bel on a distributive lattice L = J (P ) where P is a poset is Bayesian iff its corresponding massin J (P ) and m( A) = 0 for all join-reducibles A ∈ J (P ).assignment m is given by m( A(cid:4)) for any minimal join-irreducibles A(cid:4)) = Bel( A(cid:4)Proof. Let Bel be a belief function on a distributive lattice L = J (P ) where P is a poset and m be its corresponding massassignment. First note that1. I ∈ J (P ) is join-irreducible in the lattice J (P ) iff I is a principal order ideal in P ;2. Minimal join-irreducible elements are atoms, hence singletons. And A(cid:4)is a minimal join-irreducible in J (P ) iff A(cid:4) = {θ}for some minimal element θ ∈ P .Assume that Bel is also a probability function on J (P ).Claim 3. For any minimal element θ ∈ P , Bel({θ}) = m({θ}).14C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31It follows directly from the fact that, for any minimal element θ ∈ P , {θ} is a singleton principal order ideal of P , i.e.,{θ} ∈ J (P ) that Bel({θ}) = m({θ}). Next we showClaim 4. m( A) = 0 for all join-reducibles A in L, which are non-principal order ideals of P .We prove this by induction on the rank of A, which is actually the number | A| of elements in A (according to Theo-rem A.4 in Appendix A). Note that the lowest rank of a join-reducible element in L is 2.• Base case: rank( A) = 2 and A is a non-principal order ideal of P . It follows that A = {a1, a2} for some two distinctminimal elements a1 and a2 in P . Since Bel is a probability function, Bel({a1, a2}) = Bel({a1}) + Bel({a2}). On the otherhand, since Bel is a belief function, Bel({a1, a2}) = m({a1, a2}) + m({a1}) + m({a2}). From the above Claim 3, it followsthat m({a1, a2}) = 0.• Induction case: Suppose that m( Aof rank (cid:2) k. Given a non-principal or-der ideal A of rank k + 1, we need to show that m( A) = 0. First note that, for any order ideal B (not necessarilynon-principal) of rank (cid:2) k,(cid:4)) = 0 for all non-principal order ideals A(cid:4)Bel(B) =(cid:6)m(C)C⊆B,C∈ J (P )(cid:6)=C⊆B, C∈ J (P )C is join-irreducible◦= Bel(B).m(C)(from the induction assumption)(9)Since A is a non-principal order ideal in P , it must be a union of some different principal order ideals (a1], . . . , (an] forsome a1, . . . , an ∈ P where n (cid:3) 2 and (ai] = {x ∈ L: x (cid:2) ai}(1 (cid:2) i (cid:2) n).Bel( A) = m( A) += m( A) += m( A) += m( A) +(cid:6)m(B)B(cid:2) A,B∈ J (P )(cid:6)B(cid:2) AB is a principal order ideal(cid:6)B⊆ AB is a principal order ideal(cid:6)m(B)(Induction hypothesis)m(B)( A is non-principal)m(B)(Note at the beginning of the proof)B⊆ AB is join-irreducible in J (P )◦= m( A) + Bel(Definition 3.12)( A)(cid:6)= m( A) += m( A) +∅(cid:3)=I⊆{1,...,n}(cid:6)(−1)◦|I|+1Bel(Lemma 3.13)(cid:8) (cid:19)(cid:10)(ai]i∈I(cid:8) (cid:19)(cid:10) (cid:8)(−1)|I|+1Bel(ai]∅(cid:3)=I⊆{1,...,n}i∈I(cid:8)(cid:19)(cid:10)(cid:10)(ai](cid:2) k(9) and ranki∈I= m( A) + Bel( A)(the assumption that Bel is a probability function).It follows that m( A) = 0. So we have finished the induction case and hence the claim.By summarizing the above inductive proof, we prove the left-to-right direction. Now we go for the other direction.Assume that the mass assignment m that corresponds to Bel is given by m({θ}) = Bel({θ}) for any minimal elements θ in(cid:4)).P and m( A) = 0 for all non-principal order ideals A ∈ J (P ). It immediately follows that, for any ASo indeed Bel is an ∞-valuation and hence a probability function on J (P ). (cid:2)(cid:4) ∈ J (P ), Bel( A(cid:4)) = Bel◦( ACorollary 3.15. A belief function Bel on a distributive lattice is Bayesian (or a probability function) iff all its focal elements are join-irreducibles.So a Bayesian belief function (or probability function) μ on a distributive lattice L = J (P ) for some poset P is more likea point function than a set function in its level of complexity in the sense that μ is determined by its values at elements ofC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3115P (which correspond to principal order ideals in P ) rather by its values at all order ideals of P (all values at non-principalorder ideals are 0). This implies that generally probability functions are simpler and easier to describe than belief functions.The Bayesian theory adopts a rule of conditioning for updating beliefs, which is a special case of Dempster’s rule ofcombination in the Dempster–Shafer theory. Since this rule is related to another view of belief functions as evidence, wechoose to leave it for another occasion.3.4. Belief functions as inner probability functionsWe have provided the condition when a belief function is Bayesian. In the remainder of this section, we explore oneperspective from which a belief function is regarded as a generalized probability function in the sense that a belief functioncan be regarded as an inner probability function of a certain structure. The significance of this perspective is that thesatisfiability problem of a given belief formula with respect to the class of belief-function structures is equivalent to thatwith respect to the class of probability-function structures. So we can translate the complexity of satisfiability problem withrespect to the class of belief-function structures into that of satisfiability problem with respect to the class of probabilitystructures, which follows directly from the well-known result in [18] with respect to the class of Boolean algebras as well asthe representation theorem for distributive lattices (Theorem A.2 in Appendix A). In Section 5, we show that the complexityof deciding whether a belief formula is satisfiable with respect to the class of belief-function structures on distributivelattices (especially on those structures for many non-classical logics) is NP-complete. Moreover, this perspective providesan alternative representation of belief functions to the well-known one by Shafer through the composition of probabilityfunctions with ∩-homomorphisms [53].Unlike belief functions, probability functions in classical probability theory and measure theory [30] are usually notdefined on all events. Let’s consider a probability function P r on the structure called measurable space (cid:9)S, A(cid:10) where S is afinite sample space and A is an algebra on S and is a subclass of 2S . P r is defined on A but not on 2S . In other words,not every subset of 2S , which is called an event, is assigned a probability. Only those in A are assigned a probability andare called “measurable”. Non-measurable events are usually considered mathematically meaningless. However, the notionof non-measurability is a desirable feature in reasoning with probabilities [18]. It provides a means to model uncertaintyunder incomplete information. The example in Section 1 in [11] and Example 2.3 in [18] give a motivation for this notionin dealing with uncertainty.In order to generalize the above idea to the setting of distributive lattices, we need first to define the notion of measur-ability. Let L be a distributive lattice and Bel be a belief function on L. DefineLBel :=(cid:28)a ∈ L: Bel(a ∨ b) = Bel(a) + Bel(b) − Bel(a ∧ b) for every b ∈ L(cid:29).Every element a ∈ LBel is called Bel-measurable or simply measurable when the context is clear. This is a natural generaliza-tion of a classic approach to measure extension due to Caratheodory [8]. From Theorem 1 in[60] , the following theoremfollows immediately:Theorem 3.16. LBel is a sublattice of L and hence is distributive. Moreover, Bel (cid:5)LBel is a probability function on LBel.(cid:4)Let Ldefinebe a sublattice of L. So L(cid:4)is distributive. If μ is a probability function on L(cid:4), then, for each element x ∈ L, we can• μ∗(x) = sup{μ( y): y ∈ L• μ∗(x) = inf{μ( y): y ∈ L(cid:4), y (cid:2) x};(cid:4), y (cid:3) x}.(cid:4)The above defined two functions μ∗ and μ∗on L are called inner and outer probability functions on L respectively. Note. The probability function μ assigns a precise probability to each element in theand is not well-defined at other elements in L. So it is actually a partial function on L. In contrast, both μ∗which are induced by μ, are total on L. Intuitively, for each element a ∈ L, μ∗(a) is the probability of the biggestwhich is greatergive the best bounds onthat they depend on the choice of Lsublattice Land μ∗element in Lthan or equal to a. In other words, given the probability function on the sublattice Lthe “true” probability at each element a ∈ L.which is less than or equal to a; dually, μ∗(a) is the probability of the smallest element in L, μ∗ and μ∗(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)The following proposition reveals a relation of inner probability functions to belief functions.Lemma 3.17. The above defined μ∗ is a belief function on L.Proof. Let L be a distributive lattice, Lassignment mL(cid:4) that corresponds to μ such that, for any element a ∈ Lassignment mL on L as follows:(cid:7)if x ∈ Lotherwise.mL(cid:4) (x)0mL(x) =(cid:4),(cid:4)be a sublattice and μ be a probability function on L(cid:4)(cid:4), μ(a) =(cid:5). It follows that there is a massb(cid:2)a,b∈L(cid:4) mL(cid:4) (b). Now we define a mass16C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31It is easy to see that mL(a) (cid:3) 0 for all a ∈ L. In other words, mL is an extension of mL(cid:4) to L.Claim 5. For the above defined μ∗, μ∗(a) =(cid:5)b∈L(cid:4),b(cid:2)a mL(b) for all a ∈ L.For any a ∈ L, let aL(cid:4) :=y. The proof of the claim proceeds as follows:(cid:30)y(cid:2)a(cid:4)y∈Lμ∗(a) = sup(cid:28)(cid:8) (cid:9)μ( y): y ∈ L(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:29)(cid:4), y (cid:2) a= μysince aL(cid:4) ∈ L(by definition)(cid:13)(cid:4)===y(cid:2)a(cid:4)y∈L(cid:6)mL(cid:4) (x)(cid:4)x∈Lx(cid:2)aL(cid:6)(cid:4)mL(cid:4) (x)(cid:4)x∈Lx(cid:2)a(cid:6)x∈Lx(cid:2)amL(x)(mL is an extension of mL(cid:4) ).This is to say, μ∗ is a belief function on L that corresponds to the mass assignment mL . (cid:2)Corollary 3.18. If Bel is a belief function on a distributive lattice L, then Bel (cid:3) (Bel (cid:5)LBel )∗ in the sense that Bel(a) (cid:3) (Bel (cid:5)LBel )∗(a) forall a ∈ L.Lemma 3.17 says that every inner probability function is a belief function. But the converse does not quite hold. Let Belbe a belief function on the powerset of S = {s1, s2} such that Bel({s1}) = 12 and Bel({s2}) = 0. It is easy to check that Bel isnot an inner probability function. So the inequalities in the above corollary may be strict. Still we can show that any belieffunction on a distributive lattice L is equivalent to an inner probability function in some logical sense. In order to showthis equivalence, we need the following positive language which is the standard language for propositional logic withoutnegation.We start with a fixed infinite set P := {p1, p2, . . .} of propositional letters. We also use p, q, . . . to denote propositionalletters. The set of formulas ϕ is built from propositional letters as usual by connectives ∨ and ∧. Equivalently, a formula ϕis formed by the following syntax:ϕ := p | ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 | ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2where p is a propositional letter. We define Φ0 the set of formulas in this syntax. Here we also use ∧ and ∨ as connectivesin logic. The context will determine whether they are used as lattice operations or as logical connectives.Definition 3.19. A probability structure is a tuple M = (cid:9)P , L, Llattices, L = J (P ), Lv can be easily extended to a homomorphism from Φ0 to L:is a sublattice of L, μ is a probability measure on L(cid:4)(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) where P is a poset, both L and Lare distributive, and v associates each p with an element in L.(cid:4)(cid:4)1. v(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) := v(ϕ1) ∧ v(ϕ2);2. v(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) := v(ϕ1) ∨ v(ϕ2).L0 is called a basis of M if the elements in L0 are disjoint from each other and L(cid:4)elements in L0. For any formula ϕ, v(ϕ) ∈ L. Generally, it is not true that v(ϕ) ∈ L“measurable”.(cid:4)consists precisely of all finite unions of; in other words, v(ϕ) is not necessarilyDefinition 3.20. A DS structure is a tuple D = (cid:9)P , L, Bel, v(cid:10) where P is a poset, L is a distributive lattice, L = J (P ), Bel is abelief function on L and v maps each propositional letter p to an element in L. Similarly, v can be easily extended to ahomomorphism from Φ0 to L as in the above definition.We call a probability structure M = (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) and a DS structure D = (cid:9)P D , L D , Bel, v D (cid:10) equivalent iffor any formula ϕ ∈ Φ0, μ∗(cid:12)(cid:13)v(ϕ)= Bel(cid:12)(cid:13)v D (ϕ).Theorem 3.21. For any probability structure M = (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10), there is an equivalent DS-structure.C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3117Proof. This follows directly from Lemma 3.17. (cid:2)Now we prove the converse to this proposition.Theorem 3.22. For every DS structure D = (cid:9)P D , L D , Bel, v D (cid:10), there is an equivalent probability structure M = (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10).Here we simulate the proof in [18] to give a detailed proof, which can also be used to easily show the followingcorollaries.∗A∈ J (P D ) Aidentity relation. Let A(cid:20)Proof. Let D = (cid:9)P D , L D , Bel, v D (cid:10) be a DS-structure and m be the corresponding mass assignment of Bel. According to thedefinition, L D = J (P D ).The probability structure M := (cid:9)P , L, L∗ = {( A, s): s ∈ A} for any A ∈ J (P ). It is easy to see that, if A (cid:3)= B, then A: A ∈ J (P D )} to be the “basis” for the distributive lattice L∗. It is easy to see that L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) is defined as follows. Let P be the set {( A, s): s ∈ A, A ∈ J (P D )} with the∗ = ∅. In addition,is the set ofwith the usual set operations is indeed a distributive lattice andwith the set complement are Boolean∗ = P . We take { Aall finite unions of elements Ais actually a sublattice of L := (cid:9)2P , ∩, ∪(cid:10). It is interesting to note that both L and Lalgebras.in the sense that L∗) = m( A) for any A ∈ J (P D ). Then we extend μ to all of L(cid:4)by additivity. So μ is a probability function on L.Define a valuation to L as follows: v(p) = {(B, s): s ∈ v D (p) ∩ B, B ∈ J (P D )}. We can show by induction on the complexityof ϕ that, for all formulas ϕ ∈ Φ0, v(ϕ) = {(B, s): s ∈ v D (ϕ) ∩ B, B ∈ J (P D )}.Now we will show that such defined probability structure M = (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) is equivalent to the belief structure D. For∗ ⊆ v(ϕ) iff ( A, s) ∈ v(ϕ) for all s ∈ A iff s ∈ v D (ϕ) for all s ∈ A iff A ⊆ v D (ϕ). SoDefine μ( Aeach formula ϕ and A ∈ J (P D ), we have Athe largest “measurable” set (simply the largest element in L) contained in v(ϕ) is. It follows that∗ ∩ B(cid:20)∗(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)A⊆v D (ϕ) A(cid:12)(cid:13)v(ϕ)μ∗(cid:8) (cid:17)= μ(cid:10)∗A(cid:6)A⊆v D (ϕ)(cid:12)μA(cid:13)∗A⊆v D (ϕ)(cid:6)m( A)==A⊆v D (ϕ)(cid:12)(cid:13)v D (ϕ).= BelSo we have shown that M and D are equivalent. (cid:2)Corollary 3.23. For every DS-structure D = (cid:9)P D , L D , Bel, v D (cid:10) on a distributive lattice L D , there is an equivalent probability structureM = (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) such that both L and Lare Boolean algebras.(cid:4)Proof. This follows directly from the above construction of L and L(cid:4). (cid:2)These equivalence results turn out to be crucial to show the complexity of reasoning about belief functions over somenon-Boolean structures (Lemma 5.5 in Section 5). By summarizing the results in the above two theorems, we conclude thatbelief functions and inner probability functions are equivalent on distributive lattices if we view them both as functions onformulas rather on sets. Just as in [18], there is an immediate payoff to this view of belief functions as inner probabilityfunctions: a logic for reasoning about belief functions in Section 5 is obtained from that for inner probability functions [19]with minor modifications. The following proposition is simply a corollary of the above theorem, which is a partial converseto Lemma 3.17. Also it provides an alternative representation of belief functions to the well-known one by Shafer throughthe composition of probability functions with ∩-homomorphisms in [53].Corollary 3.24. Given a DS structure (cid:9)P D , L D , BelD , v D (cid:10) defined on a finite distributive lattice L D (= J (P D )), there is a probabilitystructure (cid:9)P , L, L(cid:4), μ, v(cid:10) and a surjection f : P → P D such that, for each x ∈ L D , we have Bel(x) = μ∗( f−1(x)).Proof. Here we choose L and L( A, s) ∈ P such that s ∈ A and A ∈ J (P D ).of Theorem 3.22 works here simply by replacing x for v D (ϕ) and ffin the proof of Theorem 3.22. A function f : P → P D is defined as:f (( A, s)) = s foris a surjection from P to P D . Then the argument in the last part of the proof−1(x) for v(ϕ). (cid:2)(cid:4)18C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–314. Belief functions on non-classical formalismsThe integration of belief functions and non-classical formalisms is intended to master two sources of ignorance. Non-classical formalisms usually take care of the incompleteness or inconsistency in the knowledge-base due to imperfect datawhile belief functions take care of the limitation of the information that the agent has at his disposal. In artificial intelligenceespecially in Knowledge Representation, non-classical formalisms play an important role in handling imperfect informationin different forms. Most of these non-classical formalisms assume a mathematical setting of distributive lattices (quantumlogic is probably one of the very few important exceptions [67]). Each of these formalisms was intended for reasoning aboutsome specific form of information. For example, Kleene’s three valued logic has been used to take into account statementsthat being undefined makes sense to be a third truth value, which is useful to model the situation in computer science whena computation does not return any result [23]; paraconsistent logics have been used to deal with contradictory knowledgebases [3,44]; relevance logic is used to deal with the famous logical omniscience problem in the foundation of knowledgerepresentation, and used for reasoning in the presence of inconsistency in knowledge base systems [37,38,19].(cid:4)Belief functions in the Dempster–Shafer theory are defined on Boolean algebras [52]. One essential difference of non-classical formalisms from the Boolean setting is their specific treatments of negation. Negation is closely related to thetreatment of bipolarity in information [14], which means that there is an intrinsic positive and negative effect in dealingwith information. In the classical Dempster–Shafer theory, negation is assumed to be Boolean, i.e., every element has acomplement (for any element a, there is an element ais the bottom), whichis used to represent complete information. Any distributive lattice with a Boolean negation is a Boolean algebra and anyBoolean algebra is represented as a power set with the usual set operations (Example 2.3). It is shown [18] that reasoningabout belief functions in this case is the same as that for inner probability measures [19]. In Kleene’s three valued logic,there are three truth values: true, false and undetermined. Logically, the treatment of negation considers some formulas tobe neither true nor false (undetermined) but forbids any formula to be both true and false. In other words, positive andnegative sides don’t exhaust all possibilities. So this logic is used to represent incompleteness in information. There is animplicit intuitionistic negation in any finite distributive lattice. Since any finite distributive lattice L = J (P ) for some poset P(cid:4) ∩ I = ∅} exists for any I ∈ J (P ), and is defined to be the negation of I (denotedis also a Heyting algebra, max{Iby ∼ I ), which is in J (P ). The duality relation between belief function and plausibility function in Dempster–Shafer theorycan be expressed in the following form: for any I ∈ L,is the top element and a ∧ asuch that a ∨ a(cid:4) ∈ J (P ): I(cid:4)(cid:4)1 − Bel(∼ I) = 1 − Bel(cid:12)max(cid:28)(cid:4) ∈ J (P ): II(cid:6)(cid:29)(cid:13)(cid:4) ∩ I = ∅(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:4)mI= 1 −I(cid:6)=(cid:4)∈ J (P )I(cid:4)⊆max{I(cid:4)∈ J (P ): I(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:4)mI(cid:4)∩I=∅}(cid:4)∈ J (P )I(cid:4)∩I(cid:3)=∅Iwhere Bel is a belief function on L and m is the corresponding mass assignment of Bel. So, the duality relation is essentiallyintuitionistic. One may also reason about belief functions in this case by replacing the classical proposition logic by intu-itionistic propositional logic (see discussion in Section 6). A good example in this direction is bipolar belief pairs on vaguepropositions as an integrated model combining epistemic uncertainty and indeterminacy [36].Kleene’s three-valued logic finds a natural generalization in Belnap’s four-valued logic [5], which can be naturally ex-tended to distributive bilattices. A distributive bilattice is a distributive lattice with a second ordering which interacts withthe original one in a certain way. In addition to their applications in logic programming [23], distributive bilattices are alsoused to represent the inconsistency in knowledge base systems. In these structures, another form of negation called deMorgan negation is employed. The most important aspect of de Morgan negations is their intrinsic ability to model incon-sistency in knowledge base systems. In this paper, we will consider this type of negations and integrate belief functionswith de Morgan lattices, which are distributive lattices with de Morgan negations, provide an axiomatization of reasoningabout belief functions over this type of non-classical structures and discuss computational complexities of different prob-lems in this setting. More importantly, this approach to reasoning about belief functions on de Morgan lattices also providesa framework to reason about belief functions on other non-classical structures.A well-known slogan in algebraic methods for non-classical logics (Section 18 of [1]) tells us that algebra and logic aredual to each other. Given a non-classical logic L, the Lindenbaum algebra AL of this logic is in the class of algebras whichcharacterize the logic but also the possible-world-like structure derived from the Lindenbaum algebra AL through the Dual-ity theorem for this class of algebras is the canonical structure for this logic. On the other hand, given any possible-world-likestructure for the logic L, the interpretations of the formulas is an algebra that characterizes L. So, in the following section,before we reason about belief functions on specific classes of algebras, we elaborate on this kind of duality between logicsand their corresponding algebraic structures (and possible-world-like semantics) and won’t distinguish belief functions onalgebras and for their logics.In addition to this duality, algebra and logic are dual to each other in the sense that (order) ideals to algebra are thesame as filters to logic. If we replace in Section 3 all posets (cid:9)P , (cid:2)(cid:10) with its dual (cid:9)P , (cid:2)∂ (cid:10) (where x (cid:2)∂ y iff y (cid:2) x) andC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3119all (cid:2)-order-ideals by (cid:2)∂ -filters, the dual forms of all propositions there remain valid. So, in order to apply the algebraicpropositions in Section 3 to non-classical logics in this section, we have to keep this duality in mind.4.1. Reasoning about bilatticesBilattices are algebras with two separate lattice structures. Ginsberg [25] suggested using bilattices as the underlyingframework for various AI inference systems including those based on default logics, truth maintenance systems, probabilis-tic logics, and others. These ideas were later pursued in the context of logic programming semantics [22,21]. Moreover,bilattices and their extensions have been used in the literature to model a variety of reasoning mechanisms about uncer-tainty in the presence of incomplete or contradictory information [33,3,54]. Also they have been employed to representbipolar information [34]. In the following, we first present a well-known algebraic result about the representation of bilat-tices. In logic, we employ the Belnap’s four-valued logic to decouple the interpretation of each formula ϕ into the set ofstates where ϕ is “true” and that of states where it is “false” [15]. In this way, the interpretations of all formulas form adistributive bilattices with two partial orderings: the truth ordering and the knowledge ordering.One may refer to [40,23] for the technical details about the duality theorem of bilattices which is presented below. Recallthat all lattices are assumed to be finite.Definition 4.1. A bilattice is an algebra B = (cid:9)B, ∧1, ∨1, ⊥1, (cid:11)1, ∧2, ∨2, ⊥2, (cid:11)2(cid:10) such that B1 = (cid:9)B, ∧1, ∨1, ⊥1, (cid:11)1(cid:10) and B2 =(cid:9)B, ∧2, ∨2, ⊥2, (cid:11)2(cid:10) are lattices. By a negation on B we mean a unary operation ¬ on B satisfying the conditions:1. ¬¬x = x;2. ¬(x ∨1 y) = ¬x ∧1 ¬ y, ¬(x ∧1 y) = ¬x ∨1 ¬ y;3. ¬(x ∨2 y) = ¬x ∨2 ¬ y, ¬(x ∧2 y) = ¬x ∧2 ¬ y.B is called distributive if, for every ♦, (cid:7) ∈ {∧1, ∨1, ∧2, ∨2} and all x, y, z ∈ B x♦( y(cid:7)z) = (x♦ y)(cid:7)(x♦z).The lattice ordering corresponding to the lattice B1 will be denoted by (cid:2)1 and the lattice ordering corresponding to B2by (cid:2)2; often the bilattice B is written in the form (cid:9)B, (cid:2)1, (cid:2)2(cid:10). Alternatively, (cid:2)1 and (cid:2)2 are often denoted by (cid:2)t and (cid:2)k,respectively, reflecting the fact that they represent the “truth” and “knowledge” orderings, which will become clear in thefollowing Definition 4.4 and in Remark 4.7.Definition 4.2. Let L = (cid:9)L, ∧, ∨, ⊥, (cid:11)(cid:10) and L⊥2, (cid:11)2(cid:10) as follows: for all (x, x(cid:4)), ( y, y(cid:4)) ∈ L × L(cid:4) = (cid:9)L(cid:4),(cid:4), ∧(cid:4), ∨(cid:4), ⊥(cid:4), (cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:10) be lattices. Define B(L, L(cid:4)) = (cid:9)L × L(cid:4), (cid:22)1, (cid:23)1, ⊥1, (cid:11)1, (cid:22)2, (cid:23)2,(cid:4)) (cid:22)1 ( y, y(cid:4)) (cid:22)2 ( y, y(cid:4) ∨(cid:4)• (x, x(cid:4) ∧(cid:4)• (x, x• ⊥1 = (⊥, (cid:11)(cid:4)), (cid:11)1 = ((cid:11), ⊥(cid:4)), ⊥2 = (⊥, ⊥(cid:4)), (cid:11)2 = ((cid:11), (cid:11)(cid:4)).(cid:4)) = (x ∧ y, x(cid:4)) = (x ∧ y, x(cid:4)) (cid:23)1 ( y, y(cid:4)) (cid:23)2 ( y, y(cid:4)), (x, x(cid:4)), (x, x(cid:4)) = (x ∨ y, x(cid:4)) = (x ∨ y, xyy(cid:4) ∧(cid:4)(cid:4) ∨(cid:4)(cid:4));(cid:4));yy(cid:4)) is called the product bilattice associated with L and LB(L, L(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)∼(cid:4)x, x=(cid:13), x,(cid:4)x(cid:4). If L = L(cid:4), we defineand call B(L, L) the square bilattice with negation associated with L. Usually in this case we write B(L) for B(L, L).Any abstract distributive bilattice with negation can be represented as a square bilattice with negation (Corollary 9 in[40]). Let B = (cid:9)B, (cid:2)1, (cid:2)2(cid:10) be a distributive bilattice. An element x ∈ B is called positive if, for every y ∈ B, x (cid:2)1 y impliesx (cid:2)2 y. It is called negative if, for every y ∈ B, y (cid:2)1 x implies x (cid:2)2 y. Intuitively, an element x is positive (negative) ifit should increase in the knowledge ordering whenever it increases (decreases) in the truth order. Denote by POS(B) andNEG(B) the set of positive and negative elements (they are called t-grounded and f -grounded in [25]), respectively, of B.An element x ∈ B is called positive (resp. negative) (cid:2)2-join-irreducible if it is positive (resp. negative) and join-irreduciblewith respect to (cid:2)2-ordering. We denote by (cid:24)+2 (B)) the set of non-bottom positive (resp. negative) (cid:2)2-join-irreducible elements of B. Note that both (cid:24)+2 (B) are posets with respect to the ordering (cid:2)2. Moreover, (cid:24)2(B)denotes the set of all (cid:2)2-join-irreducible elements of B. If a bilattice B is distributive and is represented as a square bi-lattice, then it is easy to recognize those positive and negative elements. Let L be a distributive lattice and let 0 be theleast element. An element x of B(L) is positive iff x = ( y, 0) for some y ∈ L, and is negative iff x = (0, y) for some y ∈ L(Corollary 8 in [40]). The positive and negative elements here correspond to the two support relations |(cid:25)T and |(cid:25)F in thefollowing four-valued models.2 (B) (resp. (cid:24)−2 (B) and (cid:24)−Let P = (cid:9)P , (cid:4)(cid:10) and Q = (cid:9)Q , (cid:26)(cid:10) be two disjoint partially ordered sets. Define the lift of P , denoted by P ⊥ by P ⊥ =(cid:9)P ∪ {0}, (cid:2)(cid:10), where 0 /∈ P and x (cid:2) y in P ⊥ iff x = 0 or x (cid:4) y in P . Define the disjoint union P (cid:27) Q = (cid:9)P ∪ Q , (cid:2)(cid:10) to be thepartially ordered set with x (cid:2) y iff either x, y ∈ P and x (cid:4) y or x, y ∈ Q and x (cid:26) y.Given two partially ordered sets P and Q , define the separated sum of P and Q , denoted P ⊕⊥ Q , to be the posetP ⊕⊥ Q = (P (cid:27) Q )⊥. The following theorem is the bilattice counterpart of Birkhoff’s representation theorem.20C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31Fig. 4. Lattice FOUR interpreted by subsets of {0, 1}.Theorem 4.3. (See Corollary 23 in [40].) Let B be a distributive bilattice with negation. Then (cid:24)2(B) ∼= (cid:24)+2 (B) ∼=2 (B). Conversely, for any finite poset P , there is a finite distributive bilattice B such that (cid:24)2(B) ∼= P ⊕⊥ P . So there is a one-to-one(cid:24)−correspondence between finite distributive bilattices and finite posets.2 (B) and (cid:24)+2 (B) ⊕⊥ (cid:24)−Intuitively, the theorem says that any distributive lattice with negation can be represented as a concrete square bilattice.Let J 2((cid:24)2(B)) denote the set of (cid:2)2-order-ideals in (cid:24)2(B). It is easy to check that it is the same as the Cartesian productof the set of order ideals in (cid:24)+J 2((cid:24)2(B)) ≈ J (P ) × J (P ) for some poset Pwhich is isomorphic to (cid:24)+2 (B) ∼= (cid:24)−2 (B). Since (cid:24)+(cid:4)1, I2 (B). For any two elements (I1, I2), (I2 (B) with that in (cid:24)−(cid:4)2) ∈ J 2((cid:24)2(B)),2 (B),• (I1, I2) (cid:2)1 (I• (I1, I2) (cid:2)2 (I(cid:4)1, I(cid:4)1, I(cid:4)2) if I1 ⊆ I2 and I(cid:4)2) if I1 ⊆ I2 and I(cid:4)1(cid:4)1⊇ I⊆ I(cid:4)2;(cid:4)2.The above representation theorem tells us that B is isomorphic to (cid:9) J 2((cid:24)2(B)), (cid:2)1, (cid:2)2(cid:10). It also connects bilattice theoryto the well-known four-valued logic [5].FOUR, the structure that corresponds to Belnap’s four-valued logic [5], is the minimal bilattice, exactly as the structure2 = {true, false} or {0, 1} that is based on the classical two valued logic is the minimal Boolean algebra. It plays an importantrole in bilattice-based multi-valued logics. The Hasse diagram of the lattice FOUR is illustrated in Fig. 4.Following Dunn [17], we interpret FOUR in terms of the power set of {0, 1}. The meaning of the capital letters attachedto the elements of FOUR in the above figure is obvious from this type of interpretation. For example, B informally means“both” and can be translated as both “true” (1) and “false” (0). The truth ordering (cid:2)t can be formalized as follows: for anytwo elements x, y ∈ {T , F , N, B},x (cid:2)t y if both 1 ∈ x implies 1 ∈ y and 0 ∈ y implies 0 ∈ x.The lattice FOUR is the tuple (cid:9){T , F , N, B}, ∨, ∧, ∼(cid:10) where ∧ and ∨ are the lattice operations associated with the abovetruth ordering. Also we define ∼ as an order inverting that leaves N and B as fixed points, i.e., ∼ N = N, ∼ B = B,∼ T = F , ∼ F = T . Then meaning of this negation ∼ will be clear from the following semantical meaning of formulas(See Remark 4.7).It is interesting to note that there is a natural knowledge ordering implicit in the above lattice FOUR. The knowledgeordering (cid:2)k is defined as follows: for any two elements x, y ∈ {T , F , N, B},x (cid:2)k y if both 1 ∈ x implies 1 ∈ y and 0 ∈ x implies 0 ∈ y.So the lattices operations (cid:22) and (cid:23) associated with (cid:2)k are simply the usual set operations ∩ and ∪. It is easy to checkthat (cid:9){T , F , N, B}, ∨, ∧, (cid:22), (cid:23), ∼, (cid:10) is a distributive bilattice. It is actually the smallest distributive bilattice. 2 is simply thesublattice (cid:9){T , F }, ∧, ∨(cid:10) of the reduct (cid:9){T , F , N, B}, ∧, ∨(cid:10).The interpretations of standard propositional formulas in FOUR form exactly a distributive bilattice. Moreover, it wasshown in [2] that all the natural bilattice-valued logics that we had introduced for various purposes can be characterizedusing only the four basic “epistemic truth values”. The meaning of such epistemic truth values highly differs from themeaning of standard Boolean truth values since they are not intrinsic to propositions but are intended to reflect what anagent may have been informed about (regarding these propositions). Thus, interpreting a proposition ϕ as 0 (resp., 1) doesnot mean that ϕ is false (resp., true) but that the agent under consideration has some reasons to consider that ϕ is false(resp., true) or is told that ϕ is “false” (resp. “true”). The agent may have some reasons to consider that ϕ is false and otherreasons to consider that ϕ is true, and the epistemic truth value B reflects this situation. Similarly, the agent may have noreasons to consider ϕ as true and no reasons to consider it as false; in this situation, ϕ is given the epistemic truth value N(or ∅). So B reflects a situation of inconsistency and N of ignorance. The epistemic nature in the interpretations into FOURagrees well with Shafer’s emphasis of the epistemic nature of the set of possibilities on the frame of discernment in histheory (page 36 in [52]) but under incomplete or inconsistent information.C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3121In order to reason about belief functions for the four-valued logic, we expand Φ0 in the last section to Φ by adding theconnective negation ∼. In other words, a formula in Φ is formed by the following syntax:ϕ := p |∼ ϕ | ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 | ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2where p is a propositional letter.A valuation v into the lattice FOUR is a function from the set P of propositional letters into FOUR. It is easy to see thatv can be extended to the set of formulas naturally as follows:• v(∼ ϕ) =∼ v(ϕ);• v(ϕ ∧ ψ) = v(ϕ) ∧ v(ψ);• v(ϕ ∨ ψ) = v(ϕ) ∨ v(ψ).Following Belnap [5], we simply say “ϕ is at least true” if 1 ∈ v(ϕ); “ϕ is at least false” if 0 ∈ v(ϕ). It follows immediatelythat• 1 ∈ v(ϕ) iff 0 ∈ v(∼ ϕ), 0 ∈ v(ϕ) iff 1 ∈ v(∼ ϕ);• 1 ∈ v(ϕ ∨ ψ) iff 1 ∈ v(ϕ) or 1 ∈ v(ψ), 0 ∈ v(ϕ ∨ ψ) iff 0 ∈ v(ϕ) and 0 ∈ v(ψ);• 1 ∈ v(ϕ ∧ ψ) iff 1 ∈ v(ϕ) and 1 ∈ v(ψ), 0 ∈ v(ϕ ∧ ψ) iff 0 ∈ v(ϕ) or 0 ∈ v(ψ).In order to reason about belief functions on distributive bilattices, we simulate Kripke’s semantics for intuitionistic logic[35] and choose to define belief structures in a more abstract form.Definition 4.4. A Belnap structure is a tuple S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10) where• (cid:9)S, (cid:2)(cid:10) is a poset where S is a non-empty set of states called situations [37] or set-ups [16], which are like possibleworlds3 except that they are not required to be either consistent or complete;• for each s ∈ S, v(s) is a valuation into FOUR on the set of propositional letters such that the following persistencycondition is satisfied: for any s1, s2 ∈ S and propositional letter p,if s1 (cid:2) s2,then 1 ∈ v(s1)(p) implies 1 ∈ v(s2)(p) and 0 ∈ v(s1)(p) implies 0 ∈ v(s2)(p).It is a Boolean structure if (cid:2) is the identity relation and v is a valuation into 2.Two support relations between states and formulas [15,37] are defined inductively as follows:• S, s |(cid:25)T p if 1 ∈ v(s)(p),S, s |(cid:25)F p if 0 ∈ v(s)(p);• S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 if S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ1 and S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ2;S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 if S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ1 or S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ2;• S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2 if S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ1 or S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ2;S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2 if S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ1 and S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ2;• S, s |(cid:25)T ∼ ϕ if S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ;S, s |(cid:25)F ∼ ϕ if S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ.Note that, for any s ∈ S and any formula ϕ, 1 ∈ v(s)(ϕ) iff S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ and 0 ∈ v(s)(ϕ) iff S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ. Actually the persistencycondition for the valuation is satisfied by all formulas, as shown by the following lemma.Lemma 4.5. Let (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10) be a Belnap structure. If s1, s2 ∈ S and s1 (cid:2) s2, then, for any formula ϕ ∈ Φ,1. S, s1 |(cid:25)T ϕ implies S, s2 |(cid:25)T ϕ;2. S, s1 |(cid:25)F ϕ implies S, s2 |(cid:25)F ϕ.Proof. Let (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10) be a Belnap structure and s1, s2 ∈ S and s1 (cid:2) s2. We prove by induction on the complexity of ϕ. Herewe only prove the case that ϕ =∼ ϕ(cid:4). The proof of the other cases is straightforward.We reason as follows:S, s1 |(cid:25)T ϕ ⇒ S, s1 |(cid:25)F ϕ(cid:4)3 Possible worlds are required to be both consistent and complete.22andC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31⇒ S, s2 |(cid:25)F ϕ(cid:4)⇒ S, s2 |(cid:25)T ∼ ϕ(cid:4)(Induction hypothesis)S, s1 |(cid:25)F ϕ ⇒ S, s1 |(cid:25)T ϕ(cid:4)⇒ S, s1 |(cid:25)T ϕ(cid:4)⇒ S, s1 |(cid:25)F ∼ ϕ(cid:4)(Induction hypothesis).(cid:2)Remark 4.6. The persistency condition in a Belnap structure is quite similar to that in the Kripke semantics for intuitionisticlogic [35,64]. Following the interpretation of the non-standard propositional logic in [20], we analyze the above semanticsin terms of knowledge-bases. Each state s can be seen as a pair of knowledge bases. The set of formulas that are at leasttrue at s is the knowledge base of true facts and the set of formulas which are at least false at s constitutes the knowledgebase for the false facts. This pair of knowledge evolves in the course of time. Both the knowledge base of true facts and thatof false facts expand at every later stage. They are considered to be independent of each other and both take the open-worldassumption, which also explains the incompleteness in the information in another way. So the essential difference of ourinterpretation from that in intuitionistic logic is that the persistency condition here considers not only the knowledge oftrue facts but also that of false facts.Let [[ϕ]]T denote the set of all states where ϕ is “told true” {s ∈ S: S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ} and [[ϕ]]F = {s ∈ S: S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ} for allformulas ϕ. It is easy to check that both of them are filters in (S, (cid:2)). Denote(cid:28)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:29)B =[[ϕ]]T , [[ϕ]]F: ϕ ∈ Φ.We can define two partial orders on B.• ([[ϕ1]]T , [[ϕ1]]F ) (cid:2)1 ([[ϕ2]]T , [[ϕ2]]F ) if [[ϕ1]]T ⊆ [[ϕ2]]T and [[ϕ1]]F ⊇ [[ϕ2]]F ;• ([[ϕ1]]T , [[ϕ1]]F ) (cid:2)2 ([[ϕ2]]T , [[ϕ2]]F ) if [[ϕ1]]T ⊆ [[ϕ2]]T and [[ϕ1]]F ⊆ [[ϕ2]]F .Remark 4.7. The four valued logic is employed to decouple the bipolar information in the semantics. And the interpretationof each formula ϕ is decomposed into two parts: the part for the epistemic truth and the other part for the epistemic falsity.For the partial ordering (cid:2)1, the agent has more reasons to consider ϕ2 as true than ϕ1 and more reasons to consider ϕ1 asfalse than ϕ2. In other words, ϕ2 is considered at least as true as and at most as false as ϕ1. The agent is more confidentin considering that overall ϕ2 is at least as true as ϕ1. This is the reason why (cid:2)1 is also called the truth ordering. For theother ordering (cid:2)2, the agent has both more reasons to consider ϕ2 as true than ϕ1 and more reasons to consider ϕ2 asfalse than ϕ1. So the agent is more informative (in reasons) about ϕ2 than about ϕ1. This is the reason why (cid:2)2 is called theinformation or knowledge ordering.It is easy to check that the associated structure B := (cid:9)B, (cid:2)1, (cid:2)2(cid:10) is a distributive bilattice with the following negation:(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)∼[[ϕ]]T , [[ϕ]]F=[[ϕ]]F , [[ϕ]]T=[[∼ ϕ]]T , [[∼ ϕ]]F(cid:13).Intuitively, for each formula ϕ, [[ϕ]]T and [[ϕ]]F are the positive and negative sides of the interpretation of this formulaand they correspond to positive and negative elements in the bilattice B, respectively.Definition 4.8. A formula ψ is a logical consequence of a formula ϕ (ϕ logically implies ψ ) with respect to the class B ofBelnap structures (denoted ϕ |(cid:25)B ψ ) if, for any Belnap structure S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10) and any s ∈ S, S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ implies S, s |(cid:25)T ψand S, s |(cid:25)F ψ implies S, s |(cid:25)F ϕ.Now we investigate deductive system for this logical implication |(cid:25)Bwith respect to the class of Belnap structures. Thefollowing is the deductive system R f de which is the well-known first-degree entailment fragment of the relevance logic R[1,16]. Without further notice, (cid:31) denotes (cid:31) and ϕ (cid:31) ψ is short for both ϕ (cid:31) ψ and ψ (cid:31) ϕ.Axioms:ϕ (cid:31) ϕϕ ∧ ψ (cid:31) ϕ,ϕ (cid:31) ϕ ∨ ψ,ϕ ∧ (ψ ∨ γ ) (cid:31) (ϕ ∨ ψ) ∧ (ψ ∨ γ )∼ (ϕ ∧ ψ) (cid:31)∼ ϕ∨ ∼ ψϕ ∧ ψ (cid:31) ψψ (cid:31) ϕ ∨ ψϕ (cid:31)∼∼ ϕ∼ (ϕ ∨ ψ) (cid:31)∼ ϕ∧ ∼ ψSelf-implication(∧-elimination)(∨-introduction)(Double Negation)(de Morgan laws)C.

A Dempster–Shafer structure B (DS-structure for short) on a Belnap structure is a tuple (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v, Bel(cid:10) where• S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10) is a Belnap structure;• Bel is a belief function on (cid:9)F (S) × F (S), (cid:2)t(cid:10) = (cid:9){(I, I(cid:4)) : I and I(cid:4)are filters in S}, (cid:2)t(cid:10).Note that, for any (I1, I2), (I(cid:4)1, I(cid:4)2) ∈ F (S) × F (S), if (I1, I2) (cid:2)t (I(cid:4)(cid:4)2, then Bel(I1, I2) (cid:2) Bel(I1 and I2 ⊇ IF ) denotes the pair of the set of states where ϕ is satisfied, i.e., [[ϕ]]S(cid:4)2), i.e., I1 ⊆ I(cid:4)1, ITFor the Belnap structure (cid:9)S, (cid:2), v(cid:10), ([[ϕ]]SS: S, s |(cid:25)T ϕ}, which can be shown to be a filter in S, and that of states where ϕ is falsified, i.e., [[ϕ]]SFwhich can be shown to be also a filter in S.

The standard fuzzyalgebra F = (cid:9)[0, 1], max(x, y), min(x, y), 0, 1, 1 − x(cid:10) is an example of a de Morgan lattice. Moreover, de Morgan lattices arethe algebraic semantics for relevance logic [16]. In this part, we investigate belief functions on de Morgan lattices whichcovers those for fuzzy events [68,55,66]. It is interesting to note that the first degree entailments R f de also provides acalculus for reasoning about de Morgan lattices. In the following, we will give a presentation of the semantics in termsof de Morgan lattices which is in parallel to that for bilattices. For simplicity, we will not repeat those motivations whichare similar to those in last part about bilattices but simply present the main ideas. Note that the ∧1-∨1-¬-reduct of adistributive bilattice B = (cid:9)B, ∧1, ∨1, ∧(cid:4)2, ¬(cid:10) is a de Morgan lattice.1, ∨(cid:4)We need the following duality theorem for finite de Morgan lattices which is based on [7,16,62,45]:Theorem 4.13. Any finite de Morgan lattice D can be represented as the lattice J (P D ) of order ideals in the subposet P D of join-irreducibles with an order-reversing involution g. And there is a one-to-one correspondence between de Morgan lattices and posetswith order-reversing involutions.So each de Morgan lattice can be regarded as a poset with an order-reversing involution. Similarly, in order to reasonabout belief functions on de Morgan lattices, we choose to define underlying structures in a more abstract form.24C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31Definition 4.14. A Routley structure is a tuple S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10) where• (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g(cid:10) is a poset with an order-reversing involution g;• For each s ∈ S, v(s) is a valuation into 2 = {true, false} on the set of propositional letters satisfying the following persis-tency condition: for any s1, s2 ∈ S and propositional letter p,if s1 (cid:2) s2 and v(s1)(p) = true,then v(s2)(p) = true.It is a Boolean structure if (cid:2) is the identity relation and g is the identity function on S.From the persistency condition, we may immediately derive a “reverse” persistency condition as follows: for anys1, s2 ∈ S and propositional letter p,if s1 (cid:2) s2 and v(cid:12)(cid:13)g(s2)(p) = true,then v(cid:12)(cid:13)g(s1)(p) = true.A satisfaction relation between states and formulas can be defined exactly as in standard propositional logic except thefollowing clause for negationS, s |(cid:25)∼ ϕ if S, g(s) (cid:3)|(cid:25) ϕ.Actually the persistency condition for the valuation is satisfied by all formulas, as shown in the following proposition.Lemma 4.15. Let (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10) be a Routley structure. If s1, s2 ∈ S and s1 (cid:2) s2, then, for any formula ϕ,1. S, s1 |(cid:25) ϕ implies S, s2 |(cid:25) ϕ;2. S, g(s2) |(cid:25) ϕ implies S, g(s1) |(cid:25) ϕ.Remark 4.16. The persistency condition in a Routley structure is quite similar to that in the Kripke semantics for intuition-istic logic [64]. Each pair (s, g(s)) of a state s and its adjunct can be seen as a pair of knowledge bases. s is the knowledgebase consisting of true facts and g(s) is the knowledge base for the false facts. Here we take the closed-world assumption [46]for g(s) in the sense that, if a proposition is not implied in g(s), then the negation of this proposition is implied at s. Thispair of knowledge evolves in the course of time. The knowledge base of true facts expands at every later stage while theknowledge base for false facts decreases. So the essential difference from those in Belnap structures is that the knowledgeof true facts and that for false facts are rather dual to each other than independent of each other as in Belnap structures.If the second (reverse) persistency condition is replaced by a new adjunct but independent valuation vwhich is defined∗(s) = v(g(s)), then we may also define a Routley structure as a poset (cid:9)S, (cid:2) g(cid:10) with an order-reversing involution gsatisfying the following two persistency conditions:as vand two “independent” but adjunct-to-each-other valuations v and v∗∗• if s1 (cid:2) s2, v(s1)(p) = true implies v(s2)(p) = true for all propositional letters p;• if s1 (cid:2) s2, v∗(s1)(p) = true for all propositional letters p.∗(s2)(p) = true implies vThe new valuation v∗is for false facts. So the semantics with this new type of Routley structures is the same as theabove except that for the negated formulas:(S, v), s |(cid:25)∼ ϕ if(cid:12)S, v(cid:13)∗, s (cid:3)|(cid:25) ϕ.The adjunct valuation is used to decouple the semantics to interpret negation. Since there is a straightforward interpre-tation between this semantics and the above one, they are equivalent. So each possibility in the epistemic frame for belieffunctions on Routley structures (Definition 4.19) consists of a pair of valuations. It would be interesting to compare this pairwith the two support relations |(cid:25)T and |(cid:25)F in the valuation for the four-valued logic. Note that, although Routley semanticsand Belnap semantics are different, the notion of satisfiability in the two semantics are equivalent (Proposition 9.1 in [20]).The connection (duality) between Routley structures and de Morgan lattices can be analyzed as follows. Define an equiv-alence relation ! on Φ,ϕ1 ! ϕ2iff ϕ1 (cid:31) ϕ2 and ϕ2 (cid:31) ϕ1.Let Φ/! denote the set of !-equivalence classes [ϕ]!. Now we define the operations on this set as follows:• [ϕ1]! ∧! [ϕ2]! = [ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2]!;• [ϕ1]! ∨! [ϕ2]! = [ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2]!;• ∼! [ϕ]! = [∼ ϕ]!.C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3125It is easy to check that these operations are well-defined. Such a defined algebra (cid:9)Φ/!, ∧!, ∨!, ∼!(cid:10) is the Lindenbaumalgebra on Φ/! and is actually a de Morgan lattice.With respect to Φ, we define the canonical Routley structure as follows.• SΦ is the set of all prime filters in Φ/ !;• gΦ : SΦ → SΦ is defined: for each F ∈ SΦ , gΦ (F ) = Φ/!\ ∼! F where ∼! F = {∼! [ϕ]! : [ϕ]! ∈ F }, which is a primefiler;• vΦ (F )(p) = true if [p]! ∈ F for any F ∈ SΦ .It is easy to check that (cid:9)SΦ , (cid:2)Φ , gΦ (cid:10) is a poset with the order-reversing involution gΦ where (cid:2)Φ is the subset relation.If Φ is finite, according to the dual form of the representation theorem for finite de Morgan lattices, the Lindenbaum algebra(cid:9)Φ/!, ∧!, ∨!, ∼!(cid:10) is isomorphic to the concrete lattice of filters in the poset (cid:9)SΦ , (cid:2)Φ , gΦ (cid:10) which underlies the canonicalRoutley structure.Definition 4.17. A formula ϕ logically implies a formula ψ with respect to the class of Routley structures (denoted as ϕ |(cid:25)R ψ )if, for any Routley structure S = (cid:9)S, g, v(cid:10), S, s |(cid:25) ϕ implies S, s |(cid:25) ψ .The difference of this definition from that for Belnap structures (Definition 4.8) is that we don’t need to consider the“negative side”. Actually the logical implication relation in the class of Routley structures coincides with the above conse-quence relation (cid:31)R f de .Theorem 4.18. (See Theorem 7 in [17].) For any two formulas ϕ and ψ in Φ,ϕ (cid:31) ψ iff ϕ |(cid:25)R ψ.Definition 4.19. A Dempster–Shafer structure B (DS-structure for short) on a de Morgan lattice is a tuple (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v, Bel(cid:10)where• S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10) is a Routley structure;• Bel is a belief function on F (S) = {I ⊆ S: I is a filter in S}.For the Routley structure (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10), [[ϕ]]S denotes the set of states where ϕ is satisfied, i.e., [[ϕ]]S = {s ∈ S: S, s |(cid:25) ϕ},which can be shown to be a filter in S. So the belief in the formula ϕ is defined to be Bel([[ϕ]]S ). Compared with belieffunctions on bilattices, belief functions on de Morgan lattices are much simpler in the following sense. In a Belnap structureB, [[ϕ]]B⊇ [[ψ]]BF ; in other words, the fact the agent have more reasonsTto consider ψ as true than ϕ does not imply that the agent have more reasons to consider ϕ false than ψ . However, thisis not the case in a Routley structure. So, in the definition of belief functions for de Morgan lattices, we don’t need toconsider the second parameter of the set of facts that falsify the proposition. Our definition here agrees with the definitionof DS-structures in Definition 3.20.T does not necessarily imply that [[ϕ]]B⊆ [[ψ]]BFDefinition 4.20. For any two formulas ϕ and ψ in Φ, ϕ probabilistically entails ψ with respect to the class of de MorganD S ψ ) if, for any DS-structure S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v, Bel(cid:10), Bel([[ϕ]]S ) (cid:2) Bel([[ψ]]S ).lattices (denoted as ϕ |(cid:25)RThe following theorem tells us that the deductive system R f de provides a sound and complete system for both logi-cal implication but also probabilistic entailment with respect to both the class of Belnap structures and that of Routleystructures.Theorem 4.21. For any formulas ϕ and ψ in Φ, ϕ (cid:31) ψ if and only if ϕ |(cid:25)RD S ψ .Proof. The proof is similar to that for Theorem 4.12. (cid:2)The following theorem tells us that the logical implication problem with respect to the class of Routley-structures (Belnapstructures) is as hard as logical implication in standard propositional logic.Theorem 4.22. The complexity of deciding logical implication with respect to the class of Routley structures (Belnap structures) isco-NP-complete.Proof. The proof can be easily adapted from that of the similar problem in Section 8 in [20] (also [63,37]). (cid:2)26C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–315. Reasoning about belief functions for first-degree entailmentsIn this section, we provide a sound and complete deductive system for reasoning about belief functions for first de-gree entailments and show that the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the corresponding class ofDempster–Shafer structures is NP-complete.In this part, we adapt the deductive machineries in [19,18] to provide a sound and complete axiomatization for reasoningabout belief functions over Routley structures (Belnap structures).Definition 5.1. For the above given set Φ of formulas, a term is an expression of the form a1bel(ϕ1) + a2bel(ϕ2) + · · · +akbel(ϕk), where a1, a2, . . . , ak are integers, bel is the belief function symbol and ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕk are formulas in Φ. A basicbelief formula is one of the form t (cid:3) b, where t is a term and b is an integer. A belief formula is a Boolean combination ofbasic belief formulas. We can always allow rational numbers in our formulas as abbreviations for the formula that wouldbe obtained by clearing the dominator. And other derived relations =, (cid:2), < and > can be defined as usual.Definition 5.2. Given a DS-structure B = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v, Bel(cid:10) on a Routley structure S := (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10) and a basic belief formulaf := a1bel(ϕ1) + a2bel(ϕ2) + · · · + akbel(ϕk) (cid:3) b, B satisfies f (denoted as B |(cid:25) f ) if(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:13)a1 Bel[[ϕ1]]S+ a2 Bel(cid:3) b.We then extend the above |(cid:25) in the obvious way to all belief formulas.

(e) is the connection of reasoning about belief functions to first degree entailments.Theorem 5.4. B f de is a sound and complete axiomatization of belief formulas with respect to the class of DS-structures.Proof. The soundness is trivial except the principle 3(e), which follows from Theorem 4.21 (and Theorem 4.12). Here wemainly focus on the completeness proof. The completeness proof is similar to that of the system A X with respect to theC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3127class of general probability structures in [19] except that we need to replace propositional reasoning with reasoning aboutfirst degree entailments.Fix a belief formula f . Without loss of generality, we may assume that fis a conjunction of basic belief formulas andnegated basic belief formulas.4 Let P f = {p1, . . . , pk} be the set of all the propositional letters occurring in f and ΦP fbe the set of formulas in Φ with propositional letters occurring in P f . Recall that two formulas are !-equivalent iff theyare deductively equivalent in R f de . As in the duality between de Morgan lattices and Routley structures, we define theLindenbaum algebra (cid:9)ΦP f / !, ∧!, ∨!, ∼!(cid:10) as follows:• ΦP f / ! is the set of all !-equivalence classes [ϕ]! for all ϕ ∈ ΦP f , which can be easily shown to be finite;• for any two formulas ϕ, ψ whose propositional letters are in P f1. [ϕ]! ∧! [ψ]! = [ϕ ∧ ψ]!;2. [ϕ]! ∨! [ψ]! = [ϕ ∨ ψ]!;3. ∼! [ϕ]! = [∼ ϕ]!.It is easy to check that (cid:9)ΦP f / !, ∧!, ∨!, ∼!(cid:10) is a de Morgan lattice and it is isomorphic to the concrete lattice of the posetunderlying the dual canonical Routley structure which is defined as follows:\ ∼! F where ∼! F = {∼! [ϕ]! : [ϕ]! ∈ F }, which is a• SP f• gP fis the set of all prime filters in ΦP f / !;: SP fprime filer;→ SP fis defined: for each F ∈ SP f , g(F ) = SP f• vΦP(F )(p) = true if [p]! ∈ F for any F ∈ SΦPf.ffIn other words, ΦP f / ! is isomorphic to J (SΦP). Let h denote this isomorphic function. In the following, we won’tdistinguish between a formula and its equivalence class. Enumerate all formulas ϕ ∈ ΦP f :ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . , ϕm where ϕ0 ≡ ⊥ and ϕm ≡ (cid:11).Let x0, x1, . . . , xm be the variables that correspond to these formulas. Now we turn finto a group of linear inequalities.For each conjunct of f , say, a1bel(ϕ1) + · · · + akbel(ϕk) (cid:3) b, we replace each bel(ϕi) by the variable, say, xi that correspondsto ϕi and geta1x1 + · · · + akxk (cid:3) b.By collecting all these inequalities, we obtain a group ˆf of linear inequalities that captures the linear relations of beliefson different formulas in f . For each formula ϕi ∈ ΦP f , we have a new inequality:(cid:6)(−1)|h(ϕi )\h(ϕ j)|x j (cid:3) 0,[h(ϕ j ),h(ϕi )] is a Boolean algebra(10)where h(ϕ j), h(ϕi) are order ideals in SP f and [h(ϕ j), h(ϕi)] is an interval in J (SP f ). Intuitively, it says that the massassignment at each formula ϕi is nonnegative. The principle guiding the construction is Theorem 3.2. Let (cid:6)ΦP f denote theset of all linear inequalities of this kind.Claim 6. If f is satisfiable, then (cid:6)ΦP f has a solution.Assume that fis satisfied in a DS-structure S = (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v, Bel(cid:10). Let m be the corresponding mass assignment. Sinceeach term on the left side of the inequality 10 is actually the mass assignment m([[ϕi]]S ), it is nonnegative according toTheorem 3.3. So xi = Bel([[ϕi]]S )(0 (cid:2) i (cid:2) m) is a solution of (cid:6)ΦP f and hence we have proved the claim.Claim 7. f is satisfiable if and only if the following group of inequalities has a solution:(cid:31)f := ˆf ∪(cid:6)ΦP f∪ {x0 = 0, xm = 1}.From the above claim, the left-to-right direction follows immediately. Assume that (cid:31)f has a solution. Now we defineBel(ϕi) = xi(0 (cid:2) i (cid:2) m). From the constraints in (cid:31)f and Theorem 3.2, it follows that Bel is a belief function on the canonicalRoutley structure. Moreover, the constraints in ˆf guarantees that fis satisfied in this canonical structure.4 If fsatisfiable.is not a conjunction of this form, it is equivalent to a disjunction of conjunctions of this form. Then we consider any satisfiable conjunct if fis28C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31Now we are back to show the theorem. Assume that fhave a solution. Since A X Iq is a complete axiomatization for reasoning about linear inequalities, (cid:31)fSince (cid:6)ΦP fthat fis not consistent in B f de . So we have finished the whole proof of the theorem. (cid:2)∪ {x0 = 0, xm = 1} correspond to Axioms 3(b)(c)(d) in B f de , ˆfis unsatisfiable. It follows from the above claim that (cid:31)f does notis inconsistent in A X Iq.is not consistent in B f de . This is equivalent to sayLet | f | denote the length of the belief formula f which is the number of symbols required to write f , where we countthe length of each coefficient as 1 and $ f $ be the length of the longest coefficient appearing in f , when written in binary.Lemma 5.5. Let f be a belief formula that is satisfied in some DS-structure on a Routley structure (a Belnap structure). Then f issatisfied in a probability structure on a Boolean algebra with at most | f |2 states, with a basis of size at most | f |, where the probabilityassigned to each member of the basis is a rational number with size O (| f |$ f $ + | f | log(| f |)).Proof. From the results in Theorem 3.22 (particular from Corollary 3.23), we know that each DS-structure on a distributivelattice is equivalent to a probability structure on a Boolean algebra. Actually the whole argument there works to show thateach DS structure B := (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v, Bel(cid:10) on a de Morgan lattice J (S) (or on a Routley structure (cid:9)S, (cid:2), g, v(cid:10)) is equivalent to(cid:4)(cid:4), va probability structure M := (cid:9)Sinthe sense that, for any formula ϕ ∈ Φ,is a Boolean algebra and μ(cid:4)is a probability function on L(cid:4), μ(cid:4)(cid:10) where L = 2S(cid:4), L, L, L(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:12)Bel[[ϕ]]B(cid:13)(cid:12)= μ(cid:4)∗[[ϕ]]M(cid:13).Note that, compared to Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23), our equivalence here is stronger because the language Φ hereincludes the negation ∼ while Φ0 in Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23) does not. Then the lemma follows immediatelyfrom Theorem 3.10 in [19]. (cid:2)Theorem 5.6. The time complexity of deciding whether a belief formula is satisfiable with respect to the class of DS-structures isNP-complete.Proof. Since every probability structure is also a DS-structure, the theorem follows from Theorem 3.11 in [19]. The interestedreader may refer to [19] for the details. (cid:2)We may define logical implication for belief formulas as usual. The above theorem tells us that the complexity of thelogical implication problem with respect to the class of DS-structures on Routley structures is the same as that with respectto the class of Routley-structures (Theorem 4.22) and hence is not affected by the expansion of the propositional languagewith belief functions.6. Discussion and conclusionThe main contribution of this paper is the extension of Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions on Boolean algebrasto the setting of distributive lattices and show that many intuitively appealing properties in the theory are transposed tothis more general case. We use this more general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in adeductive approach on many non-classical formalisms in artificial intelligence which assume a setting of distributive lattices.As an illustration of this deductive approach, we apply this general theory to a non-classical formalism in the foundationsof Knowledge Representation the first-degree-entailment of relevance logic R.This kind of integration of uncertainty measures such as belief functions and logics for knowledge representation is animportant approach in reasoning under uncertain and imperfect knowledge in artificial intelligence [43]. Logics includingmany non-classical logics play a central role in the task of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence [42]. And eachof these logics was intended for some particular focus. On the other hand, uncertainty measures are usually to deal withuncertainty in information [31]. However, non-classical logics are not expressive enough to express uncertainty in a gradualway and uncertainty measures such as belief functions are not enough to handling imperfect information. This is anothermotivation to combine uncertainty measures with non-classical logics in addition to that mentioned at the beginning ofSection 4. Bernard and Lang applied possibility theory to non-classical logics especially paraconsistent logics and showedhow to reason under uncertain and inconsistent information [6]. Saffiotti proposed a formal framework to integrate logicsfor knowledge including first order logic and belief functions [49,48,50]. But none of these papers has touched any issueabout the mathematical foundation and computational complexity behind the theory of belief functions, just as we havedone in this paper. Here, we provide a sound and complete deductive system for reasoning about belief functions for asimple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R through different duality theorems betweenalgebraic semantics and logic. This axiomatization can be used to show how to deduce one belief of some events frombeliefs of others. Moreover, we have given the complexity result of the satisfiability problem of belief formulas in this kindof non-classical settings. The deductive approach for belief functions for first degree entailments can be applied to othernon-classical formalisms L that assume a setting of distributive lattices. The axiomatization BL for reasoning about beliefC. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–3129functions on L is simply obtained from the axiomatization B f de by replacing Part 1 of first degree entailments by L and theimplication ϕ (cid:31)R f de ψ in Principle 3 (e) in Part 3 by ϕ (cid:31)L ψ . In particular, our deductive approach also covers the formalismdeveloped by Bernard and Lang in [6].In the literature, there are many similar kinds of integration of belief functions with other non-classical formalisms inKnowledge Representation. In the theory of evidential reasoning on fuzzy events [68,55,56,66], a belief functions is notdefined in terms of mass assignments as in our paper but is defined to be a set function which is both monotonic and∞-monotonic. Moreover, it is defined indirectly either as an expectation of some membership function with respect to someother given belief function on the referential space [55,56] or as a probability function through some generalized compati-bility relation [66,68]. In the theory of bipolar belief pairs on vague propositions [36], a belief function is definedindirectlyas a probability function on some supervaluation pair and hence not in terms of mass assignments. Usually it is difficultto do evidential reasoning with this kind of definitions without reference to mass assignments because Dempster’s rule ofcombination is defined in terms of them. In contrast, in the theory developed in this paper, we define belief functions interms of mass assignment and moreover, characterize them without reference to mass assignments. So, our theory of belieffunctions on distributive lattices provides both a more transparent framework and a uniform foundation to do evidentialreasoning in the above settings.This paper is a theoretical framework for our ongoing project to apply belief functions to multi-valued reasoning inAI [25], decision-making with bipolar information [14] and adding belief annotations to databases [24] with incompleteand/or inconsistent knowledge where structures of interest are usually assumed to be no more Boolean but distributive. Ourimmediate task is to investigate information fusion in belief functions for distributive bilattice reasoning [25].The perspective of this paper mainly views belief functions as generalized probability functions. Now we are also workingon another different perspective regarding belief functions for evidence and are doing evidential reasoning for non-classicalformalisms. A further project, which is probably more of theoretical interest, is to develop a theory of belief functions forquantum structures (not necessarily distributive) which would relate quantum computation and AI [67].AcknowledgementsThis research is partly supported by Technische Universität Dortmund (Informatik 10), by the Key Project for basic re-search from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant Number: 2012CB316205), by NSF of China (GrantNumber: 60905036), and by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD Codenumber: A/10/00803).I am more than grateful to Professor Ernst-Erich Doberkat for his support of my research these years.

Some properties of distributive latticesA lattice L is called a modular lattice if its elements satisfy the following condition:if x (cid:2) z,then x ∨ ( y ∧ z) (cid:2) (x ∨ y) ∧ z.(11)With the following proposition, we know that a belief function can be defined on any lattice while probability functionscan live only on distributive lattices.Proposition A.1. (See Lemma 3 in [26].) Let L be a lattice. Then1. L is a modular if and only if it admits a strictly monotone 2-valuation.2. L is distributive if and only if it is modular and every strictly monotone 2-valuation on L is a 3-valuation.3. L is distributive if and only if it admits a strictly monotone 3-valuation.4. L is distributive if and only if it is modular and every strictly monotone 2-valuation on L is an ∞-valuation.Given a poset P ,J (P ) denotes the lattice of order ideals of P . The lattice operations ∨ and ∧ on order ideals are justordinary union and intersection (as subsets of P ). The interested reader may refer to Section 3.4 in [61] (and Chapter IX in[9]) for the detailed proofs of the following propositions.Theorem A.2. Let L be a finite distributive lattice. Then there is a unique (up to isomorphism) finite poset P for which L ∼= J (P ).30C. Zhou / Artificial Intelligence 201 (2013) 1–31This theorem is so important in combinatorial aspects of distributive lattices that it is called by Stanley the fundamentaltheorem for finite distributive lattices [61].Lemma A.3. Let I (cid:2) Iinduced subposet of P . In particular, [I, I(cid:4)(cid:4)] is a distributive lattice.in the distributive lattice J (P ). The interval [I, I(cid:4)] is isomorphic to J (I(cid:4) \ I), where I(cid:4) \ I is regarded as anTheorem A.4. If P is an n-element poset, then J (P ) is graded of rank n. Moreover, the rank ρ(I) of I ∈ J (P ) is just the cardinality of I .References[1] B. Anderson, N.
