Epilepsy is a braindisorder described by recurrent and unpredictable interruption of healthy brain function. Diagnosis of patientswith epilepsy requires monitoring and visual inspection of long-term EEG by the neurologist, which is found tobe a time-consuming procedure. Therefore, this study proposes an automated seizure detection model using anovel computationally efficient feature named sigmoid entropy derived from discrete wavelet transforms. Thesigmoid entropy was estimated from the wavelet coefficients in each sub-band and classified using a non-linearsupport vector machine classifier with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The performance of the proposedmethod was tested with the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (RMCH) database, which consists of the 58Hours of EEG from 115 subjects, the University of Bonn (UBonn), and CHB-MIT databases. Results showed thatsigmoid entropy exhibits lower values for epileptic EEG in contrary to other existing entropy methods. Weobserve a seizure detection rate of 96.34%, a false detection rate of 0.5/h and a mean detection delay of 1.2 s forthe RMCH database. The highest sensitivity of 100% and 94.21% were achieved for UBonn and CHB-MIT da-tabases respectively. The performance comparison confirms that sigmoid entropy was found to be better andcomputationally efficient as compared to other entropy methods. It can be concluded that the proposed sigmoidentropy could be used as a potential biomarker for recognition and detection of epileptic seizures.1. IntroductionEpilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain and willhave a profound influence on patients’ daily lives. A sudden dischargeof electrical activity in the brain causes temporary brain dysfunction,which is referred to as a seizure, and recurrent seizures lead to epilepsy[1,2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that epilepsyaffects 50 million people worldwide [2]. The electroencephalogram(EEG) signals have proven to be a potential biomarker for detection andrecognition of epilepsy [1]. A thorough inspection of the long-term EEGrecordings is necessary to recognize the abnormal EEG patterns, whichare found to be time-consuming, costly and leading to human errors.Though several automated, computer-aided algorithms for seizure de-tection were proposed earlier, there is still scope for identifying betterbiomarkers for real-time seizure detection.Neurological disorders cause changes in EEG patterns, which couldbe used as a marker for the diagnosis. It was shown that non-linearmethods could provide potential markers for EEG analysis over con-ventional methods [1,3,4] however, several limitations exist whichneeds to be solved. To design an automated seizure detection system, itis essential to extract features that describe the morphology of theepileptic seizures from EEG signals in a better manner. Studies havereported that the best feature significantly improves the algorithmperformance [5–7]. Thus, we propose a novel feature named sigmoid∗Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: r.raghu@maastrichtuniversity.nl (S. Raghu), sriraam@msrit.edu (N.

Raghu, et al.Computers in Biology and Medicine 110 (2019) 127–143entropy derived from the sigmoid function that offers a significantnonlinear behavior to capture robust markers for seizure detection.For epileptic seizure detection, studies based on non-linear entropyhave shown significant results in terms of sensitivity as compared toother known EEG derived features. It can be observed from the litera-ture that variations of entropy methods have been applied for seizuredetection [5–14]. Different entropy methods such as approximationentropy (ApEn), sample entropy, phase entropy 1 and phase entropy 2have been used for the automatic detection of normal, pre-ictal, and theictal conditions [5]. Among the seven different classifiers described inRef. [5], fuzzy classifier showed the highest accuracy of 98.1%. Per-mutation entropy was used to identify the changes in EEG signalsduring absence seizures [8,11]. A method based on discrete wavelettransforms (DWT), and ApEn obtained 100% classification accuracyusing an artificial neural network [12]. Srinivasan et al. showed aclassification accuracy of 100% between normal and epileptic EEGusing ApEn and artificial neural network classifier [9]. Optimizedsample entropy with extreme learning machine method showed a highaccuracy of 99.0% [10]. Fuzzy entropy and support vector machine(SVM) based approach for the detection of epileptic seizures showedacceptable results [13]. Acharya et al. [15] gave a systematic review ofthe application of various entropy methods to differentiate normal,interictal, and ictal EEG signals. A patient non-specific algorithmshowed a specificity of 99.9%, sensitivity of 87.5% and a false positiverate 0.9/h [16].In Ref. [17], weighted permutation entropy showed distinguishableband for seizure and normal EEG segments. An accuracy of 99.0% wasachieved using SVM classifier between healthy subjects (with eyes openand closed) and epileptic patients [17]. Automated threshold-baseddetection of epileptic seizures was proposed using a novel feature calledminimum variance modified fuzzy entropy [18]. In this study, relativeenergy was used as a membership function to estimate fuzzy entropyand an accuracy of 100% was obtained using the threshold method. InRefs. [17,18], lower entropy was observed for epileptic seizures EEG,which were in contrary to other entropy methods proposed in Refs.[9,12,19,20]. Wavelet packet transforms followed by log energy andnorm entropy showed an accuracy of 99.7% using recurrent Elmanneural network [20]. Further, Renyi, spectral, Shannon and waveletentropy methods were explored for the classification of epileptic sei-zures [19,21–23]. The above-mentioned entropy-based studies de-monstrated promising classification results for epileptic seizure detec-tion.achieved a classification accuracy of 98.25% [37]. Multivariate em-pirical mode decomposition along with artificial neural network wasused to classify ictal and non-ictal EEG signals [38]. In another study,non-linear dimension technique was used to reduce the frequency do-main features and the seizure/non-seizure events were classified usingKNN classifier [39].A number of studies [12,20,22,24,26–28,34,40–46] have employedwavelet transforms for seizure detection and have reported promisingresults. Therefore, in this study, EEG signal was decomposed using DWTwith five different wavelet functions.The thorough literature survey suggests that the classification re-sults could be further improved through an optimal selection of thefeature extraction method and classifier. It is essential that the algo-rithm computation time should be very short for real-time seizure de-tection. Hence, in this study, in order to achieve better performanceover existing methods, a novel feature referred to as sigmoid entropyderived from DWT coefficients was introduced. A SVM model was lateremployed to classify seizure and non seizure patterns.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a briefdescription of the sigmoid entropy and the database used for the studyis described. The results of the study are presented in Section 3 andperformance comparison is discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5concludes the paper.2. Methodology2.1. Proposed methodFig. 1 depicts the block diagram of the proposed seizure detectionalgorithm that uses a DWT based sigmoid entropy and SVM classifier.The EEG recordings were pre-processed using a notch filter and abandpass filter to remove any noise. An independent component ana-lysis was performed to remove any artifacts. The EEG was segmentedinto 1 s length to maintain the stationarity of the signal. Further, theEEG signal was decomposed using DWT consisting of five differentOn the other hand, a framework using DWT and SVM was proposedfor the epileptic focus localization problem [24]. In this study, sevencommonly used wavelet families (Coiflets, Daubechies, Discrete Meyer,Haar, Biorthogonal, Reverse biorthogonal, Symlets) were considered forthe EEG signal decomposition. An accuracy of 88.0% was obtainedusing optimal frequency bands and wavelet coefficient features. Sta-tistical features extracted from wavelet decomposed EEG were classi-fied using the relevance vector machine (RVM) classifier [25]. Simi-larly, statistical features estimated from DWT showed an accuracy of97.83% using combined neural network model [26]. Faust et al. [27]proposed a review on wavelet-based EEG processing for seizure detec-tion. Further, signal energy [28], Eigenvalues [29], and 21 differentfeatures [30] were investigated for the classification of epileptic sei-zures and promising results were reported. Transfer learning semi-su-pervised learning fuzzy system based model was found to be compu-tationally intensive for solving real-time seizure detection [31]. A deepconvolution neural network-based approach was introduced recentlyfor automated seizure detection using EEG signals [32,33]. The SVMclassifier has been extensively used for epileptic seizure detection duetoresults[24,30,34,35].generalization abilityand promisingefficientitsA specific study on the prediction of epileptic seizures using long-short-term memory network was reported, wherein 185 seizures werepredicted correctly [36].

Raghu, et al.Computers in Biology and Medicine 110 (2019) 127–143mother wavelets. Subsequently, sigmoid entropy was estimated in bothtime and frequency domain using amplitude and power spectral densityof the EEG signal. Finally, the extracted features were classified usingSVM classifier with the segment and event-based approaches and theperformance of the algorithm was evaluated using three databases.2.2. Clinical dataIn this study, three EEG databases were used to validate the pro-posed seizure detection algorithm. The first database was obtained fromthe Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals (RMCH), Bengaluru, India.Ethical clearance was obtained from the RMCH ethics committee tostudy EEG recordings for research purpose. The unipolar scalp EEG wasrecorded using 19 electrodes placed according to the International10–20 system of configuration at a sampling rate of 128 Hz usingGalileo Suite-EB Neuro EEG system. The database comprises of 115subjects, which include 67 male and 48 female, ranging between 2.5and 75 years of age. Among the 115 subjects, 38 were suffered fromepilepsy and 77 were healthy subjects. The scalp EEG was recordedfrom the following electrode positions: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3,C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, and O2. Two experts with thesame display setting were visually labeled the EEG recordings as normaland epileptic events. The seizure activities with a minimum duration of6 s and a maximum of any period were considered for the study.The second database used in our study was a publicly availabledatabase from the University of Bonn (UBonn)1 [47]. The EEG re-cordings were obtained from Five different patients who have under-gone presurgical evaluations. The EEG recordings in UBonn databasewere divided into five sets (A-E), each set consisting of 100 singlechannel EEG segments of 23.6 s duration recorded at a sampling rate of173.61 Hz. Each subset A, B, C, D, and E represent the states of normalwith eyes open, normal with eyes closed, pre-ictal, post-ictal and ictalrespectively. For this study, classification problems, namely {A}-{E},{ACD}-{E}, {ABCD}-{E}, and {AB}-{CD}-{E} were formed using fivedifferent subsets [12,29,46,48].The third database was collected from CHB-MIT [49], an open-source EEG available in Physionet repository.2 This database consists of844 h of EEG recordings, which comprises of 182 seizures recordedfrom 23 patients. The recordings were obtained from 23 channelsplaced according to 10–20 International system bipolar montage elec-trode placement and recorded at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. One canrefer to the [49,50] for more details on the EEG database and patientinformation.2.3. PreprocessingFor the RMCH database, EEG was pre-processed using suitablesignal processing techniques. A 50 Hz notch filter was used to attenuatethe power line interference. Further, EEG time series were filtered usinga bandpass filter with the lower and a higher cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hzand 40 Hz respectively. An independent component analysis was ap-plied to the EEG signal to remove artifacts such as eye blinks, chewing,muscular artifacts, etc [51]. In our study, filtering techniques were notemployed on UBonn and CHB-MIT databases as the available data wasalready pre-processed.2.4. Discrete wavelet transformDWT is a spectral analysis technique that provides a multi-resolu-tion and time-frequency analysis of non-stationary EEG signal [52,53].DWT has been used extensively for seizure detection and promising1 http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3&changelang=3.2 http://www.physionet.org/pn6/chbmit.129results were achieved [12,20,22,24,26–28,34,40–45]. DWT comprisespairs of low pass filter (approximation coefficients) and high pass filter(detail coefficients). At each level of DWT, the signal is simultaneouslypassed through a set of low pass filter and high pass filter followed bydownsampler (refer Fig. 2). The selection of the decomposition leveldepends on the dominantthe signals[40,52–54].frequency components ofThe wavelet ψi can be obtained from the following relationship[52]:i2ψ=12∞∑=−∞kh k ψ( )it2⎛⎝− ⎞k⎠i2+1ψ=12∞∑=−∞kg k ψ( )it2⎛⎝− ⎞k⎠(1)(2)Here, i is the modulation parameter, k is the translation parameter,ψi is the mother wavelet, h k( ) is the low pass filter and g k( ) is the highpass filter associated with the scaling function and the mother waveletfunction [52,53].The wavelet coefficient cj ki,(j is the dilation parameter) corre-sponding to a signal s t( ) can be obtained as [52],∞cij k,∫=−∞is t ψ t dtj k,( )( )(3)Based on the previous studies reported on seizure detection[12,22,27,28,34,40–42,44,45], we have selected five most commonlyused wavelets, namely Haar, Coiflets (Coif4), Discrete Meyer (Dmey),Biorthogonal (Bior3.1) and Reverse Biorthogonal (Rbio3.1). Thesestudies have proved that above-mentioned mother wavelets were wellsuited for EEG signal analysis.Fig. 2 shows the structure of wavelet decomposition of an EEGsignal up to the fifth level. The decomposition levels until the fourth,fifth, and fifth levels were considered for RMCH, UBonn, and CHB-MITdatabases respectively. The levels of decomposition selected were dif-ferent as each database has a different sampling frequency. The EEGsub-bands were selected, ensuring different frequency ranges as itwould reveal information associated with that EEG band. The frequencyranges of approximation and detail coefficients in each level were givenin Table 1.2.5. Sigmoid entropyThe latest improvements in non-linear dynamics theory or chaostheory provided a new concept to analyze EEG time series due to itshigh versatility. It is a well-known fact that EEG contains nonlinearelements, which is a reflection of the neuronal activity in the brain. Thesigmoid function is one of the most widely used activation functions inneural networks. The advantage of this activation function is, unlike thelinear function is that its output is always in the range of 0 and 1.Therefore, we propose sigmoid entropy to analyze EEG time series databy exploiting the nonlinear characteristics of the sigmoid function.2.5.1.

Sigmoid entropy(4)The sigmoid function is used as a feature for epileptic seizure de-tection as it is widely used in the artificial neural networks as a non-linear complex function.

ClassificationThe classification of epileptic seizures was performed using the SVMclassifier as the good performance was reported in previous studies[12,24,25,34,48,59,60]. SVM uses kernel method to transform thefeature set that draws an optimal boundary between possible outputs[61]. The preliminary study reveals better performance using radialbasis function kernel and the same was implemented for further ana-lysis.In order to find the best wavelet and a decomposition level forseizure detection on the RMCH database, a segment-based and event-based classification approach was employed as reported in Ref. [17].S. Raghu, et al.Computers in Biology and Medicine 110 (2019) 127–143The optimal decomposition level and wavelet were identified from asegment-based approach employed for event-based classification ap-proach. The SVM classifier was implemented with leave-one-subject-outcross-validation method for the RMCH database.To evaluate the segment-based approach, we have used perfor-mance measures, namely sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F mea-sure [5,12,20]. F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.The recall is the same as sensitivity and precision is the positive pre-dictive value (PPV).Sensitivity=Specificity=TP+FNTPTNTN FP+Accuracy=TPFP++TNTN FN+TP+Fmeasure2= ⋅precision recallprecisionrecall⋅+PPV=TP+TPFPNPV=TNTN FN+(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)where, TP is true positive, FN false negative, TN is true negative and FPis false positive.Further, the performance of the event-based seizure detection on theRMCH database was evaluated using seizure detection rate (SDR), falsedetection rate (FDR) and mean detection delay (MDD) [50].(cid:129) SDR: Number of correctly detected epileptic seizure events(cid:129) FDR: Percentage of false seizure detections per hour(cid:129) MDD: Mean time difference between seizure occurrence and algo-rithm detectionSimilarly, UBonn database was evaluated using a segment-basedapproach with 10-fold cross-validation and the performance was as-sessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F measure.Further, PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to com-pare the results with existing methods (See Table 6) obtained usingUBonn database.Cohen's Kappa coefficient is a statistical method that measures be-tween two raters [62]. In our study, two raters were an epileptic seizureand normal EEG. Kappa determines if there is an agreement betweentwo raters by chance with a percentage. Table 2 shows cell probabilitiesfor two raters. The predictions A and B represent the epileptic seizureand normal EEG respectively. In other words, these predictions can beobtained from the confusion matrix.To compute Kappa, first, we need to calculate the observed level ofagreement (Po) and expected agreement (Pe), which is given by Ref.[62].Po=PBBPAA+PTPe⎜= ⎛⎝PAA+PTPAB*PAA+PTPBA⎟⎞⎠⎜+ ⎛⎝PAB+PTPBB*PBAPBB+PT⎟⎞⎠(19)(20)Table 2Calculation of Kappa values.Rater #2Rater #1Prediction of A ValuePrediction of B ValuePrediction of A ValuePAAPBAPrediction of B ValuePABPBB131where,PT=PAA+PAB+PBA+PBBFinally, the Kappa coefficient is calculated as [62].K=Po1−−PePe(21)(22)The Kappa is always less than or equal to 1. The Kappa coefficientwith a value of 1 implies perfect agreement and any value less than 1can be interpreted as follows: Poor agreement (<0.2), Fair agreement(0.2–0.4), Moderate agreement (0.4–0.6), Good agreement (0.6–0.8),and Very good agreement (0.8–1).2.7. Alarm for seizure detectionTawfik et al. [17] have proposed channel fusion based seizure de-tection by combining the results obtained from different channels todetermine the seizure onset. Similarly, Zandi et al. [46] have proposedseizure alarm method, when at least three different channel alarmsoccur within a duration of 5 s. Bogaarts et al. [6] have applied bothepochs based and event-based seizure classification. Their mechanismhelped to reduce the false alarm and improve the sensitivity.In our study, to improve the performance of the algorithm, post-processing of the SVM classifier in the event-based approach was em-ployed as reported in Refs. [6,17,46]. Fig. 4 depicts the procedure ofalarm for seizure detection. The channels were marked as seizure if atleast three channels classifier output was 1; otherwise, those channelswere marked as non-seizure. The reason behind choosing three chan-nels for the decision making was that a minimum of three channels wasassociated with seizures in case of focal seizures.3. Results3.1. Spectrogram analysisFig. 5 shows the EEG (channel T5) from the RMCH database and itsspectrogram analysis before and after pre-processing. Fig. 5a and cshows raw EEG and filtered EEG signal respectively. The line noise at50 Hz can be observed in Fig. 5b and spectrogram of filtered EEG areshown in Fig. 5d. Spectrogram analysis revealed that PSD during epi-leptic activity was found to be higher resulting in better discriminationas compared to the normal activity. Therefore, good discrimination interms of amplitude and PSD for epileptic activity was achieved. Theseinfluenced to derive the DWT based sigmoid entropy both in time andfrequency domains.3.2. Analysis of sigmoid entropy using synthetic signalWe explore the sigmoid entropy to observe the changes in EEGsignal under different conditions. A synthetic signal was created whichcomprises of three parts of 5 s duration each with different probabilitydensity functions [63]: (A) Gaussian distribution with zero mean andstandard deviation of 1, (B) normal EEG signal from channel T5, (C)epileptic EEG from channel T5. Fig. 6 shows the analysis of sigmoidentropy for the synthetic signal. The following were the facts derivedfrom the synthetic signal analysis:1 Entropy was less for Gaussian distribution and further less for epi-leptic EEG.2 Entropy was maximum for normal EEG.3 The transition from one distribution to another was clearly seen.3.3. Segment-based approach classification resultsThe segmentation length of 1 s was applied for feature extractionand seizure detection. The EEG signal was decomposed up to the fourthS.

During the preliminary visual marking and training phase of SVM, it was seen that the minimum duration ofseizure activities was found 6 s. Therefore, when the consecutive segments are marked as seizures for a minimum of 6 s, then it is considered as one seizure event. Thismechanism helped us to reduce the false detections that arise due to artifacts and non-epileptic activities.Fig. 5. An example of EEG (channel T5) from the RMCH database and its analysis.

Boxplot ana-lysis showed good discrimination in terms of median, quartile, upperquartile and interquartile range for all the wavelets.In order to find the best decomposition level and wavelet, we em-ployed the segment-based classification approach [6,17,46]. The op-timal decomposition level and wavelet obtained in segment-based ap-proaches were employed for event-based classification approach. Fig. 9shows the classification results achieved using the segment-based ap-proach. The sensitivity of 100% was seen in the D1 sub-band using Coif4, Dmey, Bior3.1, and Rbio3.1 wavelets. However, sensitivity obtainedin the D1 sub-band using Haar wavelet was very close to other wavelets.Further, again sensitivity of 100% was seen in the D2 sub-band usingHaar, Coif 4, Dmey, and Bior3.1 wavelets. The highest sensitivity of99.72% was achieved in the D3 sub-band using Dmey, Bio3.1 andRbio3.1 wavelets. Similarly, Dmey and Bio3.1 wavelets in D4 sub-bandsshowed 100% sensitivity. The maximum sensitivity of 99.97% seen inthe A4 sub-band using Dmey wavelet. The results showed that all thewavelets were capable of producing good sensitivity (i.e., seizure de-tection) using sigmoid entropy. The specificity of 100% was obtained inD2 (Rbio3.1), D3 (Haar, Coif4, and Bior3.1, and Rbio3.1), and D4(Haar, Coif4, and Bio3.1) sub-bands. The least sensitivity and specificityobtained was 92.28% in (Rbio3.1) and 86.34% in D1 (Dmey) respec-tively. The highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100% wasachieved using Bior3.1 wavelet in D4 sub-band.In Fig. 9, the last bar shows the F-measure for the same. The least F-133S.

Among all the sub-bands and wavelets, highestsensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F-measure of 100% was achievedusing Bior3.1 wavelet in D4 sub-band. Therefore, the segment-basedapproach showed that Bior3.1 wavelet in D4 sub-band is the optimalchoice for the event-based approach.3.4. Event-based approach classification resultsFor the event-based approach, Bior3.1 wavelet in D4 sub-band wasemployed as it showed superior performance (Section 3.3). Fig. 10presents EEG, sigmoid entropy in time and frequency domains andclassifier output corresponding to different channels of an epilepticpatient data obtained from RMCH database. According to the visualidentification of the EEG by experts, the seizure starts at 32 s and endsat 93 s. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 10, the seizure was detectedimmediately after the onset at 32 s (in F4, T3, and T5) and with somedelay in channels Cz and P3. On applying the proposed method to thecomplete epileptic data, which consist of 162 seizures, SDR of 96.34%along with the MDD of 1.2 s and FDR of 0.5/h was observed. Thus, theproposed method was capable of capturing the seizure onsets shortlyafter its occurrence reducing the detection delay. Nearly 60% of theseizure onsets across each channel were detected within 1 s, and re-maining were identified within 2 s.Fig. 10.

Results using UBonn databaseThe proposed method was applied to one of the gold standard EEGdatabase obtained from the UBonn [47] to evaluate the generalizationand efficiency of the algorithm. The sigmoid entropy feature extractedfrom the UBonn database was classified using the segment-based ap-proach with 10-fold cross-validation. Since the sampling frequency ofUBonn database was 173.71 Hz, EEG was decomposed up to the fifthlevel. For UBonn database, the following sub-bands were considered:D1 (fs/4-fs/2), D2 (fs/8-fs/4), D3 (fs/16-fs/8), D4 (fs/32-fs/16), D5 (fs/64-fs/32) and A5 (0-fs/64). The frequency content within the sub-bandsare as follows: 43.4–86.8 Hz, 21.7–43.4 Hz, 10.85–21.7, 5.42–10.85 Hz,2.70–5.43 and 0–2.70 Hz for D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and A5 respectively.Fig. 11a shows the classification results obtained for the UBonndatabase for the case {A}- {E}. The highest sensitivity of 99.28%(Rbio3.1), 99.83% (RBio3.1), 99.92% (Rbio3.1), 99.92% (all except forDmey), 100% (Coif4 and Bior3.1) in D1, D2, D3, D4, and A4 sub-bandswere obtained respectively. All the four performance measures showed100% in sub-band A5 using Haar and Rbio3.1 wavelets. One can ob-serve that results in D3, D4, and D5 sub-bands using all the waveletswere close to 100% except in Dmey wavelet. The results obtained in D1sub-band was less as compared to other wavelets except for Rbio3.1wavelet. Dmey wavelet in all the sub-bands except D1 showed poorperformance against other wavelets. The interesting fact observed was136S. Raghu, et al.Computers in Biology and Medicine 110 (2019) 127–143Fig. 11. (continued)that the performance measures achieved using Rbio3.1 wavelet in allthe bands were greater than 99.24%. Further, Bior3.1 wavelet showedsimilar results to Rbio3.1 wavelet in D3, D4, D5, and A5 sub-bands.Fig. 11b shows the results obtained for classification problem{ACD}-{E}. The highest classification accuracy of 95.61% was achievedusing Bio3.1 wavelet in sub-band D4. Further, Haar wavelet in sub-band D1, Coif4 in sub-band D3, Dmey in sub-band D3, and Rbio3.1 insub-band D1 showed the highest accuracy of 95.24%, 94.38%, 95.16%,and 95.21% respectively. The highest classification accuracy of 96.23%was obtained using Haar wavelet in sub-band D2 for classificationproblem {ABCD}-{E} (refer Fig. 11c). The 3-class classification problem{AB} -{CD}-{E} showed the highest accuracy of 90.89% using Rbio3.1wavelet in sub-band D2 (refer Fig. 11d).3.6. Results using CHB-MIT databaseThe proposed method was tested on one of the largest EEG databaseCHB-MIT [49] available in the open source. The classification metho-dology adopted for the RMCH database was applied to this databasealso. Fig. 12 shows the classification results obtained for CHB-MIT da-tabase. Good results were obtained in D1 to D4 sub-bands using all thewavelets. The highest accuracy of 88.48% (D3), 90.65% (D1), 90.78%137S.

The results are grouped wavelet wise for each sub-band.(D4), 91.53% (D1), and 94.38% (D1) was obtained using Haar, Coif4,Dmey, Bio3.1, and Rbio3.1 wavelets respectively. Among all the wa-velets, the highest sensitivity of 94.21% was obtained in sub-band D3using Rbio3.1 wavelet. The highest sensitivity of 100% was seen inmany sub-bands and wavelets. Notably, the classification results ob-tained using sub-bands D5 and A5 were less as compared to other sub-bands.UBonn and CHB-MIT databases exhibited higher sigmoid entropyfor normal EEG similar to the RMCH database. Hence, it shows thatsigmoid entropy performs fairly better on different databases exhibitinggood generalization for seizure detection.3.7. Analysis of Cohen's Kappa coefficientTable 3 shows the Kappa coefficient obtained from all the threedatabases.

Further, the Kappa coef-ficient of 1 was obtained for many sub-bands and wavelets for theUBonn database. The results obtained for class A-E are only reported inTable 3. Finally, the highest Kappa coefficient of 0.940 was achieved forRbio3.1 wavelet in sub-band D4 for the CHB-MIT database. Notably, theleast Kappa coefficients were obtained for CHB-MIT as compared to theRMCH and UBonn databases. Overall, the Kappa coefficients obtainedfrom all the databases belong to either good or very good agreementcategory.4. DiscussionThe primary aim of the proposed method was to enhance the SDR,FDR, and MDD for real-time seizure detection. In that context, a novelfeature referred to as sigmoid entropy using DWT in both time andfrequency domains was proposed and evaluated on three EEG data-bases.The seizure detection algorithm using weighted permutation en-tropy proposed in Ref. [17] reports a lower measure for epileptic sei-zure EEG as compared to normal EEG signal. Further, similar resultswere obtained in Ref. [18] using minimum variance modified fuzzyentropy. In resemblance to Refs. [17,18], sigmoid entropy measure alsoexhibited lesser entropy for epileptic EEG than normal EEG in ourstudy.4.1. Performance comparison with other entropy methodsforTable 4 shows the performance comparison of the studies that usethe classification ofseizures. The studiesentropy methods[5,10,12,19,20] have used a single database to test their proposed al-gorithm. Whereas, in the proposed study, three different databases havebeen studied to test the algorithm. It can be seen from Table 4 that theresults are shown by our study were better for the UBonn database.In order to compare the performance of the sigmoid entropy withother entropy methods, the three most widely used Shannon, Renyi,and Tsallis entropy were tested on all the three databases. An entropyindex of 2 was set for both Renyi entropy and Tsallis entropy [5].Different entropy was estimated using Bior3.1 wavelet in D4, Rbio3.1wavelet in A5, and Rbio3.1 in D3 sub-bands for the RMCH, UBonn, and138S.

On all the threedatabases, sigmoid entropy showed the highest classification results ascompared to other entropy methods (refer Fig. 13). Further, for UBonndatabase, sensitivity for Shannon and Renyi entropy was the same asour method, but not for other measures. However, the classificationresults of other entropy methods were very much close to the results ofsigmoid entropy.The seizure detection algorithm must be computationally efficientfor quick detection of seizure activity. Therefore, we ran the algorithmfor ten trials and mean time (s) was calculated that includes pre-processing (TP), DWT (TDWT), feature extraction (TFE) and classification(TCL) using SVM. The total computation time (CT) required to execute acomplete algorithm can be expressed as:CT s( )=TP+TDWT+TFE+TCL(23)The complete experiment was implemented in MATLAB 2017busing 8 GB RAM, CPU 2 GHz with an Intel I3 processor. The perfor-mance results may differ from machine to machine based on the systemconfiguration.Fig. 13 shows the computation time taken to execute the algorithmfor each entropy. The proposed sigmoid entropy displayed lesser com-putation time than other existing entropy methods for the RMCH(10.02 s), UBonn (24.52 s), and CHB-MIT (366.05 s) databases. Relativeperformance (RP) was used to compare the efficiency of the sigmoidentropy against other entropy measures [20]. It is defined as the ratio ofthe F measure to the computation time (s), and it can be expressed as:=RPFmeasureCT(24)The higher the RP better the performance of the algorithm. Fig. 13shows the RP obtained for four entropy methods. Sigmoid entropy ex-hibits slightly better performance as compared to the other three en-tropy methods for all the three databases. Hence, it confirms that sig-moid entropy is better and computationally efficient as compare toother entropy methods.Fig. 13.

Performance comparison using long term EEGTable 5 shows a comparison study with other existing methods. Thestudies considered for the comparison are based on the criteria that thealgorithms have used long-term multichannel EEG and reported SDR,FDR, and MDD. The proposed algorithm attained a good sensitivity of96.34%, which is comparable to Refs. [7,49] and higher than otherstudies reported in Table 5. Our method shows significant improvementin MDD (1.2 s), which is better than the results reported in Refs.[46,64–66]. The FDR of 0.5/h was achieved that was almost similar toother studies.4.3. Performance comparison using UBonn databaseWe have evaluated the generalization of our algorithm on UBonndatabase. Table 6 shows the performance comparison of the studiesconducted using UBonn database. The studies considered for the com-parison that have reported the performance measures, namely sensi-tivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV. Few studies have attainedlesser performance measures despite employing DWT with morenumber of features. Noticeably, the proposed method showed betterresults on all measures using DWT.Fig. 14 shows the performance comparison using radar chart for thestudies conducted using UBonn database that was reported in Table 6.In the radar chart, the best method spans a larger Pentagon. Our seizuredetection method exhibited the largest area (red pentagon in Fig. 14) ascompared to other studies.4.4. Significant findings of the studyThe significant findings of the study are listed below:1 This study introduced DWT based sigmoid entropy in time andfrequency domains that were derived from the sigmoid function forthe detection of epileptic seizures.2 The proposed algorithm was tested on three databases, namelyRMCH, UBonn, and CHB-MIT for its generalization and robustness.3 Five commonly used wavelets, namely Haar, Coif4, Dmey, Bior3.1,and RBio3.1, were examined and compared with different decom-position levels. Among five different wavelets, Bio3.1 in D4 sub-band, Rbio3.1, and Haar in A5 sub-band, Rbio3.1 in D3 sub-bandwas found to be the best choice for RMCH, UBonn, and CHB-MITdatabases respectively. Further, Dmey wavelet showed the leastperformance for UBonn database.4 The classification results obtained in D5 and A5 sub-bands usingCHB-MIT database was less as compared to other sub-bands.Fig. 14.

Limitations and future directionsDuring the simulation, it was observed that the bin ranges should beset properly during the probability estimation of the signal. Improperselection of such parameter leads to not a number or infinity in aMATLAB platform. As a future direction, the proposed algorithm will betested on more number of EEG recordings. Further, sigmoid entropywill be explored on EEG signals obtained for different conditions suchas detection of the level of alcohol, drowsiness detection, and an-esthesia depth level detection. In addition, a deep learning based ap-proach will be introduced to all the three databases.5. ConclusionIn this paper, a novel feature referred to as sigmoid entropy wasproposed for the detection of epileptic seizures in the EEG signals.Sigmoid entropy was estimated by decomposing the EEG signal usingDWT. Experimental results showed that sigmoid entropy was capable ofcapturing the transitions in the EEG that reflected the abnormal activityin the brain. The results showed that the sigmoid entropy value waslower for epileptic activity as compared to normal EEG. The best wa-velet and decomposition level (sub-band) was identified using fivewavelets. Among five different wavelets, Bio3.1 (sub-band D4), Rbio3.1and Haar (sub-band A5), and Rbio3.1 (sub-band) D3 was found to bethe best choice for the RMCH, UBonn, and CHB-MIT databases re-spectively. The classification results showed an SDR of 96.34%, MDD of1.2 s and FDR of 0.5/h for the RMCH database. Further, the highestsensitivity of 100% and 94.21% were obtained using UBonn and CHB-MIT databases respectively. Our experimental results conclude thatsigmoid entropy can be used to analyze the brain dynamics to under-stand the epileptic seizures behavior with less computational com-plexity.Conflicts of interestNone declared.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to doctors of the Institute of Neuroscience,Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals, Bengaluru, India, for valuablediscussion and providing EEG recordings for research purpose.
