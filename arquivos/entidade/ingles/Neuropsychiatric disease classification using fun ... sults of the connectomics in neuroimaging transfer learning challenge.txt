However, one key question remains: are we capturing biologicallyrelevant and generalizable information about the brain, or are we simplyoverfitting to the data? To answer this, we organized a scientific challenge,the Connectomics in NeuroImaging Transfer Learning Challenge (CNI-TLC),held in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. CNI-TLC included two classificationtasks: (1) diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)within a pre-adolescent cohort; and (2) transference of the ADHD modelto a related cohort of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients with anADHD comorbidity. In total, 240 resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) time seriesaveraged according to three standard parcellation atlases, along with clinicaldiagnosis, were released for training and validation (120 neurotypical controlsand 120 ADHD). We also provided Challenge participants with demographicinformation of age, sex, IQ, and handedness. The second set of 100 subjects(50 neurotypical controls, 25 ADHD, and 25 ASD with ADHD comorbidity)was used for testing. Classification methodologies were submitted in a stan-dardized format as containerized Docker images through ChRIS, an open-source image analysis platform. Utilizing an inclusive approach, we rankedthe methods based on 16 metrics: accuracy, area under the curve, F1-score,false discovery rate, false negative rate, false omission rate, false positiverate, geometric mean, informedness, markedness, Matthew’s correlation co-efficient, negative predictive value, optimized precision, precision, sensitivity,and specificity. The final rank was calculated using the rank product foreach participant across all measures. Furthermore, we assessed the calibra-tion curves of each methodology. Five participants submitted their method2for evaluation, with one outperforming all other methods in both ADHD andASD classification. However, further improvements are still needed to reachthe clinical translation of functional connectomics. We have kept the CNI-TLC open as a publicly available resource for developing and validating newclassification methodologies in the field of connectomics.Keywords: Functional Connectomics, Disease Classification, ADHD,Challenge1. IntroductionFunctional connectomics, or the study of whole-brain synchronizationmaps, has become of increasing interest to the neuroscientific community inrecent years. For example, functional connectomics has provided valuable in-sight into human cognition (Mill et al. (2017); Shine et al. (2016)), the system-level organization of the brain over development and aging (Somerville et al.(2018); Kaiser (2017)), and whole-brain functional alterations in disease orinjury (D’Souza et al. (2019); D’Souza et al. (2020); Venkataraman et al.(2012, 2013b, 2016, 2013a); Ktena et al. (2019); Bonkhoff et al. (2020)).Large, open-source initiatives, such as the Human Connectome Project (Es-sen et al. (2012)) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (Di Martinoet al. (2014)), have spurred the development of new and increasingly powerfulmachine learning strategies to capitalize on these resources.One popular goal in connectomics is to classify patients from controls.However, objective comparisons of these algorithms across studies can bechallenging, due to variations in image acquisition, preprocessing pipeline,and the specific cohort under consideration (Abraham et al. (2017); Per-vaiz et al. (2019)). Given these factors, the question of whether a proposedmodel is capturing biologically relevant and generalizable information aboutthe brain, or simply overfitting to the data, remains to be investigated. Inaddition to data inconsistencies, performance is assessed using a restrictedand non-standardized subset of evaluation metrics, further hindering com-parisons across studies (Maier-Hein et al. (2018)). Similar to other fields,scientific challenges provide a way to control for these issues and have beenconducted in various domains, such as image registration (Murphy et al.(2011)), lesion segmentation (Heimann et al. (2009); Menze et al. (2014);Mendrik et al. (2015); Commowick et al. (2018); Carass et al. (2017)), andestimation of clinical scores (Wolterink et al. (2016)).3The Connectomics in NeuroImaging Transfer Learning Challenge (CNI-TLC) described here tackles the issues of generalizability and clinical rel-evance of functional connectomes by leveraging unique resting-state func-tional MRI (rsfMRI) datasets of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Neurotypical Controls (NC).ADHD is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder characterized by inattention, hy-peractivity, and impulsivity that affects more than 6 million children world-wide (Hamed et al. (2015); Americal Psychiatric Association (2013)).Incontrast, ASD patients typically exhibit problems with social skills, commu-nication, and abnormal behavioral habits (Huerta and Lord (2012); Pelphreyet al. (2014); Dowell et al. (2009); McPartland et al. (2011); Americal Psy-chiatric Association (2013)). While the hallmark behavioral manifestationof ADHD and ASD cohorts differ dramatically, there is a significant comor-bidity between the two disorders (Leitner (2014)). Inspired by this finding,we have developed a challenge framework to investigate whether connetome-based features identified in ADHD patients can be transferred to an ASDpopulation for a classification task. Our Challenge setup thereby extendsthe conventional notion of “transfer learning”. As opposed to transferringa previously optimized model for re-training and testing on a new cohort,we propose to transfer and test the learned representation itself, without ad-ditional training. This allows us to test whether a robust symptomatologycan be learned for ADHD, and if so, whether it can also be extracted in aco-morbid population. Participants were asked to design an ADHD versusNC classification model using rsfMRI time series and demographic measuresfrom 100 and 20 examples of each class for training and validation, respec-tively. In Task I of the Challenge, we evaluated the classifiers on withheldADHD and NC data (25 examples of each class). In Task II of the Challenge,we assessed the classification performance of the ADHD model on ASD pa-tients, who have been diagnosed with an ADHD comorbidity (25 examples ofeach class). Our unique Challenge assesses both the ability of the method toextract functional connectivity patterns related to ADHD symptomatologyand how much of this information “transfers” across clinical domains with anoverlapping diagnosis. Evaluation was performed using 16 different metrics,while applying cross-validation on the test data, and participants were rankedrelative to one another. In this paper, we describe the Challenge data, organi-zation, and detailed evaluation. We also describe the methodology submittedby each participant and the corresponding experimental results.42. Materials and Methods2.1. Patient PopulationThe data used for CNI-TLC were amassed retrospectively across multiplestudies conducted by the Center for Neurodevelopmental and Imaging andResearch (CNIR) at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) in Baltimore, MD(see Appendix A for the list of study names and Johns Hopkins IRB approvalnumbers). The overall cohort includes 145 children diagnosed with ADHD,25 children with a primary diagnosis of ASD who also meet the diagnosticcriteria for ADHD, and 170 NC. All children are between 8-12 years of ageand are considered high-functioning based on having a full-scale IQ at orabove the normal range; the groups have been matched on age and full-scaleIQ. Detailed cohort characteristics are summarized in Table 1.Table 1: Cohort characterization. For each sample (Training, Validation, and Testing),Controls were matched to patients for all demographics available (p > 0.05).

Clinical AssessmentParticipants received an ADHD diagnosis if they met criteria for ADHDusing either the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents (DICA),Fourth Edition (Reich et al. (1997)) or the Kiddie Schedule for AffectiveDisorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) for School-Aged Children-Presentand Lifetime Version (Kaufman et al. (2000)), in addition to either (1) a t-score of 60 on the Inattentive or Hyperactive subscales of the Conners’ Parentor Teacher Rating Scales-Revised Long Version or the Conners-3 (Conners(2002, 2008)), or (2) a score of 2 on at least 6 items on the Inattentive orHyperactivity/Impulsivity scales of the ADHD Rating Scale-IV, Home orSchool Versions (DuPaul et al. (1998)). These tests are designed for children5at the age of 6-18 years and were administered by a trained psychologistin CNIR. No additional instructions were given to either the children orexaminers for the purposes of this challenge.Diagnostic criteria for ASD was assessed via two standard instruments:the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Version 2 (ADOS-2) (Gothamet al. (2007)) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Lordet al. (1994, 2012)). Similar to K-SADS, the ADOS-2 evaluation consists ofboth structured questions and unstructured narratives. ADOS-2 is used toquantify both socio-communication deficits, as well as repeated/repetitive be-haviors. Once again, ADOS-2 was administered by a trained psychologist inCNIR. In contrast, ADI-R is a written questionnaire for parents and/or care-givers about the child. ADI-R provides categorical results for three domains:language and communication, reciprocal social interactions, and repetitivebehaviors. The overall ASD diagnosis is based on the summed dimensionalscores for each battery.Inclusion in the NC group required not meeting criteria for any diagnosison the DICA or K-SADS, having scores below clinical cut-offs on the parentand teacher (when available) Conners’ and ADHD Rating Scales, as well ashaving no immediate family members diagnosed with ADHD or ASD.In addition to diagnosis, we provided four demographic variables to chal-lenge participants. These variables are age, sex, the Wechsler IntelligenceScale for Children (fourth or fifth editions) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient(FSIQ; Wechsler (2003)), and the Edinburgh Handedness index (Oldfield(1971)).2.3. Data Acquisition and PreprocessingThe rsfMRI data used in this challenge was acquired on a Philips 3TAchieva scanner housed in the F.M. Kirby Research Center for FunctionalBrain Imaging at KKI2. The acquisition protocol used a single shot, partiallyparallel gradient-recalled EPI sequence with TR/TE 2500/30ms, flip angle70◦, and voxel resolution 3.05 × 3.15 × 3mm3. The scan duration was either128 or 156 time samples. Children were instructed to relax with their eyesopen and focus on a central cross-hair, while remaining still for the durationof the scan. All participants completed a mock scanning session to habituateto the MRI environment.2http://www.kennedykrieger.org/kirby-research-center6Figure 1: Pipeline of extracting data from a brain parcellation, which was provided forchallenge participants.The rsfMRI data was preprocessed using an in-house pipeline developedby CNIR and implemented in SPM-12 (Friston et al. (2007)). The pipelineincluded slice timing correction, rigid body realignment, and normalizationto the EPI version of the MNI template. The time courses were temporallydetrended in order to remove gradual trends in the data. CompCorr (Behzadiet al. (2007)) was performed to estimate and remove spatially coherent noisefrom the white matter and ventricles, along with the linearly detrended ver-sions of the six rigid body realignment parameters and their first derivatives.From here, the data was spatially smoothed with a 6mm FWHM Gaussiankernel and bandpass filtered between 0.01-0.1 Hz. Finally, spike correctionwas performed using the AFNI package (Cox (1996)), as an alternative tomotion scrubbing.We released average region-wise time series data for the CNI-TL Chal-lenge, from which participants could compute both static and dynamic con-nectivity measures. These average signals were computed based on threestandard parcellations: (1) the AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002)),which consists of 90 cortical/subcortical regions and 26 cerebellar regions,(2) the Harvard-Oxford atlas (Desikan et al. (2006)), which consists of 110cerebral and cerebellar regions, and (3) the Craddock 200 atlas (Craddocket al. (2012)), which is a finer parcellation of 200 regions. The choice ofatlases enabled participants to analyze the rsfMRI data at multiple spatialscales. Fig. 1 illustrates our postprocessing workflow for a single parcellation.The mean time courses for each parcellation were aggregated into a singledata file for participants to use at their discretion.72.4. Challenge Design2.4.1. DataSubmissions to CNI-TLC were evaluated based on two classification tasks:Task I - Primary Classification of ADHD versus NC; and Task II - Transfer-ence Classification of ASD versus NC. The cohort was divided into training(100 ADHD, 100 NC), validation (20 ADHD, 20 NC) and testing datasets(Task I: 25 ADHD, 25 NC; Task II: 25 ASD, 25 NC). The training and val-idation datasets only consisted of ADHD and NC subjects, in fulfillment ofTask I, and was made available for participants to download via the chal-lenge website3. Training data was released in June 2019, and validation datafollowed thirty days later. Each dataset was organized into top directories,one for each subject. The subject directories included four .csv files, one con-taining the demographic variables, and a separate file for each parcellation.Testing datasets for both Task I and Task II (composed of NC, ADHD andASD patients with ADHD comorbidity) were not released to the public. Thepatient and NC cohorts were matched on age, sex, FSIQ, and handedness ineach of the three datasets.2.4.2. Submission InfrastructureParticipants were instructed to submit their trained models as Dockerimages4. Docker is an emerging Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS) product thatprovides a simple mechanism for bundling applications with all their requireddependencies in easily isolated components called containers. In this manner,Docker containerized applications can be executed on all the major com-puting platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows) with no additional softwarerequirements besides Docker itself. By using Docker containers as the de-ployment vector for the trained models, the problem of actually runningthese models on a single evaluation system was addressed.For our Challenge, participants were directed to clone a GitHub repos-itory5. This repository contained all the basic skeleton components forbuilding a Docker image solution. In addition to the Docker components,a dummy stub Python program, pl-cni challenge.py was provided asa launching point for a solution. Participants could either code directly3http://www.brainconnectivity.net4http://www.docker.com5https://github.com/aichung/pl-cni_challenge8into pl-cni challenge.py, import their existing code as a Python mod-ule, or include a suitably compiled executable that can be called using theos.system() function in Python.The repository itself was created by running a cookie-cutter templatecode6 that creates plug-ins for ChRIS7. The use of the ChRIS system had nosignificant impact on participants other than defining a standard commandline interface contract.All submissions were required to accept two positional arguments – aninputDirectory that would contain the data, and an outputDirectory thatwould store their model predictions. In addition, submitted solutions wereto expect the input directory to contain test data with the same folder struc-ture as the released training and validation data, with subject diagnosis in-formation excluded. Participants were instructed to write two text files intothe output directory: classification.txt containing binary classificationlabels for each subject, and score.txt containing the probability score ofeach corresponding label in classification.txt. Full instructions on howto create, compile and execute a compatible Docker image for submissionwere provided on the Challenge website. The Docker images were executedon each test subject, one at a time. For consistency, all submissions wereevaluated on the same machine.2.5. ParticipantsFive solutions were submitted before the deadline of the Challenge. Abrief summary of each method is given below. Additional details for eachmethod can be found in Appendix B.Submission 1 (S1). MeInternational. The method is based on build-ing classification pipelines by using permutations of functional connectivitymatrices, anatomical atlases, and classification algorithms (Abraham et al.(2017)). From each atlas and time series, correlation, covariance, partial cor-relation, precision, and tangent embedding for functional connectivity wereestimated. Classification was based on support vector machines (SVMs),linear regression (l1 or l2 regularization), random forest, k-nearest neighbor,and naive Bayes classifiers. Each combination was tested on the trainingdata and evaluated on the validation data set, where the best performingpipeline was chosen based on its prediction accuracy score.6https://github.com/FNNDSC/cookiecutter-chrisapp7https://chrisproject.org9Submission 2 (S2). HSE. The core principle of this submission wasthe utilization of eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian. In brief, for eachconnectome, the normalized Laplacian and its corresponding eigenvalues werecalculated. The full set of eigenvalues were subsequently used as features inan SVM classification algorithm using a polynomial kernel.Submission 3 (S3). ShefML. This solution consists of two stages: First,pairwise region of interest (ROI) features, ROI-to-ROI, were extracted fromthe rsfMRI time series by computing Tangent Pearson connectivity (Kundaet al. (2020)). Then, an SVM was trained which is regularized by the statisti-cal independence (Gretton et al. (2005)) between the classifier decision scoresand three types of demographic information: gender, age, and handednessscore (Zhou et al. (2020)).Submission 4 (S4). ShefML. In this approach, five types of featureswere extracted from the time series by computing: mean and standard de-viation, Pearson correlation, Tangent (Varoquaux et al. (2010a)), covariance(Varoquaux et al. (2010b)), and Tangent Pearson (Kunda et al. (2020)) con-nectivity. Subsequently, five classifiers (Zhou et al. (2020)), one per feature,were trained and classifications were combined by majority voting.Submission 5 (S5). YaleIPAG. Here, an LSTM-based (long short-termmemory) network was used to learn directly from time-series data (Dvorneket al. (2017)). Twenty-two AAL ROIs were first selected based on consis-tent connectivity differences between ADHD and controls in bootstrappedsamples. The time-series from these ROIs were input to an LSTM, with thedemographic data used in hidden and cell state initialization (Dvornek et al.(2018)).2.6. Evaluation and Ranking2.6.1. Challenge Evaluation MetricsTaking an inclusive approach, we assessed multiple measures commonlyused in classification tasks, such as accuracy and area under the curve (AUC),along with distributional measures, such as geometric-mean and optimizedprecision. This approach provides an intuitive and robust characterization ofeach submission. A full list of the utilized measures and their interpretationis given in Table 2, while a detailed description of these measures can befound elsewhere in the literature (Hossin and Sulaiman (2015)).10Table 2: Summary of evaluation metrics, including abbreviation (Abbr.) used, a shortdescription, and condition under which one participant outperforms another (‘Better if’).Abbr.

Comparison and Ranking StrategyWe first evaluated the model performances on the validation set to assessthe primary classification task of ADHD versus NC. This evaluation providesa baseline measure of performance for each algorithm on data that has beenmade available to the participants. It also allows us to investigate the dropin performance when presenting the classifier with unseen test data later on.We utilized a 5-fold cross-validation scheme for statistical testing of eachsubmission on the unseen data. Namely, we “randomly” divided our testingdataset into five equal sized, statistically indistinguishable (in terms of sex,age, FSIQ, and handedness), disjointed folds8 and calculated the evaluationmetrics (see Table 2), using data from four of the five folds. This processyields five quantitative values for each evaluation metric. The cross validationprocedure was repeated 100 times (on different random splits of the data),8https://github.com/mdschirmer/MDS;Schirmer et al. (2019)11resulting in a distribution of 500 values for each metric.Our initial ranking was based on the median of the distributions, wherethe ranking between participants was statistically evaluated using a pairwiseWilcoxon test. Considering the total of 320 tests (ten comparisons betweenchallengers with 16 measures each for two classification tasks, i.e., ADHDand ASD), we set the significance level to p ≤ 0.0001 (Bonferroni correctionof 0.05/320). Finally, we calculated the rank product (geometric mean) foreach participant, which gave us the final ranking of submissions.In addition, we evaluated submissions based on calibration curves. Withcalibration curves, we can gain an idea of the model’s behavior and confi-dence in performing the classification tasks. These curves assess if the modelcan reliably estimate the probability of the diagnosis by plotting the meanpredicted probability against the true probability for each user-specified prob-ability bin. Here, we summarize the results of the cross-validation approachas a single calibration curve using 10 bins of width 0.1, and fit a linear modelto the predicted probability against the observed probability for comparison.3. ResultsThe patient cohort utilized in this challenge was on average 10.42 yearsold, 70.3% male, with an average FSIQ of 111.3, and a handedness scoreof 0.7. Neurotypical controls in training, validation, and test data were notsignificantly different from their corresponding patient population in termsof sex, age, FSIQ, and handedness (all p > 0.05).The evaluation of the performance for all participants and datasets issummarized in Table 3. Using the validation set performance as a baselinefor the Primary Classification Task I (ADHD), we observed a large drop inperformance for participants S1, S3, and S4, across all metrics against thetest set. The performance of the methods submitted by participants S2 andS5, however, remained relatively stable. For the Transference ClassificationTask II (ASD with ADHD comorbidity), we see a further decrease in perfor-mance compared with Task I, across all metrics and for all participants.12Table 3: Summary of performance for each participant (S1 to S5) given as the median of each evaluation metric for validation,Task I, and Task II test datasets.13F1S1Acc0.75AUC 0.730.79FDR 0.32FNR 0.05FOR 0.08FPR 0.45GM 0.8Inf0.5Mark0.6MCC 0.55NPV 0.92OP29.73Pre0.68Sen0.95Spec0.55Task I - ADHDValidationS30.730.850.730.290.250.260.30.730.450.450.450.7428.970.710.750.7S20.530.620.560.480.40.470.550.560.050.050.050.5320.860.520.60.45S40.830.890.820.160.20.190.150.820.650.650.650.8132.970.840.80.85S50.680.720.680.330.30.320.350.680.350.350.350.6826.960.670.70.65S10.50.480.60.50.250.50.750.610.000.000.000.519.50.50.750.25S20.550.630.570.450.40.440.50.570.10.10.10.56220.550.60.5TestS30.530.540.510.480.50.480.50.510.050.050.050.5220.950.520.50.5S40.550.470.540.440.50.450.40.540.10.10.10.55220.560.50.6S50.680.660.70.330.30.30.350.70.350.360.350.726.960.670.70.65S10.450.450.550.540.30.620.80.56-0.1-0.16-0.130.3917.330.460.70.2Task II - ASDTestS30.450.430.430.550.60.540.50.43-0.1-0.1-0.10.46180.450.40.5S20.530.480.540.480.450.470.50.540.050.050.050.5320.860.520.550.5S40.430.410.410.580.60.580.550.41-0.15-0.15-0.150.4216.940.420.40.45S50.530.560.50.470.50.480.450.50.050.050.050.5220.860.530.50.55Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the distribution of each evaluation metric foreach participant’s model on Task I and Task II, respectively.

A good classification model is represented by a sigmoid or stepfunction. Generally, we observe an expected positive trend, where subjectswith higher probability scores are more likely to be ADHD patients in Task I(Figure 4A). For classifying ASD patients with ADHD comorbidity, mostmethodologies predominantly assigned higher probabilities to controls (Fig-ure 4B). Additionally, out of all submissions, three did not use the entirepredicted probability spectrum (S2, S3, S4), with a reversal in their linearfit between Task I and Task II.14Figure 2: Primary Classification Task I (ADHD versus NC) evaluation measure distribu-tions for each participant.

The CNI-TL Challenge was designed to probe the generalizabilityand clinical relevance of classification methodologies, which are now growing17in popularity for functional connectivity data.CNI-TLC combines two developmental disorders, ADHD and ASD, whichindividually have complex yet distinct behavioral phenotypes and diagnosticassessments. At the same time, the co-occurrence of these disorders is highwith many ASD children also exhibiting the stereotypical attention prob-lems and impulsivity of ADHD. In fact, connectomics studies have combinedASD and ADHD populations to disentangle their joint clinical presentations,with findings of both shared and distinct functional network features be-tween ADHD and ASD (Ray et al. (2014); Martino et al. (2013); Lake et al.(2019)). Our unique setup extends the conventional notion of “transfer learn-ing” to further probe this phenomenon. Rather than transferring just themodel architecture optimized for one cohort and re-training it on a secondcohort, we transfer the learned representations themselves. In this manner,we test whether a robust symptomatology can be learned for ADHD, andif so, whether it can also be extracted in a co-morbid population. Further-more, our Challenge setup is in line with recent trends in computationalneuroscience to develop methods that learn from multiple populations, so asto increase their clinical relevance (Douw et al. (2019)).4.1. Primary Classification Task I - ADHD versus NCNo method performed best nor worst on all metrics as shown in Table 4.However, in three out of five submissions, we observed a significant drop inperformance between validation and test data, whereas methods S2 and S5were able to retain their performance. A drop when moving from seen tounseen data in the evaluated metrics is to be expected, however, consideringthe even split between patients and controls, many of the methods general-ized to near-chance classification accuracy. Furthermore, the validation andtest datasets were matched to the training data on all phenotypic variables.Hence, Table 4 suggests an overfitting to the released data.Erring on the side of caution, frameworks intended for use in the clinicwill often prefer to optimize on FDR (type I error) and FNR (type II error),instead of aiming to perform unilaterily well in all the presented metrics. If wewere to assess performance by this criteria, Table 3 shows S5 outperformingother methods on the unseen ADHD test data (average of FDR and FNR:S1: 0.38; S2: 0.43; S3: 0.49; S4: 0.47; S5: 0.32). While S5 demonstratesthe best average value, a FDR and FNR of 0.3 can still be seen as too high,where 30% of the patients and controls are misclassified.18We can further differentiate the methodologies based on the results ofthe calibration curves. Three out of five classifiers (S2, S3 and S4) produceda very narrow range of probabilities for classification (around 0.5 ± 0.1),whereas the two remaining classifiers utilized (almost) the full probabilityspectrum. Not utilizing the full predicted probability spectrum may reflectthe models’ uncertainty in classification and could potentially lead to mis-classification in case of “noise” in the data. Thus, S5 demonstrated theoverall best performance on unseen data. Furthermore, the calibration curvefor S5 vaguely resembles a sigmoidal shape with an inflection point arounda predicted probability of 0.6.4.2. Transference Classification Task II - ASD with ADHD Comorbidity ver-sus NCOnly one method (S5) exhibited the correct trend of predicted probabil-ities in classifying ASD patients with ADHD comorbidity (Figure 4B). Allother methodologies predominantly assigned a higher probability of diseasefor NC, than for ASD patients. This may highlight the difficulties of achiev-ing generalizability in these models if other comorbidities are present, andfurther agrees with our quantitative ranking of methodologies.Overall, the large decrease in performances between Task I and Task II(Table 3), along with differences in the calibration curves (Figure 4) have twolikely explanations. First, the models are overfitting to the released datasets.Second, the predictive rsfMRI features learned for ADHD do not transferonto the ASD cohort with an ADHD co-morbidity, either because the latterhas a unique neural phenotype, or because the commonalities between thedisorders are overwhelmed by other signatures in the rsfMRI data, which didnot allow the extraction of biologically meaningful information that could bespecific to ADHD.4.3. Approaches and Considerations for Future ChallengersWhile we cannot state unequivocally one submission that performed thebest across all evaluation metrics in both Tasks (see Table 3), we can draw in-ferences from our submissions that may help to improve future developmentsof connectomic classification methodologies.Connectivity matrix estimation varies across rsfMRI connectome stud-ies and has been shown to affect classification performance (Abraham et al.(2017)). This lack of consensus in the field is reflected in our submissions- with each method using a different type of connectome as input. The19same observation can be made for choice of atlas, which can also influenceperformance (Abraham et al. (2017)). Interestingly, none of the CNI-TLCsubmissions used traditional graph metrics (Rubinov and Sporns (2010)),such as node degree, centrality, and small-worldness, which are ubiquitous infunctional connectivity literature. Given that machine-/deep-learning meth-ods can utilize big data during training, utilizing connectome data ‘as is’seems intuitive, and it may be that traditional graph metrics are not favoredfor collapsing the number of data points in a time series. Even so, there maybe advantages to including metrics that characterize complex global andtopological properties unique to brain networks which may not be directlyinterpreted from raw connectivity matrices or timeseries data.Despite the growing popularity of deep-learning methods, only one sub-mission used an end-to-end deep-learning framework. Instead, the most com-mon classifier among Challenge submissions was the support vector machine(Cortes and Vapnik (1995)). Ultimately, the deep-learning approach (S5)had the highest overall rank. Part of the reason may be attributed to aninitial feature selection being performed and using only the most discrimi-native connections as input to the classifier. In addition, they employed adynamic model that can capture key temporal information in the rsfMRIsignal. The second place submission on classification Task I, in contrast toothers, relied on the normalized graph Laplacian (S2). The graph Laplacianand its eigenspectrum enable a mapping of discrete data (a network) intovector spaces and manifolds, and their advantages have been greatly investi-gated, e.g., in fields such as clustering (Chung (1997)). This form of networkrepresentation has also found its way into connectomes and may have poten-tial to capture further discriminative information (Abdelnour et al. (2014);Chung et al. (2016b,a); Schirmer and Chung (2019)). These data filteringor manipulation techniques are effective for their robustness to overfitting(Du et al. (2018)) and may be a reason for S5 and S2 achieving the bestgeneralization performance from Task I to Task II.We also observed that not all available information was utilized by par-ticipants. While the winning algorithm pre-selected the most discriminatingfeatures, this approach could be extended to feature selection across multipleatlases. This observation highlights the importance of including prior knowl-edge in developing classifiers for clinical tasks. Generally, we observed thatmost of the classifiers did not cover the full predicted probability spectrum.While this calibration may not be directly related to a classifier’s perfor-mance on the actual task, it can serve as a proxy for assessing whether an20algorithm is extracting meaningful information from the data and can revealissues in the classification process.Another option for future challenges is the pooling of all classificationresults to asses their performance as an aggregate entity. As participantswere asked to output classification scores, we combined all methodologiespost hoc by obtaining their collective average, median, and maximum confi-dence (from the predicted value that is furthest away from 0.5), see AppendixC, Table C.5). Subsequently, if a consensus vote outperforms the individualmethodologies, secondary analyses are required to fully understand the im-plications.4.4. Challenge ContributionsThe data used for this Challenge represents one of the largest collectionsof rsfMRI data acquired at a single site for three different cohorts (ADHD,ASD, and NC). The data was carefully and consistently collected on a singlescanner model (Philips Achieva) by researchers at KKI. The in-house pre-processing pipeline is also standard in the field and included intermediatemanual checks for data quality.As part of our aim was to investigate the classification performance ofseveral methodologies, we chose to release data that was uniformly processedby a single pipeline that has been previously published (see Muschelli et al.(2014); Nebel et al. (2016); Stoodley et al. (2017)). The effect of rsfMRIprocessing decisions on analysis is a large and important issue to address thatis beyond the scope of our Challenge, but has been investigated by others (seee.g. Bowring et al. (2019); V´ytvarov´a et al. (2017); Vergara et al. (2017)). Wenote that a subset of the rsfMRI data has been released through ABIDE (DiMartino et al. (2013)) and ADHD-2009. However, we were careful to ensurethat the testing set contained only private data that had never been releasedand, as only pre-trained models were accepted, none of the algorithms wereretrained with access to the test data. Each of our training, validation, andtesting datasets were matched on demographic variables, in order to removeextraneous confounds. Finally, we opted to release the average time seriesfrom the rsfMRI data, rather than static or dynamic connectivity matrices,to provide more flexibility for participants. Likewise, we used three popularatlases to provide a range of spatial resolutions.9http://fcon 1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/results.html21In order to standardize our evaluation, we implemented a novel frame-work for participants to submit pre-trained models as Docker images. Theresulting Docker image from our framework also doubles as a plug-in com-patible with the ChRIS platform10, a pervasively open source framework thatutilizes cloud technologies to democratize medical analytics application de-velopment. ChRIS allows researchers the ability to simply deploy the sameapplication they have already developed in a cloud infrastructure with ac-cess to more data, more computational resources, and more collaboration todrive medical innovation, while standardizing healthcare application devel-opment. Subsequently, our approach gives participants the option to sharetheir pre-trained model with the wider medical imaging research community.One novel aspect of our Challenge, in comparison to current practices, isthe large array of evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of eachalgorithm. This decision was motivated by a lack of consensus in the fieldabout which metric is the “best” for evaluation, as it can be seen through theplethora of assessment metrics (Hossin and Sulaiman (2015)). Importantly,each metric assesses different aspects of an algorithm’s performance. Anotherkey strength of our evaluation procedure is that the test data is kept private.The unseen test data allows us to probe model overfitting and provides anobjective comparison between algorithms.With the above contributions, CNI-TLC has maintained and followedguidelines specifically outlined for challenges advocated by MICCAI with theintention of upholding transparency and fairness (Maier-Hein et al. (2018)).4.5. Future WorkOne of the main takeaways of our CNI-TL Challenge is that significantimprovements are necessary in order to translate functional connectivity intoclinical practice. Considering the performance across all participants sum-marized in Table 4, the overall scores are relatively low, with even the bestresults on the ASD cohort closely resembling chance in most metrics.The CNI-TL Challenge highlights some important recommendations forfuture work on classification using functional connectivity. For example, ourChallenge demonstrates the well-known issue of model generalizability tounseen data. This result supports the general recommendation that the datashould be split into training, validation, and testing sets, with the testing10https://chrisproject.org22set evaluated only once at the end of the study. Accordingly, we withheldthe test set from CNI-TLC participants and continue to do so from thepublic, allowing the continuation of the Challenge, while methodologies canbe further evaluated through the ChRIS platform.By pooling submissions to solve the same problem, our Challenge hasdemonstrated the diversity and creativity of methods developed to use func-tional connectomes for classification. With specifics to model- and neuralnetwork-based methods, CNI-TLC further highlighted the need for a consen-sus on a series of experimental design tests to understand the influence ofdata representation (i.e. matrix estimation type, atlas, thresholding) in rela-tion to an approach, disease, or dataset. Given the huge effort in recent yearsto amass and coalesce data from multiple sites, perhaps a similar ethos ofcombining and sharing efforts and approaches is equally necessary to tacklethe neuroimaging challenges of today.In recognition of the above points and of the role that challenges play inthe field, we will keep the CNI-TL Challenge available and online for scientiststo continually test their approaches. Submission is open to everyone, whetheror not they have participated in the Challenge. Specifically, we provide awebsite11 for developers of new methods to upload new solutions as ChRISplug-ins, with an automated evaluation infrastructure “behind the scenes”offering dynamic feedback on the performance of their model on the test set.Importantly, the test data used is not exposed, thus providing a fair baselinefrom which to measure comparative performance.5. ConclusionThe CNI-TL Challenge is an important step in the field of connectomics.First, it demonstrates the necessity of objective evaluation to assess general-izability to unseen data. Second, it goes beyond a single task-optimizationsetting to address the key question of whether we are capturing biologicallymeaningful phenomena. Here, we showed that the classification performanceof all methods dropped nearly to chance on a patient population with thetarget disease as a comorbidity. This result underscores the need for fur-ther work to reach clinical translation of functional connectomics for dis-ease identification. With the training and validation data remaining publicly11https://fnndsc.childrens.harvard.edu/cnichallenge23available, and the test data accessible through an online evaluation platform,CNI-TLC facilitates continual development of new classification methods forconnectomics.Acknowledgements and DisclaimersOrganizers:M.

Irzan, M. H¨utel, S. Ourselin, N. Marlow, A. MelbourneThe team evaluated different pipelines to select the best combination offunctional connectivity metrics, atlases and classification algorithms based on25prediction accuracy. The nodes of the functional connectome are the individ-ual atlas defined ROIs. The authors utilized the three different anatomicalbrain atlases (Craddock200 with 200 ROIs, Harvard Oxford with 110 ROIs,and AAL with 116 ROIs) and examined correlation, covariance, partial cor-relation, precision, and tangent embedding as metrics for functional connec-tivity. The team investigated l1 and l2 norm SVMs, linear regression witheither l1 or l2 regularization, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and naiveBayes classifiers as classification algorithms. Pipelines were built by usingpermutations of functional connectivity matrices, anatomical atlas, and clas-sification algorithms as inAbraham et al. (2017). The performance of eachpipeline was evaluated based on its prediction accuracy score on the valida-tion set. Figure B.5 shows the main steps of the methodology. The bestperformance was achieved using the AAL atlas, correlation metric, and SVMwith l2 regularization and penalty parameter of the error term C = 3−5, ashighlighted in red in Figure B.5.Figure B.5: Classification pipeline.In step 1, time series are produced by extractingthe mean time courses of the preprocessed rs-fMRI using three anatomical atlases (Crad-dock200, Harvard Oxford, and AAL). These were provided as part of the challenge. Instep 2, the time series are transformed into functional connectomes by using five matrixestimation methods. The functional connectomes are employed to perform supervisedlearning task with seven classifiers in step 3 and perform class prediction in step 4. Thepipeline highlighted in red demonstrated the best classification accuracy on the test set.26Submission 2 (S2) - HSE - Classification of ADHD disorder Against HealthyBased on the Spectra of Normalized LaplaciansTeam: E. LevchenkoThe resting state time-varying signals of the rsfMRI data can be con-sidered as a graph (connectome) (Sporns (2011)). Here, for each subject, acorrelation matrix Wij was calculated between each pair of ROIs i and j,using the Pearson correlation coefficient. First, the main diagonal in W andall negative values Wij < 0 were set to zero, i.e. the graph was reduced toits positive weight subgraph (see e.g.Chung and Schirmer (2019)).Graph theoretical studies have widely utilized the normalized Laplacianto characterize networks (see e.g.Chung and Graham (1997); Chung et al.(2016b)). The normalized Laplacian matrix L is defined asL = D−1/2(D − W )D−1/2,(B.1)where each node in diagonal matrix D is given as di = Pj Aij. The nor-malized Laplacian has several useful properties - one of them being that theeigenvalues are between 0 to 2 (Chung and Graham (1997)).In this challenge, rsfMRI time series data were provided based on multipleatlases with different sizes for each subject. Here, the normalized LaplacianL was calculated for each subject and atlas independently. The distributionsof eigenvalues of matrix L for each atlas were concatenated into one featurevector of length 426 for each subject. This feature vector serves as input forthe classification problem, which was addressed using an SVM algorithm witha polynomial kernel. The hyperparameters were optimized on the providedtraining set and the classification accuracy was obtained on the validationset using 10-fold cross-validation.Submission 3 (S3) - ShefML - Domain Independent SVM for CNI ChallengeTeam: S. Zhou, M. Kunda, H. LuThis solution learns a model via a two-stage pipeline: feature extractionand classifier training. For the feature extraction stage, Tangent Pearson(TP) (Kunda et al. (2020)) is applied to extract features from resting-statetime-series of the AAL atlas. Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. B.6, Pearsoncorrelation of the ROI-to-ROI relationship for each subject is computed first.Then tangent correlation analysis (Varoquaux et al. (2010a)) is performedto learn the group-level features of the brain network correlations, i.e. the27Figure B.6: Extracting Tangent Pearson connectivity features from resting-state fMRItime-series.connectivity of connectives. Additionally, the mean and standard deviationof each time series are concatenated to the TP features.For classification, it is assumed that the decisions (patient or control)made by a classifier should be independent to subjects’ information, such asgender and age, and therefore Side Information Dependence Regularization(SIDeR) learning framework (Zhou et al. (2020)) is used to leverage thesubjects’ phenotype information for model training. The learning frameworkis given byminfL(f (Xl), Y)}{z|Empirical risk+σkf k2K| {z }Model complexity+λρ(f (X), D)}{z|Side information dependence,(B.2)where ρ(·, ·) denotes a statistical independence metric, σ and λ are hyper-parameters, Xl, Y, X, D denote the labelled instances, training labels, allavailable instances, and side (phenotypic) information, respectively.Three kinds of subject side information (gender, age, and handiness score)are selected and encoded as the matrix D, where gender is encoded as 1(male) and −1 (female), and the age and handedness scores are normalizedto zero mean and unit variance. Empirically, Hinge (SVM) loss, ℓ2 norm,and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC;Gretton et al. (2005))are employed for L(·, ·), kf k2K, and ρ(·, ·), respectively. Therefore, the clas-sification algorithm is a semi-supervised SVM trained on the labelled data,with the coefficients regularised by the HSIC between the classifier decisionscores and subject phenotypic information.Submission 4 (S4) - ShefML - Ensemble Model for CNI ChallengeTeam: S. Zhou, M. Kunda, H. Lu28This approach contains three steps of analysis: feature extraction, classi-fier training, and ensemble. In the first step, five different type of featuresare extracted via computing the mean and standard deviation, Pearson cor-relation, tangent (Varoquaux et al. (2010a)), covariance (Varoquaux et al.(2010b)), and tangent Pearson correlation (Kunda et al. (2020)) from thefMRI time-series data of the AAL atlas. In the second step, five classifiersare trained on each type of feature extracted in step one respectively. Thetechnical details here are exactly the same as in the classification methodof S3 (see section Appendix B - Submission 3), which can be viewed as analternative approach of this solution. In the last ensemble step, the final pre-dictions are made by summarising the predictions given by the five classifiersfrom step two via majority voting. The pipeline is summarized in FigureB.7.Figure B.7: The learning pipeline of Submission 4. Multiple features based on varyingdefinitions of connectome creation were utilized in individual classifiers. Individual pre-dictions were merged using majority voting.Submission 5 (S5) - YaleIPAG - Learning Generalizable Recurrent NeuralNetworks from Small Task-fMRI DatasetsTeam: N.C. Dvornek, J. ZhuangThe method (Fig. B.8) is based on Dvornek et al. (2018), which aimsto learn generalizeable recurrent neural networks from small fMRI datasets.An LSTM-based network learns directly from the ROI time-series data, while29the demographic data is incorporated through subject-specific initializationof the LSTM hidden and cell states.Using the AAL atlas, ROI selection was first performed by keeping ROIswhose connectivity (i.e., correlation) was consistently significantly differentbetween ADHD and controls groups (two-sample t-test, p < 0.05) in 500random subsamples of the data, using 90% of the training subjects in eachsubsample. Connectivity was considered consistently different if the p-valuewas in the top 2% of smallest p-values in each of the 500 subsamples. Thisprocess resulted in 22 ROIs.The network architecture consisted of an LSTM layer with M = 32 hiddenunits and T = 24 timesteps (60s window), whose outputs were sent to ashared (across time) fully-connected layer with 1 node, followed by meanpooling and a sigmoid activation function to give the probability of ADHD.Time-series data from the 22 ROIs was used as input to the LSTM (Dvorneket al. (2017)), while demographic data was used for LSTM state initialization(Dvornek et al. (2018)). Specifically, demographic data was input to twofully-connected layers with M nodes each, representing the initial hiddenand cell state of the LSTM.To improve robustness, 10 models were trained using 10-fold cross-validationsplits of the training dataset, with the validation dataset used to determinewhen to stop training. To predict on a new subject, all possible 60s windowsof the time-series were input to the models to get a binary ADHD/controlprediction for each window. The subject-level probability of ADHD for a sin-gle model was the proportion of windows labeled as ADHD for that model.Finally, the probability of ADHD for a given subject was computed as themean of the 10 models’ predictions.Appendix C.An example of pooling the performance from all Teams into an aggregatescore by computing the average, median and maximum confidence of metricsacross all classifiers. The maximum confidence was calculated by picking theclassification where the predicted score is furthest away from 0.5, reflectingthe confidence of an algorithm in its classification.ReferencesAbdelnour, F., Voss, H.U., Raj, A., 2014. Network diffusion accurately mod-els the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity30Figure B.8: Pipeline overview. A. Top AAL ROIs with pairwise correlations were selectedwhich consistently differed between ADHD/NC using t-tests and repeated subject sub-sampling (90%). B. Ten LSTM models were trained using 10-fold split with top ROIs asinput. C. Prediction of each subject using all 60s windows and model ensembles.Table C.5: Consensus voting results of the challenge summarized as the median of eachevaluation metric. All participants scores were combined using the mean (avg), median,and maximum confidence (maxconf, defined as classification based on the score furthestaway from 0.5). In addition, the ”Best median metric” out of all submissions from Table 4)is provided for comparison. The consensus vote does not outperform the best medianmetric in the ADHD cohort, while performing close to chance in the ASD classificationtask.AccAUCF1FDRFNRFORFPRGMInf.MarkMCCNPVOPPreSenSpecavg0.350.630.320.670.700.650.650.33-0.30-0.30-0.300.3513.860.330.300.35maxconf0.480.570.480.520.500.520.500.48-0.05-0.05-0.050.4818.950.480.500.50ADHDmedian0.350.650.320.670.650.650.650.33-0.30-0.30-0.300.3513.860.330.300.35Best median metric0.660.680.700.330.300.300.350.700.350.360.360.7026.960.670.750.65avg0.500.510.510.500.500.500.500.510.000.000.000.5020.000.500.500.50maxconf0.550.440.530.460.500.460.450.530.100.100.100.5421.820.550.500.55ASDmedian0.500.540.520.500.450.500.550.530.000.000.000.5019.900.500.550.45Best median metric0.550.560.550.470.300.470.450.560.050.050.050.5320.860.530.700.55networks.
