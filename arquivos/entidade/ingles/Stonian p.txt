Introduction−, RT−This paper gives an algebraic representation of the subtheories RTEC , and RT of Asherand Vieu’s first-order ontology of mereotopology RT0. It corrects and extends previous workon the representation of these mereotopologies. We develop the theory of p-ortholattices– lattices that are both orthocomplemented and pseudocomplemented – and show thattogether with the Stone identity (x · y)∗ = xor equivalent definitions the naturalclass of Stonian p-ortholattices can be defined. The main contribution of the paper consistsas Stonian p-ortholattices. Moreover, it is shown thatof a representation theorem for RT−the class of models of RTEC is isomorphic to the non-distributive Stonian p-ortholatticesand a characterization of RT is given by a set of four algebras of which one need tobe a subalgebra of the present lattice model. As corollary we obtain that Axiom (A11)– existence of two externally connected regions – is in fact a theorem of the remainingaxioms of RT.∗ + y−∗© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Within AI and in particular Knowledge Representation (KR), region-based theories of space have been a prominent areaof research in the recent years. Traditionally, space has been considered in mathematics as point-based theories such asgeometric (e.g. Euclidean geometry) or topological representations (point-set topology) of space. Points are somewhat trickyto define and are far from intuitive in real-world applications. Instead, point-free theories of space such as region-basedtheories can be used to represent space in the context of (qualitative) spatial reasoning. Using regions instead of pointsas smallest units accounts more naturally for how humans conceptualize our physical world. Such commonsense spatialreasoning reflects rigid bodies or spatial regions more naturally than conventional, point-based models [19,27]. Since theearliest work of de Laguna [12] and Whitehead [30], mereotopology has been considered for building point-free theoriesof space. In AI, these theories are of importance for qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR): they focus on simple propertiesthat abstract from quantitative measurements while still being powerful enough to reason about spatial configurations andextract useful spatial knowledge, e.g. about bordering regions, intersecting regions, or the composition of regions. For anoverview of mereotopology within QSR we refer to [10].Broadly speaking, mereotopology is a composition of topological (from Greek topos, “place”) notions of connectednesswith mereological (from Greek méros, “part”) notions of parthood. Neither topology nor mereology are by themselves pow-erful enough to express part-whole relations.✩The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: torsten@cs.toronto.edu (T.

Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–14401425Topology can also be seen as a theory of wholeness, but has no means of expressing parthood relations. Connection doesnot imply a parthood relation between two individuals, as well as disconnection does not prevent parthood. Just considerthe example of countries – there exist many countries, e.g. the United States, that are not self-connected. Alaska should beconsidered part of the United States but is by no intuitive means connected to the other states. The same applies for Hawaii,although the kind of separation is different here: Alaska is separated by Canada from the continental US, whereas Hawaiiis solely separated by the Pacific ocean. If we consider landmass only, then Alaska and the continental US are part of aself-connected individual, namely continental North America, whereas Hawaii is separated from this landmass. On the otherhand, mereology is not powerful enough to reason about connectedness. As the previous example shows, two individualsbeing part of a common individual does not imply that this sum is self-connected. Hence, parthood is not sufficient tomodel connectedness.Consequently, to be able to reason about self-connected individuals, ways to combine mereology with topology arenecessary. Previously, Casati and Varzi [6] classified mereotopologies by how the two independent theories are merged.Other systematic treatments of mereotopology can be found in [11,16].One of the ways of building mereotopology studied in [30] takes topology as basis and defines mereology on top ofit reusing the topological primitive, thereby assuming a greater generality of topology than mereology. Clarke choose thisapproach for his seminal work in [7,8], and many later works in AI used Clarke’s work as starting point, e.g. the system RT0of Asher and Vieu [1], the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [2,9,19,25], Gotts theory [18], and Pratt and Schoop’s polygonalmereotopology [24]. Due to the same origin all of these theories use a single primitive of connectedness (or contact)and express parthood in terms of connection, thus limiting the mereotopology to the expressiveness of the connectionprimitive.Most mereotopologies are described in terms of first-order axioms. However, many of them lack soundness and com-pleteness proofs. But even soundness and completeness proofs are insufficient, instead we aim for representation theoremsup to isomorphism (“full duality” in the tradition of Stone’s representation theorem of Boolean algebras [28], see also e.g.[13,14,26,29]) that describe the models in a uniform, mathematically well-understood formalism. Among others, for theRCC [9,25] and the framework of Pratt and Schoop [24], which is limited to planar polygonal mereotopology, there existformal proofs that actually give insight into the possible models. But to better understand the relation between differentmereotopologies, we need to identify the models of each mereotopology and compare them to each other. Algebraic conceptsand relation algebras in particular provide a mathematical sound foundation for comparing various mereotopological theo-ries. Most previous work in this direction focused on the RCC, generalizations and algebraic and topological representationsthereof. Clarke’s theory has also been characterized in terms of algebras, see [3]. Another approach relates mereotopologieswith certain lattice structures. In particular, Stell shows in [27] that models of the RCC are isomorphic to so-called Booleanconnection algebras (or Boolean contact algebras), i.e. Boolean algebras together with a binary contact relation C satisfyingcertain axioms. Since lattices and Boolean algebras in particular are well-known mathematical structures, this approach ledto an intensive study of the properties of the RCC including several topological representation theorems [13–15,26,29]. Inthis paper we want to apply a similar method to the mereotopology RT0 of Asher and Vieu [1]. We will show that the sub-−EC andtheory RTRT in terms of algebraic properties. This relationship between models of RT0 and certain lattices is the main contribution ofthis paper. It can be seen as the start of a lattice-theoretic treatment of RT0 in a similar way as [27]. The next step in thisendeavor can be found in [31]. Another interesting result is Corollary 7.3 showing that the original axiom system in [1] isnot independent.can be expressed by a certain class of lattices. Subsequently, we investigate the additional axioms of RT−Compared to the RCC, the system of Asher and Vieu [1] focuses on a larger set of regions. The standard models of RCCare made of regular closed sets only whereas the standard models of RT0 contain regions with regular closed closures andregular open interiors. Therefore, the system RT0 can be seen as a more general approach in the following sense. The closedelements in Asher and Vieu’s theory correspond to the elements in RCC. It is, therefore, not very surprising that RT0 doesnot provide the same algebraic structure as RCC models, i.e. Boolean algebras. Even though we will consider distributivity inSection 6 this is a very particular case. By requiring this property one basically forces the more general elements of Asherand Vieu, i.e. open, closed and other sets, into the framework of regular closed regions. It turns out that in this – and justin this – case the contact relation collapses to overlap similar to Clarke’s original system. A more detailed study of therelationship between RCC models and the current framework via the skeleton can be found in [31].2. The mereotopology RT 0The mereotopology RT0 proposed by Asher and Vieu [1] evolved from Clarke’s theory, addressing some of its shortcom-ings. RT0 follows the strategy “Topology as Basis for Mereology” for defining mereotopology and hence does not contain anexplicit mereology. Consequently, the parthood relation P is sufficiently defined by the extension of the primitive relation C ,which limits the expressiveness of the whole theory to that of C . As a indirect consequence of our work, it will turn outthat we could express the whole theory also only in terms of the partial order of the lattice representation which amountsto specifying the relations P and O to describe a unique model.1426T. Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–14402.1. The first-order theoryFig. 1. RT0 and its subtheories.The first-order theory RT0 of Asher and Vieu [1] is based on a binary contact relation C as primitive. The followingaxioms (and definitions) define the theory RT0:(A1) ∀x[C(x, x)] (C reflexive)(A2) ∀x, y[C(x, y) → C( y, x)] (C symmetric)(A3) ∀x, y[∀z(C(z, x) ↔ C(z, y)) → x = y] (C extensional)(A4) ∃x∀ y[C(x, y)] (Existence of a unique universally connected element 1)(A5) ∀x, y∃z∀u[C(u, z) ↔ (C(u, x) ∨ C(u, y))] (Existence of a unique sum x ∪ y for every x and y)(D1) P (x, y) ≡def ∀z[C(z, x) → C(z, y)] (Parthood)(D3) O (x, y) ≡def ∃z[P (z, x) ∧ P (z, y)] (Overlap)(A6) ∀x, y[O (x, y) → ∃z∀u[C(u, z) ↔ ∃v(P (v, x) ∧ P (v, y) ∧ C(v, u))]] (Existence of a unique intersection x ∩ y for overlap-(A7) ∀x[∃ y[¬C( y, x)] → ∃z∀u[C(u, z) ↔ ∃v(¬C(v, x) ∧ C(v, u))]] (Existence of a unique complements −x for elementsping elements x and y)x (cid:12)= 1)(D4) EC(x, y) ≡def C(x, y) ∧ ¬O (x, y) (External connection)(D6) NTP(x, y) ≡def P (x, y) ∧ ¬∃z[EC(z, x) ∧ EC(z, y)]) (Non-tangential parthood)(A8) ∀x∃z∀u[C(u, z) ↔ ∃v(NTP(v, x) ∧ C(v, u))] (Existence of a unique interior i(x) for every x)(D7) c(x) ≡def −i(−x) (Closure operation)(A9) c(1) = 1 (Closure as a total function)(D8) OP(x) ≡def x = i(x) (Open individuals)(A10) ∀x, y[(OP(x) ∧ OP( y) ∧ O (x, y)) → OP(x ∩ y)] (Intersection of open individuals is open)(A11) ∃x, y[EC(x, y)] (Existence of two externally connected elements)(D11) WCont(x, y) ≡def ¬C(c(x), c( y)) ∧ ∀z[(P (x, z) ∧ OP(z)) → C(c(z), y)] (Weak contact)(A12) ∃x, y[WCont(x, y)] (Existence of two weakly connected elements)(A13) ∀x∃ y[P (x, y) ∧ O P ( y) ∧ ∀z((P (x, z) ∧ OP(z)) → P ( y, z))] (Existence of a smallest open neighborhood n(x) for every x)Notice that the elements implied by the axioms (A4)–(A8), (A13) are indeed unique which follows immediately from(A3). In this paper we have chosen a different notation than Asher and Vieu [1] for those elements since the originalnotations may be confused with operations of p-ortholattices. However, we adapted the number system for definitions fromthe original paper but just listed those that are needed to define the theory.−In the following we will consider subtheories of RT0 as illustrated in Fig. 1. RT will denote theory RT0 \ {( A13)}, RT−EC the theory RT0 \ {( A12), ( A13)}. Notice that this is a change to the previousthe theory RT0 \ {( A11), ( A12), ( A13)} and RTnaming of the subtheories as used in [22]. We exclude now axiom A13 from all of the subtheories, since it prevents densemodels.In the following lemma we have summarized some basic properties of models of RTwhich are theorems of the the-−ory RT−.Lemma 2.1. The theory RT−entails the following theorems.1. ∀x[x (cid:12)= 1 → ¬C(x, −x)].2. ∀x[x (cid:12)= 1 → −x (cid:12)= 1].3. ∀x[x (cid:12)= 1 → x ∪ −x = 1].4. ∀x, y[O (x, y) → C(x, y)].5. ∀x, y[P (x, y) → O (x, y)].6. ∀x[P (i(x), x)].7. ∀x, y[(NTP(x, y) ∧ P ( y, z)) → NTP(x, z)].T.

Assume C(x, −x). Then there is a v with ¬C(v, x) and C(v, x) by (A7), a contradiction.2. −x = 1 implies C(x, −x) by (A4), a contradiction to 1.3. Suppose ¬C(u, x). Then C(u, −x) by (A7) since C(u, u) by (A1). (A5) implies that x ∪ −x is in contact to every element,and, hence, x ∪ −x = 1 by (A3).4. Suppose O (x, y), i.e. there is an elements v with P (v, x) and P (v, y). By (A1) and (D1) (for P (v, x)) we concludeC(v, x). Applying (D1) (now for P (v, y)) again we obtain C(x, y).5. Suppose P (x, y). P (x, x) always holds from (D1). Then there exists a z so that P (z, x) and P (z, y), namely z = x. Thenby (D3) O (x, y).6. Suppose C(u, i(x)). Then there is v with NTP(v, x) and C(v, u). By (D6) we get P (v, x), and, hence, C(u, x). This showsP (i(x), x).7. Suppose NTP(x, y) and P ( y, z). Then we have P (x, y) and there is no u with EC(u, x) and EC(u, y). We obtain P (x, z).Assume there is a v with EC(v, x) and EC(v, z). Then we have C(v, x) which implies C(v, y) since P (x, y). Furthermore,we have ¬O (v, z) which implies ¬O (v, y) since P ( y, z). This shows that EC(v, y), a contradiction.8. Suppose C(u, i(x)). Then there is a v with NTP(v, x) and C(v, u). By 7. we obtain NTP(v, y) so that C(u, i( y)), and,hence, P (i(x), i( y)) follows.9. Suppose O (x, y). Then there is a v with P (v, x) and P (v, y). From 8. we obtain P (i(v), i(x)) and P (i(v), i( y)), and,hence, O (i(x), i( y)). Conversely, suppose O (i(x), i( y)). Then there is a v with P (v, i(x)) and P (v, i( y)). By 6. we getP (v, x) and P (v, y), i.e. O (x, y).10. Assume O (c(x), −x). Then there is a v with P (v, c(x)) and P (v, −x). The first property implies P (i(v), −i(−x)) by 6.and the definition of the closure operation. From the second we conclude P (i(v), i(−x)) by 8. Together we obtainO (−i(−x), i(−x)). 4. gives C(−i(−x), i(−x)) which is a contradiction to 1. (cid:2)2.2. RepresentationIn this paper, we will use the phrase representation in a very general way. For a representation we do not require thatthe elements in question are described by a different kind of elements. In our sense, an equivalent description by a differentstructure (possibly same universe) is regarded as a representation.The main goal of our work is to provide a sound algebraic theory of the mereotopology RT. In earlier work [21,22], wecompared different mathematical representations of mereotopology: topological spaces, lattices, and graphs. It turned outthat – at least for the class of mereotopological theories with a single primitive and a reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitiveparthood relation – lattices and algebraic structures are most appropriate for a representation. Notice, that the originalpaper by Asher and Vieu [1] already provided a soundness and completeness proof with respect to arbitrary topologicalspaces, of which a subset of sets satisfies a set of conditions. However, this result does not establish equivalence up toisomorphism. That is exactly what we now provide. Moreover, the chosen structure here is applicable in a more generalcontext: the work of Düntsch and Winter [14,15] used contact lattices to represent the models of the well-known RCC. Somegeneralizations have been proposed in [23]. This work continues this tradition and shows close relation of RTto thesestructures. Our algebraic representation implies that Stonian p-ortholattices give rise to a class of contact algebras, whichallows us to unveil the exact algebraic relationships between the mereotopologies RCC and RTin [31]. Since lattice theoryis well-explored, many properties and characteristics of the classes of lattices can be applied to the mereotopologies theyrepresent. Eventually, we hope that a topological representation of the Stonian p-ortholattices exhibits the exact topologicalnature of the models of RT−−−.−3. p-ortholatticesThis section develops the theory of Stonian p-ortholattices from basic and well-known lattice concepts. The section devel-ops the mathematical theory for the representation theorem of RT0. For standard lattice-theoretic concepts not explainedhere, we refer to [4,5,20]. We first introduce pseudocomplemented, quasicomplemented, and orthocomplemented latticesand show how their properties restrict the class of p-ortholattices. Then, we demonstrate that every pseudocomplementedortholattice must be also quasicomplemented. In the style of Glivenko and Frink, we define the skeleton (or center) ofp-ortholattices and show how the pseudocomplementation and quasicomplementation operators can be used to define aninterior and closure mapping with p-ortholattices.We pay attention to the regularity conditions defined by Asher in Vieu in their “intended models” and show how theyrelate to properties that are satisfied in all p-ortholattices. Finally we state an additional condition on p-ortholattices whichis required to give an isomorphic representation of the models of RT. We show equivalent versions of this condition and−1428T. Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–1440demonstrate that the class of p-ortholattices satisfying this additional condition is a natural class of lattices, satisfying theStone identities despite not being distributive in general.3.1. Pseudo- and quasicomplemented latticesDefinition 3.1. A pseudocomplemented lattice (or p-algebra) is an algebraic structure (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ , 0, 1(cid:14) of type (cid:13)2, 2, 1, 0, 0(cid:14)such thatP0.

A quasicomplemented lattice is a lattice in which every element has a quasicomplement, i.e. the dualaof a pseudocomplemented lattice. The following properties of quasicomplements simply follow from this duality.+Corollary 3.3. Let (cid:13)L, +, ·,+ , 0, 1(cid:14) be a quasicomplemented lattice.

Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–14401429To emphasize the dual nature of pseudocomplemented and quasicomplemented lattices,the naming as meet-pseudocomplemented and join-pseudocomplemented are also common. A lattice that is both pseudo- and quasicomple-mented (or meet- and join-pseudocomplemented) is called double pseudocomplemented or double p-algebra.3.2. OrtholatticesDefinition 3.4. An ortholattice (or orthocomplemented lattice) is a structure (cid:13)L, +, ·,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) of type (cid:13)2, 2, 1, 0, 0(cid:14) such thatO0.

A pseudocomplemented ortholattice (or p-ortholattice) is a structure (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) of type (cid:13)2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0(cid:14)such thatPO0.

(cid:2)Again, we will use the properties of the previous lemma throughout the paper without mentioning.In [22], we gave a representation theorem for the theory of RT0 in terms of p-ortholattices. Later it will turn out thatp-ortholattices arising from mereotopology satisfy the additional property(x · y)∗ = x∗ + y∗.In the following section, we show that the topological “regularity” properties are maintained in all p-ortholattices.T. Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–14401431To conclude this section we want to provide an example of a p-ortholattice that does not satisfy the property above.Consider the p-ortholattice in Fig. 2. In this lattice we have x. Hence, the original representation theoremfrom [22] needs to be corrected by an additional condition. In Section 3.5, we introduce the notion of a skeleton of pseudo-−.complemented lattices and use it in Section 3.6 to define the additional condition required to represent the models of RTWe show that this results in a rather natural class of lattices, which we call Stonian p-ortholattices. Afterwards, a new repre-sentation theorem for the models of RT0 is given. It also shows the homomorphism from p-ortholattices to models of RT0directly, instead of relying on the representation of the intended models from [1]. It turns out that p-ortholattices wherethe additional property (x · y)∗ = xholds, actually satisfy all the Stone identities.∗ (cid:2) (x · y)∗∗ + y∗ + y∗3.4. RegularityNow we are in a position to prove some quintessential properties of p-ortholattices that capture conditions imposed onthe regions in the intended models of RT0. We show that the closure and interior mappings, a → a, are bothregular in the sense of [1]: cl(x) = cl(int(x)) and int(x) = int(cl(x)) hold for all regions in the topological interpretation of. We show that the algebraic counterparts of these properties hold in any p-ortholattice.the models of RTand a → a++∗∗−Lemma 3.8. Let (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) be a p-ortholattice.

SkeletonSkeletons (also called centers) have been first defined in 1929 by Glivenko in the context of distributive lattices. Later,Frink [17] generalized this result to arbitrary pseudocomplemented meet-semilattices. Since p-ortholattices and their dualsare a subclass of the meet-semilattices, we can define skeletons and dual skeletons on p-ortholattices using pseudo- andquasicomplementation. Then, both the skeletons and dual skeletons are always Boolean.Definition 3.9. Let (cid:13)L, ·,∗ , 0(cid:14) be a pseudocomplemented semilattice. Let S(L) = {athe order relation of L and with meet a ∧ b = a · b and union a ∨ b = (a∗ · b∗)∗.∗ | a ∈ L} be the skeleton of L, maintainingTheorem 3.10 (Glivenko–Frink theorem). (See [17].) Let L be a pseudocomplemented semilattice. Then S(L) is a Boolean algebra. The(unique) complement of an element a ∈ S(L) is its pseudocomplement a∗ ∈ L.Theorem 3.11 (Glivenko’s theorem). (See [17].) Let L be a pseudocomplemented semilattice. Then the mapping a → afrom L to S(L)is a closure operation. The mapping is a homomorphism preserving meets, pseudocomplements, the 0 element, and joins when theyexist. S(L) is complete if L is complete.∗∗More details, the proof, and a list of properties of the skeleton of pseudocomplemented lattices can be found in [5]. Weimmediately derive the following corollary for skeletons of pseudocomplements in p-ortholattices.Corollary 3.12. Let (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) be a p-ortholattice. Then S(L) = {aunion x ∨ y = (xa Boolean algebra.

Stonian p-ortholatticesHere we introduce an additional condition for p-ortholattices that do not hold for all p-ortholattices as demonstrated byFig. 2. We show that for all p-ortholattices that satisfy this additional condition, the skeleton as introduced in the previoussection is in fact Boolean. This suffices to define the Stonian p-ortholattices which will be used for the representation ofmodels of RTin the following sections.−Definition 3.15. A p-ortholattice (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) is called Stonian iff (x · y)∗ = x∗ + y∗for all x, y ∈ L.The next lemma shows that the skeleton S(L) for Stonian p-ortholattices is not only a Boolean algebra (as stated inCorollary 3.12) but in fact a Boolean subalgebra of L, i.e. x ∨ y = x + y.Lemma 3.16. If (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) is a Stonian p-ortholattice, then S(L) is a Boolean subalgebra of L.Proof. By [17] it remains to show that x ∨ y = x + y for all elements x, y ∈ S(L). This follows for Stonian p-ortholatticesimmediately from∗ · yx ∨ y = (x∗∗ + y= x= x + y.∗)∗∗∗L Stonian∗complement in S(L)This completes the proof. (cid:2)Dually, we can show that for Stonian p-ortholattices the dual skeleton ¯S(L) is also a subalgebra of L, i.e. x ∧ y = x · y.Corollary 3.17. If (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) is a Stonian p-ortholattice, then ¯S(L) is a Boolean subalgebra of L.Now, we can justify the naming of these p-ortholattices as Stonian in the tradition of pseudocomplemented distributivelattices that satisfy the Stone identities. A Stone lattice is defined to be a pseudocomplemented distributive lattice that∗∗ = 1. However, thissatisfies any (one) of the equivalent conditions (1), (3), and (5) of Theorem 3.18 or (∀x, y ∈ L) xcondition is true for all p-ortholattices (compare Lemma 3.7(2)), so it is not sufficient to prove any of the other equiv-alent properties for p-ortholattices. The following theorem shows the applicability of the remaining Stone identities forp-ortholattices (see [5] for more details). Moreover, it shows that every Stonian p-ortholattice is indeed a double Stonianp-ortholattice.∗ + xTheorem 3.18. Let (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) be a p-ortholattice.

In the next two sections, we show that the models ofthe theory RT0 are isomorphic to the class of Stonian p-ortholattices.4. From models of RT−to Stonian p-ortholattices−A model U of RTconsists of a set and a primitive relation C . In addition, we can define the relation P and – using theaxioms (A3) and (A6)–(A9) – we can define the operations ∪, ∩, −, i, and c.

However, besidesthe different scope of that mereotopology the set of primitive or derived operations is different. In particular, Clarke’smereotopology contains an infinite fusion operation whereas Asher and Vieu’s theory has an explicit complement.Lemma 4.1. Let U be a model of RT−. Then (cid:13)U ∪ {0}, +, ·,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) is an ortholattice with C(x, y) ⇔ x (cid:3) y⊥for all x, y ∈ U .Proof. In order to prove that U ∪ {0} is an ortholattice we just show that x⊥is an orthocomplement of x.1434T. Hahmann et al. / Artificial Intelligence 173 (2009) 1424–1440O1(a): If x = 0 or x = 1, then x⊥ (cid:12)= 0 by definition and x⊥⊥ = x follows immediately from the definition. Suppose x (cid:12)= 0 and x (cid:12)= 1. Then x⊥ = −x,⊥⊥ = −− x. We want to show that C(u, −− x)i.e. xiff C(u, x) which implies by (A3) that x = −− x. Therefore, suppose C(u, −− x) and ¬C(u, x). Axiom (A7) impliesthat C(−− x, −x), a contradiction to Lemma 2.1(1). Conversely, suppose C(u, x) and ¬C(u, −− x). The latter impliesC(v, −x) or ¬C(v, u) for all v. In particular, we get C(x, −x) or ¬C(x, u). The first property is a contradiction toLemma 2.1(1) and the second to the assumption C(u, x).⊥ (cid:12)= 1 by Lemma 2.1(2). This implies x⊥ = 0 by the definition of · andThen Lemma 2.1(4) implies C(x, −x), a contradiction to Lemma 2.1(1). We conclude ¬O (x, −x), and, hence, x · x. Suppose x (cid:12)= 0 and x (cid:12)= 1 and assume that O (x, −x).⊥ = 0.⊥⊥ = 0 (cid:2) x.Now suppose x (cid:12)= 0 and x (cid:12)= 1. In this case y (cid:12)= 0, and the case y = 1 follows as above so that we assume y (cid:12)= 0 and⊥ = − y and x (cid:2) y is equivalent to P (x, y). Let be C(u, − y). Then therey (cid:12)= 1. Notice that in this case xis a v with ¬C(v, y) and C(v, u). By the definition of P we conclude ¬C(v, x), and, hence, C(u, −x). This impliesP (− y, −x), and, hence, yfollows immediately. If x = 1, then y = 1 and we obtain y⊥⊥ (cid:2) 1 = x⊥ = −x, y⊥⊥ (cid:2) x⊥.O1(b): If x = 0 or x = 1, then x · xO1(c): Suppose x (cid:2) y. If x = 0, then y⊥ = − y ∈ U so that we obtain P (x, − y).

Notice that y (cid:12)= 1, i.e. − y exists⊥, since y is not universally connected. By (A7) we conclude C(u, − y), and, hence P (x, − y). From x, − y ∈ Uand is equal to y⊥we conclude x (cid:2) y. This completes the proof. (cid:2). The latter implies that y⊥Now we may define pseudocomplementation and quasicomplementation by:∗ ≡def int(x)⊥,x⊥).+ ≡def int(xxThe following two propositions do not have a corresponding result for Clarke’s mereotopology.Lemma 4.2. Let U be a model of RT−. Then (cid:13)U ∪ {0}, +, ·,∗ , 0, 1(cid:14) is a p-algebra.∗Proof. We have to show that x · y = 0 iff y (cid:2) x+ (cid:2) y. This immediately impliesx⊥ = 1⊥x · y = 0 ⇔ x⇔ x⇔ y (cid:2) x⊥ + y⊥+ (cid:2) y∗.. Instead we show that x+is a quasicomplement of x, i.e. x + y = 1 iff+ (cid:2) 1. If y = 0, then x = 1. If x = 1 we immediately concludeSuppose x + y = 1. If x = 0, then y = 1, and, hence, x+ = i(−x). Let be C(u, i(−x)).+ = 0 (cid:2) y. Now suppose x, y ∈ U with x (cid:12)= 0, 1 and y (cid:12)= 0 which implies x + y = x ∪ y and xxThen there is a v ∈ U with NTP(v, −x) and C(v, u). Assume ¬O (u, −x). Then EC(u, −x) since C(u, −x) which followsfrom P (i(−x), −x) (Lemma 2.1(5)) and C(u, i(−x)). On the other hand, we conclude ¬O (u, v) since otherwise O (u, v) andP (v, −x) obtained from NTP(v, −x) implies O (u, −x). Since C(v, u) we get EC(u, v). Together EC(u, −x) and EC(u, v) is acontradiction to NTP(v, −x). Therefore, we must have O (u, −x). Consequently, u ∩ −x exists, and we have ¬C(u ∩ −x, x)since otherwise C(x, −x) would follow. Since x + y = 1 we conclude that C(u ∩ −x, y), and, hence, C(u, y). We obtain+ (cid:2) y. If x = 0, then y = 1, and, hence, x + y = 1. If x = 1, x + y = 1P (i(−x), y), and, hence, x⊥ = −x by Lemma 4.1,follows immediately. Now suppose x, y ∈ U and x (cid:12)= 0, 1, i.e. xi.e. P (u, −x). Since we have P (i(u), u) by Lemma 2.1(5) and P (i(u), i(−x)) by Lemma 2.1(7) we obtain O (u, i(−x)). Lemma+ (cid:2) y we have C(u, y).

It remains to show that (x · y)∗ = x∗ + y∗. To this end we show(∗)int(x · y) = int(x) · int( y)which immediately implies(x · y)∗ = int(x · y)⊥(cid:2)=int(x) · int( y)= int(x)⊥ + int( y)⊥∗.= x∗ + y(cid:3)⊥(∗)If x = 0 or y = 0, (∗) is true by definition. Suppose x (cid:12)= 0 and y (cid:12)= 0, i.e. int(x) = i(x) and int( y) = i( y). If ¬O (x, y), theni(x · y) = 0. From Lemma 2.1(9) we obtain ¬O (i(x), i( y)), and, hence, i(x) · i( y) = 0. Suppose we have O (x, y), i.e. x · y = x ∩ y.Then we have O (i(x), i( y)) by Lemma 2.1(9) so that i(x) · i( y) = i(x) ∩ i( y) follows.T.

This implies P (i(x∩ y), i(x)∩ i( y)), i.e. i(x∩ y) (cid:2) i(x)∩ i( y).Conversely, i(x) and i( y) are open so that i(x) ∩ i( y) is open by (A10), i.e. i(i(x) ∩ i( y)) = i(x) ∩ i( y). Furthermore,i(x) (cid:2) x and i( y) (cid:2) y (Lemma 2.1(5)) implies i(x) ∩ i( y) (cid:2) x ∩ y, and, hence, i(x) ∩ i( y) = i(i(x) ∩ i( y)) (cid:2) i(x ∩ y) usingLemma 2.1(8). (cid:2)5.

The second property x (cid:2) y implies x · y∗ (cid:2) y · y∗) is a contradiction to NTP(x, y). Conversely, suppose ¬C(x, y∗) and EC(x, y++ (cid:2) y. Assume there is a z (cid:12)= 0 with EC(z, x) and EC(z, y). Then C(z, x) and z · y = 0, i.e. z (cid:2) y∗, x), a contradiction. Therefore, we have NTP(x, y).∗), and, hence, C( ySince y · yfollows.

(cid:2)and y∗As already mentioned all four lattices of Figs. 4, 5 satisfy (A11), i.e. the pair (x, x∗) always satisfies EC(x, x∗), so that theprevious theorem induces the following corollary.Corollary 7.3. Let (cid:13)L, +, ·,∗ ,⊥ , 0, 1(cid:14) be a Stonian p-ortholattice that satisfies (A12). Then L also satisfies (A11).Proof. By Theorem 7.2 one of the four lattices C14, C16, C18 or C20 is a subalgebra of L. In that subalgebra we have∗). None of the properties does dependx (cid:4) xon any other element in L so that EC(x, x∗ = 0. This is equivalent to C(x, x∗) also holds in L. (cid:2)∗) and ¬O (x, x∗), i.e. EC(x, xand x · x++ = x∗⊥This finishes the representation of the theory RT (RT0 without (A13)). The last corollary shows that (A11) is captured by(A12) and thus unnecessary in the full theory. However, this is far from obvious in the original theory and in the topologicalmodels to which soundness and completeness has been proved.8. Conclusion and outlookIn this paper we have provided a representation of RT and its subtheories by Stonian p-ortholattices. This representationshows that the connection relation can be uniquely defined through the lattice structure alone. Since the lattices are onlydefined by their order and meet relation, this hints that the theory can also be based on parthood and overlap relationscan be based on the properties of Stonianwhile having exactly the same models. An alternative axiomatization of RTp-ortholattices (orthocomplementation, pseudocomplementation, Stone identity) which can be defined solely in terms ofthe partial order underlying the lattice. Together with the operations of ortho- and pseudo-complementation, we are thenable to uniquely define the contact relation C(x, y) ⇔ x (cid:4) y.−⊥The paper gives a full lattice-theoretic characterization of the models of RT and RT. It contributes to the understandingof different region-based (point-free) QSR frameworks. In particular, as a pure mathematical account it helps in understand-ing the models of the theory RT. The main part of the paper introduces Stonian p-ortholattices as generalization of thewell-known (distributive) Stone lattices. The work exhibits the non-distributive character of Asher and Vieu’s [1] spatialtheory, which is so far unique amongst mereotopologies. All other characterizations [3,14,27] have identified Boolean orpseudocomplemented distributive lattices as models of other mereotopologies. This paper is a significant step towards aunified lattice-theoretic account of mereotopologies and, more generally, of qualitative region-based theories of space.−In Section 6 we have shown that distributivity forces Stonian p-ortholattices to be Boolean algebras, i.e. all three comple-ment operations coincide. In that case the contact relation collapses to overlap similar to Clarke’s original system. As alreadydiscussed in the introduction this is not a defect since Stonian p-ortholattices describe a larger set of regions than distribu-tive theories such as RCC and their algebraic counterpart, Boolean contact algebras (BCAs). On the contrary, this fact actuallyshows that distributivity is not a desired property in Asher and Vieu’s framework. Even though Stonian p-ortholattices are,in general, not distributive, their skeleton (and its dual) is. For a detailed study of the relationship between BCAs and Stonianp-ortholattices via their skeleton we refer to [31].Further work will concentrate on topological representation theorems of Stonian p-ortholattices similar to those alreadydeveloped for Boolean contact algebras. This will also clarify the exact nature of the topological models of RT0.1440T.
