For that, we introduce four different expressivity characteristics that quantitatively assess the number of different knowledge bases that a measure can distinguish. Our approach aims at complementing ongoing discussions on rationality postulates for inconsistency measures by considering expressivity as a desirable property. We evaluate 16 different measures on the proposed characteristics and conclude that the distance-based measure I(cid:2)dalal from Grant and Hunter (2013) [8] and the proof-based measure IPm from Jabbour and Raddaoui (2013) [16]have maximal expressivity along all considered characteristics. In our study, we discovered several interesting relationships of inconsistency measurement to e.g. set theory and Boolean functions and we also report these findings.© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionInconsistency measurement is about the quantitative assessment of the severity of inconsistencies in knowledge bases. Consider the following two knowledge bases K1 and K2 formalized in propositional logic:K1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Both knowledge bases are classically inconsistent as for K1 we have {a, ¬a ∧ ¬b} |(cid:4)⊥ and for K2 we have, e.g., {a, ¬a} |(cid:4)⊥. These inconsistencies render the whole knowledge bases useless for reasoning if one wants to use classical reasoning tech-niques. In order to make the knowledge bases useful again, one can either rely on non-monotonic/paraconsistent reasoning techniques [23,27] or one revises the knowledge bases appropriately to make them consistent [9]. Looking at the knowledge bases K1 and K2 one can observe that the severity of their inconsistency is different. In K1, only two out of four formulas (a and ¬a ∧ ¬b) are “participating” in making K1 inconsistent while for K2 all formulas contribute to its inconsistency. Furthermore, for K1 only two propositions (a and b) are conflicting and using e.g. paraconsistent reasoning one could still infer meaningful statements about c and d. For K2 no such statement can be made. This leads to the assessment that K2should be regarded more inconsistent than K1.Inconsistency measures can be used to analyze inconsistencies and to provide insights on how to repair them. An incon-sistency measure I is a function on knowledge bases, such that the larger the value I(K) the more severe the inconsistency in K. A lot of different approaches of inconsistency measures have been proposed, mostly for classical propositional logic [10,12,13,22,25,32,7,8,24,15], but also for classical first-order logic [6], description logics [21,33], default logics [5], and prob-abilistic and other weighted logics [19,30,26]. Due to this plethora of inconsistency measures it is hard to determine which E-mail address: thimm@uni-koblenz.de.http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2016.01.0130004-3702/© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Rationality postulates have been proposed that ad-dress the issue of assessing the quality of a measure—see e.g. [11,25]—but many of these properties have been criticized to address only a specific point of view, see [2] for a recent discussion on this topic.In this paper, we take a different perspective on the evaluation of inconsistency measures by considering a quantitativeanalysis of their expressivity, that is, we study how many different (inconsistent) knowledge bases can be distinguished by a given inconsistency measure. By the term expressivity we here refer to the property of a semantical concept—here, an inconsistency measure—and its capability to distinguish syntactical constructs—here, knowledge bases—, similarly as it has been done for the analysis of expressivity of semantics for other logical languages, see e.g. skepticism relations for formal argumentation [1]. Our analysis is meant to complement the study on rationality postulates and is, of course, not meaningful on its own as the compliance of measures with the basic intuitions behind inconsistency measures can only be assessed by rationality postulates. However, we introduce expressivity of inconsistency measures as an additional method to evaluate their quality. In particular, we propose four different expressivity characteristics that quantify the relation between the number of different values of an inconsistency measure wrt. different notions of the size of the knowledge base, such as number of formulas or number of propositions. We conduct a thorough comparative analysis of 16 different inconsistency measures from the literature [12,13,7,17,31,8,25,16,32,5] and classify these measures in a hierarchy of expressivity. In our study, we made several interesting observations, such as the relation between the measure IMI [7] and Sperner families [28]and of the measure Ifrom Grant and Hunter [8] and the proof-based measure IPm from Jabbour and Raddaoui [16] have maximal expressivity along all considered characteristics.MIC [7] with profiles of Boolean functions. One of our results is that the distance-based measure I(cid:2)dalalIn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:1. We conduct a focused survey of 16 inconsistency measures from the recent literature (Section 3).2. We propose four different expressivity characteristics, evaluate the considered inconsistency measures wrt. these char-acteristics, and study our findings (Section 4).3. We classify the evaluated measures into hierarchies of expressivity and thus provide a means to quantitatively compare different measures (Section 5).We give necessary preliminaries in Section 2 and provide a summary in Section 6. Appendix A contains proofs of technical results and Appendix B lists all example knowledge bases and families of knowledge bases used in the paper. All incon-sistency measures discussed in this paper have been implemented and an online interface to try out these measures is available.12. PreliminariesLet At be some fixed propositional signature, i.e., a (possibly infinite) set of propositions, and let L(At) be the corre-sponding propositional language constructed using the usual connectives ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and ¬ (negation).Definition 1. A knowledge base K is a finite set of formulas K ⊆ L(At). Let K be the set of all knowledge bases.If X is a formula or a set of formulas we write At( X) to denote the set of propositions appearing in X . Semantics to a propositional language is given by interpretations and an interpretation ω on At is a function ω : At → {true, false}. Let (cid:4)(At)denote the set of all interpretations for At. An interpretation ω satisfies (or is a model of) a proposition a ∈ At, denoted by ω |(cid:4) a, if and only if ω(a) = true. The satisfaction relation |(cid:4) is extended to formulas in the usual way.As an abbreviation we sometimes identify an interpretation ω with its complete conjunction, i.e., if a1, . . . , an ∈ At are those propositions that are assigned true by ω and an+1, . . . , am ∈ At are those propositions that are assigned false by ω we identify ω by a1 . . . anan+1 . . . am (or any permutation of this). For example, the interpretation ω1 on {a, b, c} with ω(a) = ω(c) = true and ω(b) = false is abbreviated by abc.For (cid:5) ⊆ L(At) we also define ω |(cid:4) (cid:5) if and only if ω |(cid:4) φ for every φ ∈ (cid:5). Define furthermore the set of models Mod( X) = {ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) | ω |(cid:4) X} for every formula or set of formulas X . If Mod( X) = ∅ we also write X |(cid:4)⊥ and say that X is inconsistent.3. Inconsistency measuresLet R∞≥0 be the set of non-negative real values including ∞. Inconsistency measures are functions I : K → R∞≥0 that aim at assessing the severity of the inconsistency in a knowledge base K, cf. [7]. The basic idea is that the larger the inconsistency in K the larger the value I(K) and I(K) = 0 if and only if K is consistent. However, inconsistency is a concept that is not easily quantified and there have been a couple of proposals for inconsistency measures so far, in particular for1 http://tweetyproject.org/w/incmes/.122M.

We selected 16 inconsistency measures from the literature in order to conduct our analysis on expressivity, taken from [12,13,7,17,31,8,25,16,32,5]. We briefly introduce these measures in this section for the sake of completeness, but we refer for a detailed explanation to the corresponding original papers.To illustrate the different inconsistency measures we will use the knowledge bases K1 and K2 from the introduction as running examples.Example 1. Let At = {a, b, c, d} and define knowledge bases K1 and K2 as follows:K1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}A summary of the formal definitions of the considered inconsistency measures can be found in Table 1. We will discuss these measures in more detail below.3.1. The drastic inconsistency measureThe basic motivation for measuring inconsistency is to provide a graded assessment of inconsistency and not only a “consistent”/“inconsistent” assessment. However, in order to evaluate more sophisticated measures and the usefulness of rationality postulates (cf. beginning of Section 4), the drastic inconsistency measure Id—that can only distinguish between consistent and inconsistent knowledge bases—is usually used as a baseline approach, cf. e.g. [12].M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151123Definition 2. The drastic inconsistency measure Id : K → R∞≥0 is defined as(cid:2)1 if K |(cid:4)⊥0 otherwiseId(K) =for K ∈ K.In other words, Id(K) = 1 if and only if K is inconsistent (and 0 otherwise).Example 2. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}As both K1 and K2 are inconsistent we obtain Id(K1) = Id(K2) = 1.3.2. Inconsistency measures based on minimal inconsistenciesOne approach to assess the severity of inconsistency in a knowledge base is to focus on its set of minimal inconsistent (cid:14) |(cid:4)⊥. Let MI(K)subsets. A set M ⊆ K is called minimal inconsistent subset (MI) of K if M |(cid:4)⊥ and there is no Mbe the set of all MIs of K. Informally speaking, minimal inconsistent subsets contain the essence of the inconsistency in a knowledge base. Every formula participating in creating an inconsistency is part of at least one minimal inconsistent subset.A straightforward approach to use minimal inconsistent subsets for measuring inconsistency is to take their number as (cid:14) ⊂ M with Man indicator [12].Definition 3. The MI-inconsistency measure IMI : K → R∞≥0 is defined asIMI(K) = |MI(K)|for K ∈ K.One drawback of IMI is that it treats every inconsistent subset of K equally. A knowledge base with one minimal inconsis-tent subset of size 2 has the same inconsistency value as another knowledge base with one minimal inconsistent subset of size 10. It is usually acknowledged that a smaller minimal inconsistent subset is more severe than a larger one, cf. [12]. The MIc inconsistency measure takes this into account and is defined as follows.Definition 4. The MIc -inconsistency measure I(cid:3)IMIC (K) =M∈MI(K)for K ∈ K.1|M|MIC : K → R∞≥0 is defined asIn other words, for every minimal inconsistent subset M of K, 1/|M| is added up in order to obtain Ilarger minimal inconsistent subset contribute less to the overall inconsistency value than smaller ones.MIC (K). In this way, Example 3. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Here we haveMI(K1) = {{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}MI(K2) = {{a, ¬a}, {b, ¬b}}Therefore we obtain IMI(K1) = 1 and IMI(K2) = 2 and1|{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}|MIC (K1) == 12IIMIC (K2) =1|{a, ¬a}|+1|{b, ¬b}|= 1124M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151The measure IMIC has been further extended in [25] where not only the sizes of the different minimal inconsistent sub-sets but also their distribution in a knowledge base has been considered. For every knowledge base K and i = 1, . . . , |K|, defineMI(i)(K) = {M ∈ MI(K) | |M| = i}CN(i)(K) = {C ⊆ K | |C| = i ∧ C (cid:16)|(cid:4)⊥}That is, MIi(K) is the set of minimal inconsistent subsets of K of size i and CN(i)(K) is the set of consistent subsets of Kof size i. Furthermore define(cid:2)R i(K) =0|MI(i)(K)|/(|MI(i)(K)| + |CN(i)(K)|) otherwiseif |MI(i)(K)| + |CN(i)(K)| = 0for i = 1, . . . , |K|. The value R i(K) thus gives the ratio of minimal inconsistent sets of size i to the number of minimal inconsistent and consistent subsets of size i. Obviously, if for two knowledge bases K and K(cid:14), a value R i(K) is larger than R i(K(cid:14)) (for some i and everything else being equal) than K should be regarded more inconsistent than K(cid:14). The idea of the approach of Mu et al. [25] is to weigh these values also wrt. the sizes, i.e., a large R i(K) has more impact than a large R j(K), with j > i.Definition 5. The D f -inconsistency measure ID f: K → R∞≥0 is defined asID f (K) = 1 − (cid:11)|K|i=1(1 − R i(K)/i)for K ∈ K.Note that the above definition of ID f represents only a single instance of the family introduced in [25]. Other variants can be obtained by other ways of aggregating the values R1(K), . . . , R|K|(K).Example 4. We continue Example 3 and recallMI(K1) = {{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}MI(K2) = {{a, ¬a}, {b, ¬b}}Then we haveMI(2)(K1) = {{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}MI(2)(K2) = {{a, ¬a}, {b, ¬b}}and MI(i)(K1) = ∅ for i (cid:16)= 2and MI(i)(K2) = ∅ for i (cid:16)= 2Furthermore, we haveCN(1)(K1) = {{a}, {b ∨ c}, {¬a ∧ ¬b}, {d}}CN(2)(K1) = {{a, b ∨ c}, {a, d}, {b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b}, {b ∨ c, d}, {¬a ∧ b, d}}CN(3)(K1) = {{a, b ∨ c, d}, {b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}}CN(4)(K1) = ∅andCN(1)(K2) = {{a}, {¬a}, {b}, {¬b}}CN(2)(K2) = {{a, b}, {a, ¬b}, {¬a, b}, {¬a, ¬b}}CN(3)(K2) = ∅CN(4)(K2) = ∅yieldingR1(K1) = 0R2(K1) = 1/6R3(K1) = 0R4(K1) = 0andR1(K2) = 0R2(K2) = 2/6R3(K2) = 0R4(K2) = 0M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151125Finally, we obtainID f (K1) = 1 − (1 − R1(K1))(1 − R2(K1)/2)(1 − R3(K1)/3)(1 − R4(K1)/4)= 16 · 2= 112ID f (K2) = 1 − (1 − R1(K2))(1 − R2(K2)/2)(1 − R3(K2)/3)(1 − R4(K2)/4)= 26 · 2= 16Another simple approach for utilizing minimal inconsistent subsets is to use the number of formulas occurring in some minimal inconsistent subsets—that is, the number of problematic formulas—as the inconsistency value, cf. e.g. [7].Definition 6. The problematic inconsistency measure Ip : K → R∞≥0 is defined as(cid:4)M|M∈MI(K)Ip(K) = |for K ∈ K.Example 5. We continue Example 3 and recallMI(K1) = {{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}MI(K2) = {{a, ¬a}, {b, ¬b}}Then Ip(K1) = 2 and Ip(K2) = 4.3.3. Inconsistency measures based on maximal consistencyAnother family closely related to the family of measures based on minimal inconsistent subsets is the one based on maximal consistent subsets. Let MC(K) be the set of maximal consistent subsets of K, i.e.MC(K) = {K(cid:14) ⊆ K | K(cid:14) (cid:16)|(cid:4)⊥ ∧∀K(cid:14)(cid:14) (cid:2) K(cid:14) : K(cid:14)(cid:14) |(cid:4)⊥}Note, that a maximal consistent subset can be obtained by removing one formula from each minimal inconsistent subset from the knowledge base. Thus, the number of maximal consistent subsets and the number of minimal inconsistent sets correlate.Furthermore, let SC(K) be the set of self-contradictory formulas of K, i.e.SC(K) = {φ ∈ K | φ |(cid:4)⊥}An inconsistency measure that takes both maximal consistent subsets and self-contradictory formulas into account can be defined as follows, cf. e.g. [7].Definition 7. The MC-inconsistency measure Imc : K → R∞≥0 is defined asImc(K) = |MC(K)| + |SC(K)| − 1for K ∈ K.Note that the subtraction of 1 in the definition of Imc is to ensure that a consistent knowledge base has inconsistency value 0 (a consistent knowledge base has one maximal consistent subset, itself, and no self-contradictory formulas).Another approach utilizing the idea of maximum consistency is the approach of Doder et al. [5].Definition 8. The nc-inconsistency measure Inc : K → R∞≥0 is defined asInc(K) = |K| − max{n | ∀K(cid:14) ⊆ K : |K(cid:14)| = n ⇒ K(cid:14) (cid:16)|(cid:4)⊥}for K ∈ K.In other words, the inconsistency of K is assessed by seeking a maximal value n ∈ {1, . . . , |K|} such that all subsets of size n of K are consistent. The larger this value n, the smaller the inconsistency. Note that the above definition of Inc differs from the original definition in [5] (where only the max-term was considered) in order to ensure that consistent knowledge bases receive a value of zero and the inconsistency value increases with increasing inconsistency.126M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151Example 6. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Here we haveMC(K1) = {{a, b ∨ c, d}, {b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}}MC(K2) = {{a, b}, {a, ¬b}, {¬a, b}, {¬a, ¬b}}and SC(K1) = SC(K2) = ∅. Therefore we obtainImc(K1) = 1Imc(K2) = 3Furthermore, note that for both K1 and K2 we can find subsets of size 2 that are inconsistent: {a, ¬a ∧ ¬b} for K1 and {a, ¬a} for K2. Furthermore, all one-element subsets of K1 and K2 are consistent, respectively. Therefore, we obtainInc(K1) = 3Inc(K2) = 33.4. Probabilistic inconsistency measuresOne of the first approaches to measuring inconsistency is Knight’s measure Iη , which is based on probability functions over the underlying propositional language [17]. Recall that (cid:4)(At) is the set of interpretations of the propositional language L(At). A probability function P on L(At) is a function P : (cid:4)(At) → [0, 1] with ω∈(cid:4)(At) P (ω) = 1. We extend P to assign a probability to any formula φ ∈ L(At) by defining(cid:6)P (φ) =(cid:3)ω|(cid:4)φP (ω)Let P(At) be the set of all those probability functions. The idea of Knight [17] is to seek a probability function that maxi-mizes the probability of each formula of a knowledge base K. If we can find a probability function that assigns probability 1to each formula this means that the knowledge base is consistent. If the knowledge base is inconsistent, then the probability mass must be distributed (recall that an inconsistent set of formulas cannot be satisfied by a single interpretation ω; thus the probability P (ω) can only be associated with a subset of this set). Therefore, the smaller the maximal probability that can be assigned to all formulas the more inconsistent the knowledge base.Definition 9. The η-inconsistency measure Iη : K → R∞≥0 is defined asIη(K) = 1 − max{ξ | ∃P ∈ P(At) : ∀α ∈ K : P (α) ≥ ξ }for K ∈ K.Note that we modified the definition of Iη slightly compared to the original definition in order to ensure that consistent knowledge bases receive an inconsistency value of zero.Instead of seeking a probability function to maximize the probabilities of the formulas in K, one can simplify this idea and seek only a minimal set of interpretations that need to receive a positive probability in order to ensure that every formula has a positive probability [31]. In other words, a subset H ⊆ (cid:4)(At) is called a hitting set of K if for every φ ∈ Kthere is ω ∈ H with ω |(cid:4) φ. Focusing only on minimizing the number of interpretations needed to form a hitting set we can define another measure as follows.Definition 10. The hitting-set inconsistency measure Ihs : K → R∞≥0 is defined asIhs(K) = min{|H| | H is a hitting set of K} − 1for K ∈ K with min ∅ = ∞.Note that Ihs(K) = ∞ if and only if K contains a self-contradictory formula, i.e., α ∈ K with α |(cid:4)⊥. In this case, no hitting set of K exists.M.

We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Consider the probability function P 1 ∈ P({a, b, c, d}) defined viaP 1(abcd) = P 1(abcd) = 0.5P 1(ω) = 0 for ω ∈ (cid:4)({a, b, c, d}) \ {abcd, abcd}Then we obtainP 1(a) = P 1(¬a ∧ ¬b) = 0.5P 1(b ∨ c) = P 1(d) = 1and thus P 1(φ) ≥ 0.5 for all φ ∈ K1. Furthermore, there can be no other PHence, we have Iη(K1) = 1 − 0.5 = 0.5. The function P 1 can also be used to determine Iη(K2) = 0.5.that assigns larger probability to all φ ∈ K1. (cid:14)The set H1 = {abcd, abcd} is also a hitting set of both K1 and K2 and there is no smaller set that is a hitting set. Therefore we obtain Ihs(K1) = Ihs(K2) = 1.3.5. Variable-based inconsistency measuresAnother approach to assess the severity of inconsistency is to take the number of propositions from At that participate in the inconsistency. The approach of Xiao and Ma [32] is to take the ratio of the propositions appearing in a minimal inconsistent subset wrt. the total number of propositions as the inconsistency value.Definition 11. The mv inconsistency measure Imv : K → R∞M∈MI(K) At(M)||At(K)|Imv (K) =(cid:5)|≥0 is defined asfor K ∈ K.In other words, Imv (K) is the ratio of the signature involved in minimal inconsistent subsets.Instead of utilizing minimal inconsistent subsets one can also using paraconsistent semantics to identify the part of the signature involved in inconsistency. In this paper, we will only consider the contension measure Ic —cf. e.g. [7]—and its normalized variant IL Pm from [13] as representatives of this family of measures. Similar approaches relying on the same ideas can be found in e.g. [21,20].The contension measure Ic utilizes three-valued interpretations for propositional logic [27]. A three-valued interpretation υ on At is a function υ : At → {T , F , B} where the values T and F correspond to the classical true and false, respectively. The additional truth value B stands for both and is meant to represent a conflicting truth value for a proposition. The function υis extended to arbitrary formulas as shown in Table 2. Then, an interpretation υ satisfies a formula α, denoted by υ |(cid:4)3 αif either υ(α) = T or υ(α) = B. Then inconsistency can be measured by seeking an interpretation υ that assigns B to a minimal number of propositions.Definition 12. The contension inconsistency measure Ic : K → R∞≥0 is defined asIc(K) = min{|υ−1(B)| | υ |(cid:4)3 K}for K ∈ K.128M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151In [13] a variant IL Pm of this measure was defined that further normalizes the inconsistency value by the number of propositions appearing in K.Definition 13. The normalized contension inconsistency measure IL Pm: K → R∞≥0 is defined asIL Pm (K) =Ic(K)|At(K)|for K ∈ K.Example 8. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}and recallMI(K1) = {{a, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}MI(K2) = {{a, ¬a}, {b, ¬b}}Then we haveImv (K1) =Imv (K2) =|{a, b}||{a, b, c, d}||{a, b}||{a, b}|= 1= 1/2Furthermore, consider υ1 : {a, b, c, d} → {T , F , B} defined viaυ1(a) = Bυ1(b) = Fυ1(c) = υ1(d) = TThen υ1 |(cid:4)3 φ for all φ ∈ K1 and there is no other υ(cid:14)IL Pm (K1) = 1/4. For υ2 : {a, b} → {T , F , B} defined viathat assigns B to fewer propositions, yielding Ic(K1) = 1 and υ2(a) = υ2(b) = Bwe have υ2 |(cid:4)3 φ for all φ ∈ K2 and there is no other υ(cid:14)IL Pm (K2) = 2/2 = 1.3.6. Distance-based inconsistency measuresthat assigns B to fewer propositions, yielding Ic(K2) = 2 and In [8] three families of inconsistency measures are defined that are based on a notion of distance to consistency. More precisely, an interpretation distance d is a function d : (cid:4)(At) × (cid:4)(At) → [0, ∞) that satisfies (let ω, ω(cid:14), ω(cid:14)(cid:14) ∈ (cid:4)(At))1. d(ω, ω(cid:14)) = 0 if and only if ω = ω(cid:14)2. d(ω, ω(cid:14)) = d(ω(cid:14), ω) (symmetry), and3. d(ω, ω(cid:14)(cid:14)) ≤ d(ω, ω(cid:14)) + d(ω(cid:14), ω(cid:14)(cid:14)) (triangle inequality).(reflexivity),One prominent example of such a distance is the Dalal distance dd defined viadd(ω, ω(cid:14)) = |{a ∈ At | ω(a) (cid:16)= ω(cid:14)(a)}|for all ω, ω(cid:14) ∈ (cid:4)(At). In other words, dd(ω, ω(cid:14)) is the number of propositions where ω and ω(cid:14)assign different truth values. If X ⊆ (cid:4)(At) is a set of interpretations we define dd( X, ω) = minω(cid:14)∈ X dd(ω(cid:14), ω) (if X = ∅ we define dd( X, ω) = ∞). While [8] consider arbitrary distances, we will focus here on the Dalal distance for reasons of simplicity.The basic idea of the approaches in [8] is to measure and aggregate the distances of the models of the formulas in a knowledge base K. For example, if a knowledge base K has two formulas and their models have a large distance to each other, then K should be regarded as more inconsistent compared to a knowledge base K(cid:14)with two formulas, where this is not the case. More precisely, the first approach from [8] considered here seeks an interpretation ω such that the sum of all distances of the sets of models to ω is minimal.M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151129Definition 14. The (cid:2)-distance inconsistency measure I(cid:2)dalal: K → R∞(cid:8)≥0 is defined asI(cid:2)dalal(K) = min(cid:7)(cid:3)α∈Kfor K ∈ K.dd(Mod(α), ω) | ω ∈ (cid:4)(At)Another approach of [8] is to seek an interpretation ω such that the maximum distance of the sets of models is minimal.Definition 15. The max-distance inconsistency measure I maxdalal(cid:9)dd(Mod(α), ω) | ω ∈ (cid:4)(At)dalal(K) = minImax(cid:2)maxα∈K: K → R∞≥0 is defined asfor K ∈ K.The final approach of [8] is to minimize the number of formulas, where their corresponding sets of models have a positive distance.Definition 16. The hit-distance inconsistency measure I hitdalal: K → R∞≥0 is defined asdalal(K) = min {|{α ∈ K | dd(Mod(α), ω) > 0}| | ω ∈ (cid:4)(At)}Ihitfor K ∈ K.Example 9. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Observe that for the interpretation ω1 = abcd ∈ (cid:4)({a, b, c, d}) we havedd(Mod(a), ω1) = 0dd(Mod(b ∨ c), ω1) = 0dd(Mod(¬a ∧ ¬b), ω1) = 1dd(Mod(d), ω1) = 0(cid:6)and therefore dalal(K1) = 1. Furthermore, we have maxα∈K1 dd(Mod(α), ω1) = 1 and there is also no other interpretation ω(cid:14)I(cid:2)smaller maximum distance. Hence, we have I maxwith a smaller total distance, so we have with a dd(Mod(α), ω1) = 1. There is no other interpretation ω(cid:14)dalal(K1) = 1. For K2 we obtaindalal(K1) = 1 and similarly I hitα∈K1I(cid:2)dalal(K2) = 2dalal(K2) = 1Imaxwith a similar argumentation as above. For I hitformula in {a, ¬a} and exactly one formula in {b, ¬b}. Therefore we obtain I hitdalal(K2) observe that every interpretation ω must always falsify exactly one dalal(K2) = 2.3.7. Proof-based inconsistency measuresThe final measure we consider in this paper is the proof-based measure from [16]. The basic idea is to count, for all propositions x ∈ At, both the number of minimal proofs for x and its negation ¬x. If there are many proofs for both, this indicates a large inconsistency in the knowledge base. In the context of [16] a minimal proof for α ∈ {x, ¬x | x ∈ At} in K is a set π ⊆ K such that1. α appears as a literal in π2. π |(cid:4) α, and3. π is minimal wrt. set inclusion.130M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151Note that this definition does not require that π is consistent. In particular, the set {a ∧ ¬a} is a minimal proof for both aand ¬a. Note furthermore, that item 1.) requires that α appears in the exact same form in π , e.g. a appears in a ∧ b but not in ¬a ∧ b (this is a syntactic criterion).Km (x) be the set of all minimal proofs of x in K. The proof-based measure of Jabbour and Raddaoui [16] can then Let Pbe defined by summing up the products of the number of minimal proofs for complementary literals.Definition 17. The proof-based inconsistency measure IPmKm (a)| · |PIPm (K) =Km (¬a)|(cid:3)|P: K → R∞≥0 is defined asa∈Atfor K ∈ K.Note that the definition of IPm is not the original definition but a characterization also provided in [16].Example 10. We continue Example 1 and considerK1 = {a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b, d}K2 = {a, ¬a, b, ¬b}Observe thatK1m (a) = {{a}}K1m (b) = {{a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}K1m (c) = {{a, b ∨ c, ¬a ∧ ¬b}}PK1m (¬a) = {{¬a ∧ ¬b}}PK1m (¬b) = {{¬a ∧ ¬b}}PK1m (¬c) = ∅K1m (d) = {{d}}PK1m (¬d) = ∅PPPPandK2m (a) = {{a}}PK2m (¬a) = {{¬a}}K2m (b) = {{b}}PK2m (¬b) = {{¬b}}PPIt follows thatIPm (K1) = 1 · 1 + 1 · 1 + 1 · 0 + 1 · 0 = 2IPm (K2) = 1 · 1 + 1 · 1 = 24. Expressivity characteristicsIn the literature, inconsistency measures are usually analytically evaluated on a set of rationality postulates.2 Some basic example postulates given in [11] are the following (let I be any inconsistency measure)Consistency I(K) = 0 if and only if K is consistentMonotony if K ⊆ K(cid:14)Independence for all α ∈ K, if α /∈ M for every M ∈ MI(K) then I(K) = I(K \ {α})then I(K) ≤ I(K(cid:14))Satisfaction of the property consistency ensures that all consistent knowledge bases receive a minimal inconsistency value and every inconsistent knowledge base receives a positive inconsistency value (we already implicitly required satisfaction of 2 Some few works also consider empirical evaluation on computational performance and accuracy of algorithms approximating existing inconsistency measures, see e.g. [22,24,31].M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151131this postulate in the definition of an inconsistency measure). The postulate monotony states that the value of inconsistency can only increase when adding new information. Independence states that removing “harmless” formulas from a knowledge base does not change the value of inconsistency. Besides these three postulates a series of other postulates have been proposed in the literature, see e.g. [11,25,2]. However, some of these postulates are disputed as each of them usually covers only a single aspect of inconsistency, such as independence, which focuses on the role of minimal inconsistent subsets. An excellent discussion on the rationality of various postulates for inconsistency measures can be found in [2]. Besides Besnard, several other authors have also criticized the rationality of individual postulates—discussions can be found in almost all papers cited before—and so there is some disagreement on which postulates are meaningful and which are not. One the one hand this calls for more work on rationality postulates and, on the other hand, it also suggests to investigate additional means for comparison. In the following, we propose a novel quantitative approach to evaluate and compare inconsistency measures that aims at complementing the existing approach of rationality postulates.The drastic inconsistency measure Id (see Table 1) is usually considered as a very naive baseline approach for inconsis-tency measurement. Surprisingly, this measure already satisfies many rationality postulates such as consistency, monotony, and independence (the proofs are straightforward). What sets it apart from other more sophisticated inconsistency measures is that it cannot differentiate between different inconsistent knowledge bases. However, this demand is exactly what incon-sistency measures are supposed to satisfy. While the qualitative behavior of inconsistency measures is being discussed quite deeply using rationality postulates, their quantitative properties in terms of expressivity have been almost neglected so far.3With expressivity of inconsistency measures we here mean the number of different values an inconsistency measure can attain. We investigate the expressivity of inconsistency measures along four different dimensions of subclasses of knowledge bases.Definition 18. Let φ be a formula. The length l(φ) of φ is recursively defined asl(φ) =⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩11 + l(φ(cid:14))1 + l(φ1) + l(φ2)1 + l(φ1) + l(φ2)if φ ∈ Atif φ = ¬φ(cid:14)if φ = φ1 ∧ φ2if φ = φ1 ∨ φ2Definition 19. Define the following subclasses of the set of all knowledge bases K:Kv (n) = {K ∈ K | |At(K)| ≤ n}K f (n) = {K ∈ K | |K| ≤ n}Kl(n) = {K ∈ K | ∀φ ∈ K : l(φ) ≤ n}Kp(n) = {K ∈ K | ∀φ ∈ K : |At(φ)| ≤ n}In other words, Kv (n) is the set of all knowledge bases that mention at most n different propositions, K f (n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain at most n formulas, Kl(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain only formulas with maximal length n, and Kp(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain only formulas that mention at most ndifferent propositions each. The motivation for considering these particular subclasses of knowledge bases is that each of them considers a different aspect of the size of a knowledge base. As a syntactical object, a knowledge base is a set of formulas, and both the number of formulas (considered by the class K f (n)) and the length of each formula (Kl(n)) are the essential parameters that define its size. From a semantical point of view, the number of propositions appearing in each formula (Kp(n)) and in the complete knowledge base (Kv (n)) define the scope of the knowledge. Larger numbers for both of them also indicate larger scope and thus greater size. Inconsistency measures should adhere to the size of the knowledge base in terms of their expressivity. For example, the number of possible inconsistency values of a particular measure should (cid:14)) with nnot decrease when moving from a set Kv (n) to set Kv (nformulas should provide a larger variety in terms of inconsistency as knowledge bases of size n. Indeed, this property is true for all considered measures as Kv (n) ⊆ Kv (n(cid:14)) (the same holds for all classes above).(cid:14) > n, as knowledge bases with n(cid:14)The aim of our expressivity analysis is to investigate the number of different values that a specific inconsistency measure can attain on different subclasses of knowledge bases. We formalize this idea using expressivity characteristics as follows.Definition 20. Let I be an inconsistency measure and n > 0. Let α ∈ {v, f , l, p}. The α-characteristic Cα(I, n) of I wrt. n is defined asCα(I, n) = |{I(K) | K ∈ Kα(n)}|3 Some few rationality postulates such as Attenuation [25] are addressing this issue only in some very limited form and from a particular point of view.132M.

Note that these characteristics are not always the same as the maximal value of an inconsistency measure on a specific set of knowledge bases, even if the codomain of the measure is the natural numbers. Indeed, it can be the case that intermediate values cannot be attained.Example 11. Consider Iη which has the codomain [0, 1] as each value Iη(K) can be associated with a probability value, cf. Table 1. In Knight [17] it has already been shown that Iη(K) is always a rational number, so 2/2 /∈ Im Iη.4 Furthermore, the possible values of Iη are further constrained when considering specific subclasses from above. For example, for every arbitrary knowledge base K which contains at most 2 formulas, the only possible values of Iη(K) are 0, 1/2, 1, so we have C f (Iη, 2) = 3.√We now come to the main contribution of this paper, which is a thorough study of the 16 considered inconsistency measures in terms of our four proposed expressivity characteristics.Theorem 1. The α-characteristics Cα(I, n) (α ∈ { f , v, l, p}) for the inconsistency measures Id, IMI, Idalal, I maxI(cid:2)dalal, ID f , IPm , Imv , and Inc are as shown in Table 3.dalal, I hitMIC , Iη, Ic , IL Pm , Imc , Ip , Ihs, The complete proof of the above theorem can be found in Appendix A. However, some of these proofs provide some interesting insights into the behavior of particular inconsistency measures and provide relations to other specific mathemat-ical branches. Therefore, we will discuss these insights in more detail in the following subsections before we continue with the actual discussion on comparing expressivity in Section 5.4.1. Sperner families and minimal inconsistent setsMany of the inconsistency measures discussed above use the notion of minimal inconsistent subset as a central tool for assessing the inconsistency of a knowledge base. In its simplest implementation, the inconsistency measure IMI is defined to be exactly the number of the minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base. Accordingly, in order to determine the number C f (IMI, n) it is necessary to investigate how many different minimal inconsistent subsets a knowledge base with nformulas may possess. This question has already been investigated from a more abstract perspective in set theory under the notion of Sperner families (also called independent systems).Definition 21. Let S = {S1, . . . , Sn} with n ≥ 1 be a family of sets over a set X (cid:16)= ∅, i.e., S i ⊆ X for all i = 1, . . . , n. The family S is called a Sperner family over X if for all S, S(cid:14) ∈ S with S (cid:16)= S, S (cid:3) S.(cid:14)(cid:14)4 Im fis the image of a function f .M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151133In other words, S is a Sperner family if none of its elements is contained in another. It can easily be seen that for every it cannot hold would not be a minimal inconsistent set. Note that a consistent knowledge base yields MI(K) = ∅inconsistent knowledge base K the set MI(K) is also a Sperner family over K: for M, MM ⊆ Mwhich is not covered by the above definition.(cid:14) ∈ MI(K) with M (cid:16)= M, otherwise MAs MI(K) is a Sperner family over K its maximal cardinality is bounded by the maximal cardinality of any Sperner family (cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)over K. For the latter we have the following result.Theorem 2. (See [28].) Let X be a set with n = | X|.1. There is a Sperner family Smax over X with |Smax| =2. For every Sperner family S (cid:14)over X , |S(cid:14)| ≤ |Smax|.(cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20).5(cid:14) |K|(cid:15)(cid:19)|K|/2(cid:20)A corollary of the above theorem is that |MI(K)| ≤|MI(K)| is always a non-negative integer we can directly entail C f (IMI, n) ≤that a consistent knowledge base K yields IMI(K) = 0, which is not covered by the above theorem).Interestingly, the set MI(K) is not only a Sperner family, but every Sperner family can be represented as MI(K) of some knowledge base K. Let X = {α1, . . . , αn} be any set and let S be a Sperner family over X . Consider a propositional signature At = {a1, . . . , an} where each proposition ai ∈ At corresponds to the element αi ∈ X . Consider now a knowledge base KSfor every knowledge base K. Also taking into account that + 1 (the addition of 1 is due to the fact (cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)n= {φ1, . . . , φn} defined via(cid:16)(cid:17)φi = ai ∧¬a jM∈S,αi ∈Mα j ∈M\{αi }for i = 1, . . . , n. Every φi states that ai is accepted and for each set M in S which contains αi at least one of the other elements must not be accepted. Thus, every φi lists the conditions under which any set containing αi does not contain an element of the Sperner family.Example 12. Let X = {α, β, γ , δ} be a set and consider the Sperner family S = {S1, S2, S3} over X defined viaS1 = {β, γ , δ}S2 = {α, β}S3 = {α, γ }Consider now the signature At = {a, b, c, d} where the proposition a corresponds to α, b to β, c to γ , and d to δ. Then KS4= {φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4} is defined viaφ1 = a ∧ ¬b ∧ ¬cφ2 = b ∧ (¬c ∨ ¬d) ∧ ¬aφ3 = c ∧ (¬b ∨ ¬d) ∧ ¬aφ4 = d ∧ (¬b ∨ ¬c)For example, φ3 states that if some set S contains γ (c), either not β or not δ (¬b ∨ ¬d), and not α (¬a), then S does not contain any element of S.By construction, it follows that M = {αk1 , . . . , αkm} (for some k1, . . . , km ∈ {1, . . . , n}) is an element of the Sperner family S if and only if the set {φk1 , . . . , φkm} is a minimal inconsistent subset of KS= {φ1, . . . , φn}.nExample 13. We continue Example 12 and consider S1 = {β, γ , δ} ∈ S. The set S1 corresponds to the set {φ2, φ3, φ4} ⊆ KSwith4φ2 = b ∧ (¬c ∨ ¬d) ∧ ¬aφ3 = c ∧ (¬b ∨ ¬d) ∧ ¬aφ4 = d ∧ (¬b ∨ ¬c)As one can see {φ2, φ3, φ4} is also a minimal inconsistent subset of KSKS4 . Further, the set of minimal inconsistent subsets of 4 is indeedMI(KS4 ) = {{φ2, φ3, φ4}, {φ1, φ2}, {φ1, φ3}}which is in direct correspondence to S.5 Smax can be constructed by taking the set of all subsets S ⊆ X with |S| = (cid:19)n/2(cid:20).134M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151From these observations it follows that IMI(KSn )| = |S|. Observe that if S is a Sperner family over X and S ∈ S then S \ {S} is also a Sperner family over X (provided that it is non-empty). Then for a set X with | X| = n and (cid:15)(cid:14)we can define a Sperner family Si over X with |Si| = i. This means in our setting, for every for every i = 1, . . . , n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:14)we can define a knowledge base K with |K| = n such that IMI(K) = i. Together with the fact that 0 is also i = 1, . . . , n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)a possible value of IMI we obtain C f (IMI, n) =n ) = |MI(KSFurthermore, also the set of maximal consistent subsets MC(K) of a knowledge base K form a Sperner family over K, is almost the same as C f (IMI, n) (please see Appendix A for the (cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)(cid:14)+ 1.(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)which is the reason why the value C f (Imc, n) =detailed proof of C f (Imc, n) =(cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)).4.2. Monotone Boolean functions and minimal inconsistent setsAnother interesting observation is the relation of the measures Imonotone Boolean functions of n variables [29]. Let us recall some basics on Boolean functions.MIC and ID f with the number (cid:14)(n) of profiles of Definition 22. A Boolean function f of n variables (n ∈ N0) is a function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1}.Let B(n) be the set of all Boolean functions of n variables. It can easily be seen that |B(n)| = 22n.Definition 23. A Boolean function f of n variables (n ∈ N0) is monotone if for every i = 1, . . . , n we havef (x1, . . . , xi−1, 0, xi+1, . . . , xn) ≤ f (x1, . . . , xi−1, 1, xi+1, . . . , xn)Let M B(n) be the set of all monotone Boolean functions of n variables. Obviously |M B(n)| ≤ |B(n)|. However, no closed form for m(n) = |M B(n)|—which is also called Dedekind number6 [3]—is known and only values up to n = 8 could be determined yet, cf. [29]. The Dedekind number m(n) has also a meaning in the context of Sperner families (see previous subsection). In fact, m(n) is also the number of different Sperner families over a set X with | X| = n.For the issue of analyzing inconsistency measures, the Dedekind number m(n) itself is not directly applicable as it is somewhat syntax-sensitive. More precisely, consider the set X = {α, β, γ } and the two Sperner families {{α, β}} and {{β, γ }}. Each of these families count one in the Dedekind number m(3). From the perspective of inconsistency measurement, the sets of minimal inconsistent subsets MI(K1) = {{α, β}} and MI(K2) = {{α, γ }} for some knowledge bases K1, K2 ∈ K f (3) are indistinguishable for all inconsistency measures solely based on utilizing minimal inconsistent sets. While for IMI only the number of minimal inconsistent sets is important, even for more elaborate measures such as IMIC and ID f these sets are equivalent as they coincide in both the number of minimal inconsistent sets and the cardinalities of each of those. Recall that in order to define the measure ID f we defined for a knowledge base K the setsMI(i)(K) = {M ∈ MI(K) | |M| = i}for i = 1, . . . , |K|. Given these values, we can also redefine the inconsistency measure IMIC viaIMIC (K) =|K|(cid:3)i=1|MI(i)(K)|iLet us call profile(K) = (|MI(1)(K)|, . . . , |MI(|K|)(K)|) ∈ N|K|MIC depends only on profile(K) and not the actual structure of the minimal inconsistent subsets.7 However, this property of indifference has a corresponding property in the context of Boolean functions.the MI-profile of K. One can see that I0Definition 24. Two Boolean functions f 1, f 2 of n variables (n ∈ N0) are equivalent, denoted by f 1 ∼ f 2, if there is a permu-tation σ : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} such thatf 1(x1, . . . , xn) = f 2(xσ (1), . . . , xσ (n))for all x1, . . . , xn ∈ {0, 1}.Let M B(n)/∼ be the quotient set of M B(n) wrt. ∼, i.e.M B(n)/∼ = {[ f ]∼| f ∈ M B(n)}6 See also http://oeis.org/A000372.7 The same holds for ID f as an MI-profile (MI0(K), . . . , MIn(K)) also uniquely determines the corresponding CN-profile (CN0(K), . . . , CNn(K)).M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151135(cid:14) ∼ f }. Then (cid:14)(n) is defined as where [ f ]∼ is the equivalence class (also called profile) of f , i.e., [ f ]∼ = { f(cid:14)(n) = |M B(n)/∼|, i.e., (cid:14)(n) is the number of profiles of monotone Boolean functions of n variables. As for the Dedekind number m(n), no closed form for (cid:14)(n) is known [29].8 However, we can observe an intriguing relationship of this number to inconsistency measures via(cid:14) ∈ M B(n) | f(cid:14)(n) = |{profile(K) | K ∈ K f (n)}|In other words, the number of different MI-profiles of knowledge bases of size n is the same as the number of profiles of monotone Boolean functions of n variables. In order to see this, recall that there is a one-to-one correspondence of MI(K) with Sperner families. It has already been mentioned that there is also a relationship between Sperner families and monotone Boolean functions. More precisely, let S be any Sperner family over X = {a1, . . . , an} and define a Boolean function fS via(cid:2)fS (x1, . . . , xn) =1 if ∃S ∈ S : S ⊆ {ai | xi = 1}0 otherwise(1)for all x1, . . . , xn ∈ {0, 1}. In other words, the function fS (x1, . . . , xn) evaluates to 1 if there is a member S ∈ S such that the corresponding variables of the elements of S are 1. Observe that fS is monotone for every Sperner family S. Moreover, it can also be seen that for every monotone Boolean function f there is a uniquely determined Sperner family S such that f = fS . Consider now two monotone Boolean functions f 1, f 2 with f 1 ∼ f 2. Then these correspond to two Sperner families S1, S2 over X , where S2 can be obtained from S1 by only permuting the elements of X . The only invariant between the Sperner families corresponding to the functions in [ f ]∼ is the number of sets in each, and the sizes of each set. In the context of minimal inconsistent sets, this means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between any MI-profile and an equivalence class [ f ]∼, leading to Equation (1).For the specific case of IMIC it has to be observed that the assignment of an MI-profile to the inconsistency value is not injective, i.e., there may be more than one MI-profile that is mapped to the same inconsistency value.Example 14. Consider the knowledge bases K3, K4 ∈ K f (5) defined viaK3 = {a, ¬a, b, c, d}K4 = {a, b, c, ¬a ∨ ¬b ∨ ¬c, ¬(a ∧ b ∧ c)}Here we haveMI(K3) = {{a, ¬a}}MI(K4) = {{a, b, c, ¬a ∨ ¬b ∨ ¬c}, {a, b, c, ¬(a ∧ b ∧ c)}}and thereforeprofile(K3) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)profile(K4) = (0, 0, 0, 2, 0)yielding IMIC (K3) = IMIC (K4) = 1/2.This behavior is the reason that (cid:14)(n) is only an upper bound for C f (IMIC , n) in Theorem 1. As for m(n) and (cid:14)(n), no closed form for C f (IMIC , n) could be found in our investigation. Using a computational brute-force approach we could however determine the first five values for C f (IMIC , n) (n = 1, . . . , 5) which are listed in Table 4 together with their cor-responding upper bounds (cid:14)(n). The measure IMIC is quite simplistic in its way to aggregate an MI-profile into a single inconsistency measure. A more elaborated measure is ID f (see Definition 5) where this aggregation is more fine-grained. For this measure, we obtain C f (IMIC but still bounded by (cid:14)(n). Note again that Definition 5 represents only a single instance of a more general family of inconsistency measures presented by Mu et al. [25]. Using an injective function h from the set of MI-profiles to real numbers one can instantiate this family with an instance I(cid:14), n) = (cid:14)(n).9 In any case, (cid:14)(n) is always an upper D fbound for every measure following the paradigm of ID f .where we could actually have C f (I(cid:14)D fMIC , n) ≤ C f (ID f , n) ≤ (cid:14)(n), i.e., ID fis more expressive than I8 See also http://oeis.org/A220880.9 Note that injective functions of the form h : Nk → R do indeed exist for arbitrary (and infinite) k but require complex constructions. However, it is questionable whether there are instances that would lead to meaningful inconsistency measures.136M.

Knight’s inconsistency measure and the Farey seriesLet us now turn to another interesting relationship, namely that of the inconsistency measure Iη [17] with the Farey series.10,11 The latter is defined as the series of numbers generated by the function (cid:5) : N → N defined via(cid:5)(x) = |{k/l | l = 1, . . . , x, k = 0, . . . , l}|for all x ∈ N. In other words, (cid:5)(x) is the number of different fractional expressions in [0, 1] with maximal denominator x(where both nominator and denominator are natural numbers). For example, for x = 3 we have(cid:2)01,11,02,12,22,03,13,23,33(cid:9)(cid:2)=0,(cid:9)13,12,23, 1yielding (cid:5)(3) = 5. Let us now recall the measure Iη which is defined asIη(K) = 1 − max{ξ | ∃P ∈ P(At) : ∀α ∈ K : P (α) ≥ ξ }for every K ∈ K. So in order to determine Iη(K) we are seeking a probability function P ∈ P(At) that maximizes the minimum probability it assigns to formulas in K. For the remainder of this section, let P K be any probability function that maximizes the minimum probability of all formulas of K, i.e., we have Iη(K) = 1 − ξK with ξK = min{P K(α) | α ∈ K}.A first observation one can make about P K and Iη—which also sets it apart from many other inconsistency measures—is that it does not care for the syntactic representation of formulas. More precisely, for any knowledge base K, formulas φ, φ(cid:14)we have Iη(K ∪ {φ}) = Iη(K ∪ {φ(cid:14)}) as P (φ) = P (φ(cid:14)) for every probability function. Moreover, we also have Iη(K ∪ {φ}) = Iη(K ∪ {φ, φ(cid:14)}) for the same reason; adding syntactic variations of already present formulas does not change the inconsistency value. It follows that we can identify every formula φ ∈ K with its set of models Mod(φ) in all matters related to determining Iη(K). By abusing notation we therefore can rewrite K aswith φ ≡ φ(cid:14)K(cid:14) = {Mod(φ) | φ ∈ K} ⊆ P((cid:4)(At))where P( X) is the power set of a set X and At is the signature of the underlying propositional language. Assume that At = {a1, . . . , an}, then (cid:4)(At) has 2n elements and every Mod(φ) is a subset of those.Let us first consider the question of how K(cid:14)and K could look like if we want to have ξK(cid:14) = k/l for l ∈ {1, . . . , 2n}and k ∈ {1, . . . , l}. Consider an arbitrary set {ω1, . . . , ωl} ⊆ (cid:4)(At) of interpretations (as l ≤ 2n there are enough different interpretations) and define P K(cid:14) (ω) = 1/l for all ω ∈ {ω1, . . . , ωl} and P K(cid:14) (ω(cid:14)) = 0 for all remaining ω(cid:14). Then P K(cid:14) is indeed a probability function that assigns equal probability to all {ω1, . . . , ωl}. Then define a formula φ in such a way that Mod(φ)is any k-element subset of {ω1, . . . , ωl}. Then we obtain P K(φ) = k/l. Populating K with all φ that can be defined as such, we obtain a knowledge base K with ξK = k/l.Example 15. Consider the propositional signature At3 = {a1, a2, a3}, i.e., we have n = 3 and 2n = 8. Choose ξK(cid:14) = 5/6 (note that 6 ∈ {1, . . . , 8} and 5 ∈ {1, . . . , 6}) and consider the following 6 interpretations ω1, . . . , ω6 ∈ (cid:4)(At3):ω1 = a1a2a3ω4 = a1a2a3ω2 = a1a2a3ω5 = a1a2a3ω3 = a1a2a3ω6 = a1a2a3The following sets M1, . . . , M6 are all 5-element subsets of ω1, . . . , ω6:M1 = {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5}M3 = {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω5, ω6}M5 = {ω1, ω3, ω4, ω5, ω6}M2 = {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4, ω6}M4 = {ω1, ω2, ω4, ω5, ω6}M6 = {ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5, ω6}10 See http://oeis.org/A005728 for more information on the Farey series.11 The measure IL Pm also has a relationship with the Farey series via C v (IL Pm , n) = (cid:5)(n), but it is quite straightforwardly explained. See the proof of Theorem 1 for details.M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151137Consider formulas φi with Mod(φi) = Mi for i = 1, . . . , 6. For example, we have φ1 = a1 ∨ (a2 ∧ a3). For the knowledge base K = {φ1, . . . , φ6} consider the probability function P K with P K(ω1) = . . . = P K(ω6) = 1/6 and P (ω) = 0 for ω ∈(cid:4)(At3) \ {ω1, . . . ω6}. By construction we have P K(φ1) = . . . = P K(φ6) = 5/6. Note also that there cannot be any other probability function that gives larger probability to all formulas.So given a signature At = {a1, . . . , an} and any l ∈ {1, . . . , 2n} and k ∈ {1, . . . , l} we can construct a knowledge base K such that ξK = k/l (and therefore Iη(K) = 1 − k/l). This gives us C v (Iη, n) ≥ (cid:5)(2n).The remaining question is whether there are numbers x ∈ [0, 1] that are not of the form x = k/l with l ∈ {1, . . . , 2n} and k ∈ {1, . . . , l} and for which a knowledge base K can be found such that ξK = x. Knight already showed in Knight [17] that ξK must always be a rational number in the unit interval, so it is clear that x = p/q for some p, q ∈ N with p ≤ q. So what about e.g. x = 1/(2n + 1)? It can be shown (see the complete proof in Appendix A) that due to combinatorial reasons a value such as 1/(2n + 1) cannot be attained for ξK if the underlying signature has n elements. For example, the uniform probability function P with P (ω) = 1/2n already yields P (φ) ≥ 1/2n for every formula φ ∈ K as it has at least one model (note that if K contains a contradictory formula we always have ξK = 0).Although the expressivity of Iη is characterized by (cid:5)(2n) it has to be noted that (cid:5)(2n) increases quite rapidly which makes Iη a quite expressive inconsistency measure (see Section 5).4.4. Normal forms for knowledge basesMany proofs of statements in Theorem 1 (in particular those showing infinite characteristics) involve the construction of dalal, n) = ∞ (for n > 1). dalal is defined by determining an interpretation ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) such that each formula φ ∈ K has minimal distance dalal is the particular families of knowledge bases that exhibit extreme inconsistency values, such as for C f (I(cid:2)Recall that I(cid:2)to ω (measured in the number of propositions that have to be flipped in ω order to obtain a model of φ). Then I(cid:2)sum of all these distances.In the proof of C f (I(cid:2)dalal, n) = ∞ (for n > 1) the following family of knowledge bases Ki is used:K1i= {a1 ∧ . . . ∧ ai, ¬a1 ∧ . . . ∧ ¬ai}for i ∈ N. Note that each K1i consists of only two formulas but the number of mentioned propositions increases with increasing i. It can be seen that for every interpretation ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) the sum of its distances to both formulas amounts to exactly i, i.e., I(cid:2)i ) = i and for i → ∞ we obtain I(cid:2)i ) → ∞ and thus C f (I(cid:2)Constructions such as the above can be used to characterize normal forms of knowledge bases for inconsistency measures. dalal, n) = ∞.dalal(K1dalal(K1For example, the above family K1ifor i ∈ N exhaustively describes the image of I(cid:2)dalal, i.e.,Im I(cid:2)= {I(cid:2)dalal(K10), I(cid:2)dalal(K11), I(cid:2)dalal(K12), . . .}dalalNote that K1= ∅. Every other knowledge base can be transformed into one of these knowledge bases while retaining its 0inconsistency value. While this transformation, of course, does not maintain semantic equivalence (even in a paraconsistent context), it can be used for illustration purposes. In each K1i the inconsistency is boiled down to its essential core as it is measured by I(cid:2)dalal. Inspecting this normal form, instead of the original knowledge base where the inconsistency might be obfuscated, can lead to better understanding of the severity of the inconsistency. We leave a deeper investigation of this matter for future work.4.5. About the distinction between {α, β} and {α ∧ β}By studying Table 3 it can be observed that almost all inconsistency measures have trivial characteristic values, i.e., a value of ∞, wrt. Cl and C p , and the characteristics C v and C f seem to be much better suited for assessing the expressivity. The reason for this is that for many inconsistency measures some conjunctions α ∧ β can be replaced by two distinct formulas α and β without decreasing the inconsistency value, so large inconsistency values can be attained by either having few long formulas or many short formulas. As Cl and C p only consider the formula-length as fixed (or the number of propositions per formula), arbitrary different inconsistency values can be attained by considering arbitrary large knowledge dalal. Recall that the measure I maxbases. The only exception, besides the drastic inconsistency measure Id , is the measure I maxdalalis defined as the maximal distance of an optimally chosen ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) to each formula of the knowledge base. If formulas are short, i.e., they each mention only few propositions, this distance is bounded, independently of the number of formulas in the knowledge base.The important distinction between a set of formulas {α, β} and the conjunction α ∧ β has already been recognized within e.g. the fields of inconsistent-tolerant reasoning and belief revision [18,4]. For example, in the context of contracting from a knowledge base K5 = {a, b} the inference a, the usually accepted result should be K5 − a = {b}. However, contracting from a knowledge base K6 = {a ∧ b} the inference a would result in K6 − a = ∅. More generally, a conjunction α ∧ β establishes a relationship between the formulas α and β and stipulates that they have to appear together (if one does not appear then the other one should also not appear). For a more detailed discussion see [18,4].138M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151Our study on the characteristics Cl and C p (for details see the proofs in Appendix A) shows that many inconsistency mea-sures do not recognize this difference and, moreover, behave quite incoherently in the general case of adding either separate formulas or a conjunction of the formulas to a knowledge base. Consider the following three properties for inconsistency measures. Let I be an inconsistency measure, K ∈ K, and φ, ψ ∈ L(At) be arbitrary.∧-Indifference I(K ∪ {α, β}) = I(K ∪ {α ∧ β}).∧-Penalty I(K ∪ {α, β}) ≤ I(K ∪ {α ∧ β}).∧-Mitigation I(K ∪ {α, β}) ≥ I(K ∪ {α ∧ β}).Note that Besnard [2] proposed ∧-Indifference under the name Adjunction Invariancy as a desirable property. However, we do not aim to discuss which (if any) of these properties may be desirable.But interestingly, only very few of the discussed measures satisfy any of them.Theorem 3.1. The measures Id, Ic , and IL Pm satisfy ∧-Indifference, ∧-Penalty, and ∧-Mitigation.2. The measures Iη, Ihs, and I max3. The measures I hit4. None of the measures IMI, Idalal and IPm satisfy ∧-Mitigation, but not ∧-Penalty.dalal satisfy ∧-Penalty, but not ∧-Mitigation.MIC , Imc , Ip , I(cid:2)dalal, ID f , Imv , Inc satisfies any of ∧-Indifference, ∧-Penalty, or ∧-Mitigation.As a consequence, the inconsistency values for many measures change quite arbitrarily when a conjunction α ∧ β is replaced by it conjuncts α and β.Example 16. Consider the knowledge base K7 given viaK7 = {a, ¬a}andMI(K7) = {{a, ¬a}}MI(K7 ∪ {a, b}) = {{a, ¬a}}MI(K7 ∪ {a ∧ b}) = {{a, ¬a}, {a ∧ b, ¬a}}MI(K7 ∪ {a ∧ ¬a, ¬¬a}) = {{a, ¬a}, {¬a, ¬¬a}, {a ∧ ¬a}}MI(K7 ∪ {a ∧ ¬a ∧ ¬¬a}) = {{a, ¬a}, {a ∧ ¬a ∧ ¬¬a}}(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)As one can see, the set MI(K) may change quite differently when adding separate formulas or conjunctions to K. In Equations (3) and (4) the addition of a conjunction leads to more minimal inconsistent sets than the addition of sep-arate formulas. In Equations (5) and (6) it is exactly the other way around. It follows that for measures I based on minimal inconsistent subsets—such as IMI—there is no general relationship such as I(K ∪ {α, β}) ≤ I(K ∪ {α ∧ β}) or I(K ∪ {α, β}) ≥ I(K ∪ {α ∧ β}) for arbitrary knowledge bases K and formulas α and β.5. Expressivity ordersLet us now come back to the original motivation of comparing inconsistency measures wrt. their expressivity. Defini-tion 20 provides the basis for a comparative analysis of inconsistency measures wrt. their expressivity, which we address with the following definition.Definition 25. An inconsistency measure I is at least as expressive as an inconsistency measure I(cid:14), if there is n0 ∈ N such that for all n > n0, Cα(I, n) ≥ Cα(I(cid:14), n).(α ∈ { f , v, l, p}), denoted by I (cid:26)α I(cid:14)wrt. a characteristic CαIf both I (cid:26)α I(cid:14)we write I (cid:27)α I(cid:14)and I(cid:14) (cid:26)α I, we say that I and I(cid:14). If I (cid:26)α I(cid:14)but not I ∼α I(cid:14)). Note that the expressivity order (cid:26) is not to be confused with the refinement order (cid:28) sometimes used for pairwise comparisons of inconsistency measures, see e.g. [31]. The refinement order (cid:28) is defined as I1 (cid:28) I2 iff I2(K) ≥ I2(K(cid:14)) implies I1(K) ≥ I1(K(cid:14)) for all K, K(cid:14). If I1 (cid:28) I2 this means that I2 is a refinement of I1. Note that (cid:26)α compares measures in a quantitative way and also allows comparison of measures that induce totally different orders on knowledge bases. However, it is also easy to see that I1 (cid:28) I2 implies I2 (cid:26)α I1 (for all α ∈ { f , v, l, p}).are equally expressive wrt. Cα and denote this by I ∼α I(cid:14)(I is strictly more expressive than I(cid:14)By exploiting the results from Theorem 1 we obtain the following simple corollary.M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151139Fig. 1. Expressivity orders of the investigated inconsistency measures; measures within the same box are equally expressive wrt. the particular expressivity characteristic.Corollary 1. The expressivity orders wrt. α-characteristics Cα(I, n) (α ∈ { f , v, l, p}) for the inconsistency measures Id, IMI, Idalal, ID f , IPm , Imv , and Inc are as shown in Fig. 1.Ic , IL Pm , Imc , Ip , Ihs, I(cid:2)dalal, I maxdalal, I hitMIC , Iη, The proof of the above corollary is omitted as the results follow directly from Theorem 1.In Fig. 1 the order (cid:27) f does not show the placement of the measures ID f , IMIC , and Iη as we only provided upper bounds for the corresponding characteristics in Theorem 1. However, we can give the following partial classification.Corollary 2. For I ∈ {Ic, IL Pm , I(cid:2)dalal, I maxdalal, IPm , Imv }, I (cid:27) f ID f , I (cid:27) f IMIC , I (cid:27) f Iη.The proof of the above corollary is straightforward as, e.g., we provided a finite bound for C f (Iη, n) (for every n) while C f (Ic, n) is unbounded. Empirical evidence suggests also the following relationships, but a formal proof has yet to be found.Conjecture 1. ID f(cid:27) f IMIC (cid:27) f Iη (cid:27) f IMI.Fig. 1 shows that the measures I(cid:2)dalal and IPm are the only measures that have maximal expressivity wrt. all four expres-sivity characteristics (among the considered inconsistency measures) and, as expected, the drastic inconsistency measure Id is the least expressive one. One can also observe that for many measures their positioning in the orders (cid:27)v and (cid:27)p is complementary, i.e., if a measure has high expressivity wrt. C fit has low expressivity wrt. C v (consider e.g. Ic and Ip ). This is due to the fact that many measures measure only a specific aspect of inconsistency and usually belong either to the MI-based family of inconsistency measures—which focus on using minimal inconsistent subsets for measuring—or the variable-based family—which focus on conflicting propositions—, cf. [12]. Therefore, they are constrained in their expressiv-ity if one of these dimensions is limited. For example, if the number of formulas in a knowledge base is restricted, so is the number of minimal inconsistent subsets.Again, it should be noted that expressivity characteristics are meant to complement the investigation of rationality postu-lates, not to replace them. Rationality postulates are important to analyze the meaningfulness of the values of inconsistency measures, while our characteristics provide a quantitative assessment of their expressivity. However, we believe that the concept of expressivity characteristics and the results reported in this work will nurture general comparative analyses of inconsistency measures.The expressivity characteristics considered in this paper each tackle one specific aspect of size of a knowledge base. Of course, one can also combine these characteristics to obtain hybrid versions viaCα,α(cid:14)(I, n, m) = |{I(K) | K ∈ Kα(n) ∩ Kα(cid:14)(m)}|with α, α(cid:14) ∈ {v, f , l, p}, α (cid:16)= α(cid:14), and n, m > 0. For example, C v, f (I, n, m) is the number of different inconsistency values on knowledge bases which mention at most n propositions and consist of at most m formulas. A simple observation on these new characteristics is the following one.Proposition 1. Let α, α(cid:14) ∈ {v, f , l, p}, α (cid:16)= α(cid:14), and n, m > 0. ThenCα,α(cid:14)(I, n, m) ≤ min{Cα(I, n), Cα(cid:14)(I, m)}The proof of the above proposition is straightforward. An investigation of these hybrid and other characteristics—and the resulting expressivity orders—is left for future work.140M.

Summary and conclusionWe conducted a focused but extensive comparative analysis of 16 inconsistency measures from the recent literature in terms of their expressivity. For that, we introduced 4 different expressivity characteristics and conducted an analytical evalu-ation of the considered measures wrt. these expressivity characteristics. Our findings revealed some interesting relationships of inconsistency measures to, e.g., set theory and monotone Boolean functions. Finally, the measures I(cid:2)dalal [8] and IPm [16]have been proven to be maximally expressive wrt. all our characteristics.Expressivity characteristics provide a novel evaluation method for assessing the quality of inconsistency measures. It has to be noted again, however, that high expressivity alone is not a sufficient criterion for doing this. It is straightforward to construct measures that exhibit maximal expressivity along all discussed dimensions, but fail to comply with the intuitions one expects from inconsistency measures. The use of rationality postulates—such as the ones presented and discussed in Hunter and Konieczny [11]; Mu et al. [25]; Besnard, [2]—must still serve as first-level evaluation criterion. If measures satisfy the same (or a similar set of) rationality postulates, expressivity can be used to make further quality assessments.To the best of our knowledge, our work is the most extensive comparative analysis of inconsistency measures so far. All inconsistency measures discussed in this paper have been implemented and an online interface to try out these measures is available.12AcknowledgementsI thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments to improve a previous version of this paper.Appendix A.

Let n > 0 except in proofs regarding Cl where n > 1 is assumed (note that Cl(I, 1) = 1 for every measure I as every K ∈ Kl(1) does not contain a negation and is therefore always consistent).1. C v (Id, n) = 2By definition, Id has co-domain {0, 1} and therefore C v (Id, n) ≤ 2. For the knowledge bases K8 = {a} and K9 = {a ∧ ¬a}we get Id(K8) = 0 and Id(K9) = 1 and therefore C v (Id, n) ≥ 2. As K8 and K9 use only one proposition the statement is true for all n > 0.12 http://tweetyproject.org/w/incmes/.M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–1511412.

Analogous to 1 but consider K8 = {a} and K7 = {a, ¬a}.Consider for i ∈ N the knowledge bases K2i= ∞. As each K2(cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)6. C f (IMI, n) =+ 1i only uses one proposition the statement is true for every n > 0.= {¬a, a, a ∧ a, a ∧ a ∧ a, . . . , (cid:18)ij=1 a}. Then IMI(K2i ) = i and limi→∞ IMI(K2i )Note that for every inconsistent knowledge base K the set MI(K) is a Sperner family of K, i.e. a set S of subsets from a set T for which X ⊆ Y for no two X, Y ∈ S. According to Sperner’s theorem the maximal cardinality (which is also [28]. If K is consistent we have MI(K) = ∅ and attained) of any Sperner family of a set T with |T | = n is (cid:15)IMI(K) = 0, yielding C f (IMI, n) ≤+ 1 we show that every Sperner family can be n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)represented through MI(K) of a knowledge base K. Let T = {α1, . . . , αn} be a set and define a propositional signature (cid:15)(cid:14)At = {a1, . . . , an}. Let S be any Sperner family of T with cardinality = {φ1, . . . , φn}n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)via(cid:15)(cid:14)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)(cid:14)+ 1. To show C f (IMI, n) ≥.

Informally, every φi states that ai is accepted and for each set M in S which contains αi at least one } (for some k1, . . . , km ∈ {1, . . . , n}) is an of the other elements must not be accepted. If follows that M = {αk1 , . . . , αkmn ) = |MI(KSelement of S if and only if the set {φk1 , . . . , φkmn )| =|S| =.

Together with the fact that 0 is also a possible value of IMI we obtain C f (IMI, n) ≥} is a minimal inconsistent set. It follows that IMI(KS+ 1.(cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)Note that n > 1 is assumed as trivially Cl(IMI, 1) = 1. Consider the family of knowledge bases K3i¬ai} for i ∈ N.

Observe that IMIC (K2i ) = i/2 and therefore C v (IMIC , n) = ∞.Consider the vector profile(K) = (MI0(K), . . . , MIn(K)), called MI-profile of K in the following, where MIi(K) is the set of i-size minimal inconsistent subsets of K. Note that every MI-profile induces the inconsistency value wrt. IMIC of its corresponding knowledge base by I|MIi(K)| · 1/i. Furthermore, note that two distinct MI-profiles may yield the same inconsistency value, e.g. (1, 0, 0) and (0, 2, 0) yield the same inconsistency value 1. It follows thatMIC (K) =(cid:6)ni=1C f (IMIC , n) ≤ |{(|MI0(K)|, . . . , |MIn(K)|) |(MI0(K), . . . , MIn(K)) is anMI-profile for some K ∈ K f (n)}|As discussed in 6, for every knowledge base K the set MI(K) is a Sperner family. It is well-known that there is an equivalence between Sperner families and monotone boolean functions, cf. [29]. In [29] the number of inequivalent monotone boolean functions has been investigated, see also http://oeis.org/A220880. These numbers are the same of inequivalent Sperner families as well. Here, two Sperner families MI(K) and MI(K(cid:14)) are equivalent if they yield the same MI-profiles. The number of different MI-profiles is also the number on the right-hand side of the above equation, thus showing the claim C f (IMIC , n) ≤ (cid:14)(n) where (cid:14)(n) is the number of inequivalent monotone Boolean functions on n variables.Note that n > 1 is assumed as trivially Cl(Iobserve that Ii ) = i/2 and therefore Cl(IMIC (K3MIC , n) = ∞.MIC , 1) = 1. Consider then the family of knowledge bases K3from 7 and iAnalogous to 11 (note that every formula in K3i mentions only one proposition).11. Cl(IMIC , n) = ∞12. C p(IMIC , n) = ∞13. C v (Iη, n) = (cid:5)(2n)We first show C v (Iη, n) ≤ (cid:5)(2n). In [17] it has already been shown that Iη(K) ∈ [0, 1] ∩ Q for every K (Definition 2.7 and Theorem 2.28). Hence, assume η = k/l and Iη(K) = 1 − η for k, l ∈ N and k ≤ l. We also assume for now that K142M. Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151contains no contradictory formula. Furthermore, we assume that K contains no free formulas (as Iη satisfies indepen-dence they have no influence on the inconsistency value, cf. [30]). Let P be a probability function such that P (φ) ≥ k/lfor all φ ∈ K. It can be assumed that there is no ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) such that P (ω) > 0 but ω (cid:16)|(cid:4) φ for every φ ∈ K (otherwise one could set P (ω) = 0 and distribute the “probability mass” P (ω) on the remaining interpretations which have al-ready a positive probability; this cannot change the fact that P (φ) ≥ k/l for all φ ∈ K). So for all ω ∈ (cid:4)(At), if P (ω) > 0then ω |(cid:4) φ for some φ ∈ K. Define FK(ω) = {φ ∈ K | ω |(cid:4) φ} for all ω ∈ (cid:4)(At), i.e., FK(ω) is the set of formulas in K that are satisfied by ω. We can furthermore assume that for all ω, ω(cid:14) ∈ (cid:4)(At) with P (ω) > 0 and P (ω(cid:14)) > 0 we have FK(ω) (cid:3) FK(ω(cid:14)) (otherwise we could set P (ω) = 0 and add the probability mass P (ω) to P (ω(cid:14)), without decreas-ing the probabilities of the formulas). Assume furthermore, that among all probability functions that satisfy the above constraints, P is one such that |{ω|P (ω) > 0}| is minimal.Now consider the case |{ω | P (ω) > 0}| = 2, i.e., there are two interpretations ω1, ω2 that receive positive probability. For every formula φ ∈ K, either φ ∈ FK(ω1), or φ ∈ FK(ω2), or φ ∈ FK(ω1) ∩ FK(ω2). Note that the latter case cannot be possible for all φ ∈ K as otherwise FK(ω1) = FK(ω2). Furthermore, there is one formula φ(cid:14) ∈ K with P (φ(cid:14)) = P (ω1)and one formula φ(cid:14)(cid:14) ∈ K with P (φ(cid:14)(cid:14)) = P (ω2), otherwise we would have FK(ω1) ⊆ FK(ω2) or FK(ω2) ⊆ FK(ω1). As P (φ) has to be maximal for all φ ∈ K we can conclude P (ω1) = P (ω2) and therefore η = 1/2.Now consider the case |{ω | P (ω) > 0}| = 3, i.e., there are three interpretations ω1, ω2, ω3 that receive positive proba-bility. For each φ ∈ K let (cid:19)P (φ) = {ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) | P (ω) > 0, ω |(cid:4) φ}, i.e., (cid:19)P (φ) is such that P (φ) =ω∈(cid:19)P (φ) P (ω). Note that it cannot be the case that |(cid:19)P (φ)| = 3 for any φ ∈ K (otherwise φ would be free in K) or that |(cid:19)P (φ)| = 0 (then φ would be self-contradictory). Consider the following sub-cases:(a) for all φ ∈ K we have |(cid:19)P (φ)| = 1:(cid:6)Then for all φ ∈ K we have P (φ) = P (ω) for some ω ∈ {ω1, ω2, ω3} and as there are no subset relations between any FK(ω1), FK(ω2), and FK(ω3), it follows that P (ω1) = P (ω2) = P (ω3) = 1/3 maximizes each probability and we have η = 1/3.(b) for all φ ∈ K we have |(cid:19)P (φ)| = 2:Then for all φ ∈ K we have P (φ) = P (ω) + P (ω(cid:14)) for some ω, ω(cid:14) ∈ {ω1, ω2, ω3} with ω (cid:16)= ω(cid:14)and as there are no sub-set relations between any FK(ω1), FK(ω2), and FK(ω3), it follows that P (ω1) = P (ω2) = P (ω3) = 1/3 maximizes each probability and we have η = 2/3.(c) otherwise:(cid:14)defined via P(cid:14)(ω1) = 0.5, PLet φ1 ∈ K with |(cid:19)P (φ1)| = 1. Without loss of generality assume (cid:19)P (φ1) = {ω1}. As FK(ω2) (cid:3) FK(ω1) there is φ2 ∈ FK(ω2) with φ2 /∈ FK(ω1). Consider the case that for all φ ∈ FK(ω3) either φ ∈ FK(ω1) or φ ∈ FK(ω2). Then (cid:14)(φ) ≥ 0.5 for all φ ∈ K. Assuming PP obtains a larger probability for all formulas implies that P (ω) > 0.5 (in order to have P (φ1) > 0.5), but then P (φ2) < 0.5. So we have a contradiction since P is supposed to be minimal wrt. |{ω|P (ω) > 0}|. It follows that there is φ3 ∈ FK(ω3) with φ3 /∈ FK(ω1) and φ3 /∈ FK(ω2), so P (φ3) = P (ω3). Similarly, it can be assumed that φ2 /∈FK(ω3) as well. As P (φ1) = P (ω1), P (φ2) = P (ω2), and P (φ3) = P (ω3) it follows that P (ω1) = P (ω2) = P (ω3) = 1/3maximizes each probability and we have η = 1/3.(cid:14)(ω) = 0 for all other ω yields P(cid:14)(ω2) = 0.5, and PSo for |{ω | P (ω) > 0}| = 3 we have that η ∈ {1/3, 2/3}. Inductively it follows that for |{ω | P (ω) > 0}| = h we have η ∈ {1/h, . . . , (h − 1)/h}. As a signature with n propositions has 2n different interpretations, and together with the cases of a consistent knowledge base (inconsistency value 0) and one that contains a contradictory formula (inconsistency value 1) we obtain C v (Iη, n) ≤ |{k/l | l = 1, . . . , 2n, k = 0, . . . , l}| = (cid:5)(2n).We now show that C v (Iη, n) ≥ (cid:5)(2n). For that let η = k/l for l ∈ {1, . . . , 2n} and k ∈ {1, . . . , l}. Let X = {ω1, . . . , ωl} ⊆(cid:4)(At) be any set of l different interpretations. Define P via P (ω) = 1/l if ω ∈ X and P (ω) = 0 otherwise. Define ˆK via φ ∈ ˆK if and only ifφ =(cid:17)ω∈ Xkφωwhere Xk is a k-element subset of X and φω is the complete conjunction that has ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) as its only model (note formulas, one for each k-element subset of X ). Observe that for all φ ∈ ˆK we havethat ˆK contains (cid:14)(cid:15)P (φ) = P (lk(cid:17)ω∈ Xkφω) =(cid:3)ω∈ XkP (φω) = k/land that this is obviously the maximal possible value for ˆK. It follows that Iη( ˆK) = 1 − k/l and therefore C v (Iη, n) ≥(cid:5)(2n).Analogous to 13. However, note that the maximal number of interpretations that may receive a positive probability is bounded by the number of different FK(ω) for ω ∈ (cid:4)(At). As the set of FK(ω) with P (ω) > 0 form a Sperner family (no two elements have a subset relation) the maximal cardinality of this set is , cf. [28].(cid:14)(cid:15)n(cid:19)n/2(cid:20)(cid:14)14.

For n = 2 observe that either Iη(K) = 0 (for consistent K) or Iη(K) = 0.5. For the latter, note that K can only be inconsistent if and only if there is at least one (possibly more) a ∈ Atsuch that a, ¬a ∈ K (or semantically equivalent formulas). Then any probability function P with P (φ) maximal for all φ ∈ K has to satisfy P (a) = P (¬a) = 0.5. Therefore we have Cl(Iη, 2) = 2. For n = 3 we additionally have the case that a three-element minimal inconsistent subset {¬a1, ¬a2, a1 ∨ a2} may occur with corresponding inconsistency value 1/3, thus Cl(Iη, n) = 3. For n > 3 consider the family of knowledge bases K4= {¬a1 ∨ a2, ¬a2 ∨ a3, . . . , ¬ai−1 ∨ ai, ¬ai ∧ a1}. i| = 1/i and therefore Cl(Iη, n) = ∞.i ) = 1/|K4Note that K4i16.

Then any probability function P with P (φ) maximal for all φ ∈ K has to satisfy P (a) = P (¬a) = 0.5. For n > 1 consider the family of knowledge bases K4is a minimal inconsistent set.

Together we obtain IL Pm (K) = Ic(K)/|At(K)| ∈ {k/l | l = 1, . . . , |At(K)|, k = 0, . . . , l} and therefore C f (IL Pm , n) ≤ (cid:5)(n) = |{k/l | l =1, . . . , n, k = 0, . . . , l}|.

C f (Imc, n) =Note first, that if K contains only self-contradictory formulas we have MC(K) = ∅. Otherwise, analogously to 6, observe that for every other consistent or inconsistent knowledge base K the set MC(K) is a Sperner family of K, i.e. a set Sof subsets from a set T for which X ⊆ Y for no two X, Y ∈ S. According to Sperner’s theorem the maximal cardinality [28]. Hence we have 0 ≤ |MC(K)| ≤(which is also attained) of any Sperner family of a set T with |T | = n is (cid:14)(cid:15)n. Also analogously to 6 observe that every value can be attained by some knowledge base. For that let S be (cid:19)n/2(cid:20)any Sperner family of cardinality (cid:19)n/2(cid:20) of a set T = {α1, . . . , αn}.

Thimm / Artificial Intelligence 234 (2016) 120–151Note that for |K| = n, 0 ≤ |SC(K)| ≤ n (and every value can be attained). However, we cannot simply obtain the value C f (Imc, n) by adding the upper bounds of |MC(K)| and |SC(K)| as these two values are dependent. Observe that if K with |K| = n contains a self-contradictory formula φ then φ cannot be part of any maximal consistent subset of K, i.e., we have MC(K) = MC(K \ {φ}). In general, we have that if K contains k contradictory formulas then |MC(K)| ≤(cid:14)(n−k)(cid:19)(n−k)/2(cid:20)and then we obtain the following characterization of C f (Imc, n):(cid:15)(n−k)(cid:19)(n−k)/2(cid:20).

For n = 1we obtain C f (Imc, n) = 2 (a knowledge base with one formula is either consistent, i.e., MC(K) = {K}, SC(K) = ∅, and thus Imc(K) = 0; or it is inconsistent with MC(K) = {∅}, SC(K) = K, and thus Imc(K) = 1). Note that either the empty set or the whole set are the only possible maximal consistent subsets. For n = 2 we obtain C f (Imc, n) = 3: either K is consistent (Imc(K) = 0), or it contains one self-contradictory formula (Imc(K) = 1), or it contains two contradictory formulas (Imc(K) = 2). Note that the maximal number of consistent subsets of K is 2 (for the case that K is a two-element minimal inconsistent set), but then there cannot be self-contradictory formulas and we have Imc(K) = 1. For n = 3 we obtain C f (Imc, n) = 4 (for a consistent knowledge base and knowledge bases with 1 to 3 self-contradictory formulas and one maximal consistent subset). Note that the maximal number of consistent subsets of K is 3, e.g. all two-element subsets, but then K cannot contain any self-contradictory formula and we have Imc(K) = 2which we can also obtain by having two self-contradictory formulas.

C v (Ihs, n) = 2n + 1Any hitting set can be of maximal size 2n as there are that many interpretations in a language with n propositions, and as a hitting set may not be defined in case of a contradictory formula we get C v (Ihs, n) ≤ 2n + 1. Let now Ati ={a1, . . . , ai be a propositional signature i propositions and consider the knowledge base K11= {φω | ω ∈ (cid:4)(Ati)} where iφω is any formula with Mod(φω) = {ω}.

For C f (Ihs, n) ≥ n + 1 consider a knowledge base with n pairwise inconsistent formulas, such as in 33 (note that the signature can be arbitrarily large). Therefore we get C f (Ihs, n) = n + 1.34.

Cl(I maxdalal, n) = (cid:19)(n + 7)/3(cid:20)dalal(K) = 0 or I maxdalal(K) = 1 and we have Cl(I maxNote that n > 1 is assumed as trivially Cl(I maxdalal, 1) = 1. For n = 2 observe that K only contains propositions or negations of propositions and therefore, the set of models of every formula of K has at most distance 1 to any interpretation. Therefore, I maxdalal, 2) = 2. For n = 3 observe that formulas may only have the form a, ¬a, a ∧ b, or a ∨ b for a, b ∈ At. Note that only the models of a formula a ∧ b may have distance 2 to some interpretation. However, as a conjunction cannot contain a negation, the minimal maximal distance of any formula from K is 1 as the models of e.g. ¬a has only distance 1 to any models of a ∧ b. As there can also be no contradictory formula (for that a length of 4 of a formula is required) we get Cl(I maxdalal, 3) = 2. For n = 4 consider the interpretation ω with ω(a) = true for every a ∈ (cid:4)(At). As every conjunction can contain at most one negation, the distance of the models of every formula to ω is also maximally 1. Additionally, we have self-contradictory formulas which yield in total Cl(I maxdalal, 4) = 3. Assume n > 4 with n = 2 + 3k with k > 0 and let φω be the complete conjunction that has ω ∈ (cid:4)(At) as its only model. Then observe that K11k ) = kk+1(and that smaller inconsistency values can be attained by removing some formula in K11). Observe further that for in ∈ {3 + 3k, 4 + 3k} the maximal distance cannot be larger than for n = 2 + 3k. Together with consistent knowledge bases and knowledge bases containing self-contradictory formulas we obtain Cl(I maxdalal, n) = (cid:19)(n − 2)/3(cid:20) + 3 = (cid:19)(n + 7)/3(cid:20)for n > 3.44.

Observe that each MI-profile (MI0(K), . . . , MIn(K)) also uniquely determines the corresponding CN-profile (CN0(K), . . . , CNn(K)). That is, there are no two knowledge bases K and K(cid:14)that have the same MI-profile but different CN-profiles. Then there cannot be more R-profiles (R 1(K), . . . , Rn(K)) than there are MI-profiles and, thus, the number of inequivalent monotone Boolean functions on n variables is also an upper bound for C f (ID f , n).51.

There-fore, we only show that Id and Ic satisfy ∧-Indifference.(a) Id: the statement follows directly from that fact that every knowledge base K ∪ {α, β} is inconsistent if and only if K ∪ {α ∧ β} is inconsistent.148M.

From Table 2 it follows that υ(α ∧ β) ∈ {T , B} and therefore υ |(cid:4)3 K ∪ {α ∧ β} as well. Note that the converse holds as well. Then we haveIc(K ∪ {α, β}) = min{|υ−1(B)| | υ |(cid:4)3 K ∪ {α, β}}= min{|υ−1(B)| | υ |(cid:4)3 K ∪ {α ∧ β}}= Ic(K ∪ {α ∧ β})(c) IL Pm : this follows directly from Ic satisfying ∧-Indifference and At(K ∪ {α, β}) = At(K ∪ {α ∧ β}).2.
