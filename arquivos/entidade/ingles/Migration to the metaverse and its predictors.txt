Implementation of these plans can become the next milestone on the road to the ongoing exodus from real places to digital ones. However, as any novel technology, the metaverse raises controversies and questions. Does one want to migrate to the metaverse? Does one’s willingness to move to virtual worlds depend on the bonds with existing virtual places and the sense of threat related to this technology? To address these questions, we drew on the theories of place attachment and intergroup threat. In two studies – (1) among users of open-world games (N = 366) and (2) using a sample representative of the Polish population in terms of age, gender and size of the residential place (N = 995) – we observed a low level of willingness to migrate to the metaverse. The participants displayed a high level of perceived metaverse-related threat, ranging from privacy concerns to the belief that metaverse can deprive one of access to essential human experiences. However, greater attachment to virtual, as opposed to real, places was associated with both an increased willingness to migrate to the metaverse and a low level of perceived threat. The results provide a better understanding of individuals’ perception of the metaverse and of how the bonds with virtual and real places translate into attitudes towards metaverse technology.    Introduction In recent years, virtual places have played an increasingly important role in human life (Barreda-Ángeles & Hartmann, 2022). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, people were spending increasingly more time in virtual worlds (Rzeszewski & Evans, 2020; Coulson et al., 2019). The metaverse is one of the technologies of the future that is generating a particular interest in the context of the potential further exodus of people from real places to digital ones. Referred to as the ‘new internet’, the metaverse is designed to become a virtual universe where people can receive entertainment, socialize or even work (Bojic, 2022; Oh et al., 2023). The feature that distinguishes the metaverse from its predecessor, the internet, the most is its capacity to be explored in a manner analogous to how we interact with real places, which is to be achieved primarily through further development of both virtual and augmented reality technologies that can either transfer users to a virtual location or integrate virtual elements into the real world. The concept of the metaverse has been around for three decades – the term dates back to the science fiction novel Snow Crash written by Neal Stephenson in 1992 – and some of the elements of the future virtual universe are already being widely used. For example, Second Life has allowed its users to create avatars to meet other players, buy and sell virtual real estate and do business (Boellstorff, 2015). These possibilities are being further enhanced by contemporary virtual chats, such as VRChat (Barreda-Ángeles & Hartmann, 2022), or sites, such as Decentraland and Sandbox (Goanta, 2020; Jeon et al., 2022). Moreover, the past several years have been marked by a boom of augmented-reality games, such as Pokemon-Go, which enable smartphone gamers to explore the real world in search of virtual elements, and at the same time, the quality and availability of virtual reality (VR) systems have increased significantly, which affects their progressive adoption (Barreda-Ángeles & Hartmann, 2022). However, despite the remarkable technological advancement, the public was introduced to the metaverse more recently, when major technology companies announced that they were beginning to work on creating their own versions of this technology, ranging from the enhancement of the current virtual worlds (e.g. Epic’s Fortnite and the Roblox ecosystem; Oh et al., 2023) to a more general and somewhat vague vision of the ‘next evolution of social connection’ (Zuckerberg, 2021). Although we still do not know what the most advanced implementations of the metaverse concept can look like, this technology can have the potential to significantly impact human interaction with the world. There is a lack of research on the predictors of the willingness to test this technology and the public concerns raised by it. Thus, we intend to fill this gap by focusing on users’ willingness to transfer a substantial amount of their daily activities to virtual worlds and its predictors. We hypothesise that greater acceptance of the development of the metaverse and willingness to use it is related to prior positive experiences of virtual places, primarily attachment to the currently used virtual places and the feeling that they can satisfy our needs more than real-world locations. Moreover, we expect that, as in the case of any new and evolving technology, the development of the metaverse will raise a number of concerns and questions. Building on the intergroup threat theory (Stephan & Stephan, 2017), we intend to examine whether the willingness to migrate to metaverse worlds is associated with two general types of threat: 1) realistic threat (e.g., fear of the loss of privacy, increased power of technology companies, loneliness of users or neglect of real places) and 2) symbolic threat (fears of how the technology can affect human nature and the bonds connecting humans to the real world). Considering the various existing definitions of the metaverse, this research will focus on users’ relationship to migration to the metaverse, understood as a three-dimensional, virtual world in which users can undertake most of the activities available in the real world through avatars. Virtual worlds as equivalent of real locations Places are natural conditions of human existence (Heidegger, 1962); however, the definition of a place remains an area of dispute among geographers, environmental psychologists and philosophers (Lewicka et al., 2019). The classic definitions of a place assume that it is a bounded entity with a unique identity and historical continuity, offering a haven and a break from the outside world (Relph, 1974). Other definitions stress that a place should instead be defined as a location with interactive potential, a meeting space rather than a separated enclave (Massey, 2004; Di Masso, 2012; Seamon, 2013). However, most researchers agree that a place, as opposed to a space, possesses a specific meaning for its inhabitants or visitors. Thus, a place is not a random location passed by but an object which people are connected to through their various life experiences. The emergence of virtual worlds has raised an important question for place theorists: What is the role of physicality in defining meaningful locations? Traditionally, places have been conceptualised by their tangibility and physical basis (Relph, 1976; Lewicka, 2011). However, current digital worlds can also provide a comfortable space for human dwelling (e.g. Rzeszewski & Evans, 2021). Currently, virtual environments can be comfortably accessed via one’s home on personal computers or smartphones, presenting an alternative world that can be perceived by the users as very real and changing the traditional ways of recreation, travel, social interactions and work (Plunkett, 2011). Therefore, physicality ceases to be a critical aspect that defines a place. Existing studies show that a lack of tangibility does not prevent virtual places from gaining meaning for their users. For example, Stoklos (2009) argues that virtual settings have several qualities of physical places (e.g. they afford social interaction and have symbolic meanings). Some scholars argue that it is crucial for the virtual world to gain meaning for it to be treated as a physical place (Plunkett, 2011; see also Tuan, 1974). However, the diminishing boundary between virtual and real places raises questions about the latter’s possible de-meaning and its consequences. For example, Gifford (2011) argues that human failure to rationally divide time between physical and virtual worlds can lead to decreased interest in real, local concerns. Similarly, Lewicka (2020) considers whether current social processes, including the virtualisation of everyday life, may involve undermining human relationships with the places they inhabit (see also Seamon, 2020). This problem was further emphasised during the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns and subsequent fear forced people to move many of their activities to virtual spaces (Barreda-Angeles & Hartmann, 2022). Thus, digital worlds served and continue serving as a functional alternative to temporarily unavailable options, steadily gaining popularity and new user bases (Paul et al., 2021). More individuals were able to test the possibilities offered by virtual worlds: for example, enacting different characters, exploring exciting places, shaping the space according to individual needs or simply enjoying safety from the pandemic and detachment from other everyday concerns (Paul et al., 2021). As a result, the rise of virtual worlds’ popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic forced human relationships with real places to weaken (Devine-Wright et al., 2020). Stay-at-home directives, social distancing and the feeling of coronavirus-related threats confined millions of people to their homes and displaced them from everyday locations that have meaning and serve to fulfil their material and psychological needs (e.g. Bick, Blandin, & Mertens, 2020; Honey-Roses et al., 2020). This alienation from places contributed to changes in the emotional connections that people have with their environments and had important consequences for their well-being (Cowden et al., 2021). What, then, can induce individuals to leave real places in favour of virtual worlds, such as the metaverse, to an even greater extent? Although migration to a virtual world is not equal to physical migration, it could be compared to fluid migrations because the costs of moving to this world are minimal and easily reversible (e.g. Coulson et al., 2019). Such migrations imply a temporary nature, frequent relocation and low transfer costs and largely replace the traditional one-way migration pattern (Salamońska & Czeranowska, 2021). Virtual migrations meet these criteria, radically decreasing the costs of mobility and reducing the time spent with the place of origin (in this case, the real-world place of living). We argue that in the context of the metaverse, the term ‘migration’ can be even more appropriate than in the case of current virtual places, as the metaverse, or at least some of its versions, is intended to provide an alternative place for living. This perception of metaverse is reflected in the media discourse, where terms, such as ‘migrating’ to or ‘living’ in the metaverse, are often used non-metaphorically (e.g. Oh et al., 2022; Ghlionn & Hamilton, 2022; Regan, 2022; Szaniawska-Schiavo, 2022). In our study, we hypothesise that perceived strong ties to existing virtual places, as well as weaker ties to real places, are associated with greater willingness to migrate to the metaverse. To investigate this phenomenon, we draw on previous research on one of the key factors describing human relationships with places, which is place attachment. Place attachment and migration to the metaverse Place attachment is broadly defined as an emotional, cognitive and behavioural bond that individuals develop with places (Lewicka, 2011). This bond can stem from various meanings, including individual experience, the length of residence and the historical or cultural significance of a place (Lewicka, 2011; Hernández et al., 2020). Place attachment has numerous beneficial consequences for human lives as it predicts well-being, stress reduction, perceived belongingness and the feeling of security (Lewicka, 2011). Moreover, a place can play an important role in maintaining self-esteem and self-efficacy (Twigerr-Ross & Uzzell, 1996). In particular, places can boost human self-esteem, for example, when living in a particular place is considered a source of pride, and individuals can derive a feeling of self-efficacy from the environment where they are able to perform desired everyday activities (Twigerr-Ross & Uzzell, 1996). These place functions induce people to want to keep in touch with places close to them. In many studies, place attachment is thought to increase one’s desire to stay in a particular place, thus hindering the decision to migrate. However, an important limitation of this approach is that it views place attachment as a static characteristic that defines the relationship between a person and a place in a one-dimensional way (Kim, 2021). Meanwhile, newer approaches emphasise that place attachment should be treated as a dynamic phenomenon subject to increase or decrease due to changes in place or life circumstances (Devine-Wright & Quinn, 2020). As a result of mobility, there are possibilities for developing attachment to multiple places simultaneously (Kim, 2021). However, mobility can also alter the strength of one’s attachment to previous and subsequent places of residence (Lewicka, 2020; Di Masso et al., 2019). Moreover, qualitative research (Trąbka, 2019) has shown that different aspects of place attachment to a new place emerge gradually, and the first to emerge is attachment based on the attractiveness of the place and the affordances it offers. Positive emotions associated with experiences in a new place can induce humans to feel comfortable and safe, which in turn can translate into a desire to continue exploring and enjoying the new opportunities provided by the place. This process can eventually lead to a stable, profound connection with the new place, combined with the belief that it is a better environment to live in compared to others. Based on the above research works, we hypothesise that perceived attachment to existing virtual worlds can result in a greater desire to try another, improved version, which is what the metaverse is meant to offer. In other words, the perception of the current virtual places as better habitats than real places can make the prospect of migrating to the metaverse both exciting and safe. Realistic and identity threats of the metaverse People who do not feel comfortable in virtual places or do not have much experience with them can be more reluctant to use metaverse technology and feel more threatened by the rapid development of the metaverse. The media discourse around this technology currently points to its negative consequences, ranging from threats to privacy to the hard-to-predict effects of alienating people from real places. In this study, we set out to conceptualise the concerns surrounding the development of the metaverse, building on intergroup threat theory (ITT) (Stephan & Stephan, 2017). ITT distinguishes two general ways in which one group can perceive threat coming from another group: 1) realistic threat (related to the power, resources or well-being of the group) and 2) symbolic threat (related to the group’s values, culture or way of life) (Stephan & Stephan, 2017). Many studies have shown that both types of anxiety underlie intergroup biases, prejudice and conflicts (e.g. Guerra et al., 2022). Importantly, both realistic and symbolic threats may not necessarily be real: the perception of an outgroup as a threat to the ingroup resources or values is sufficient to trigger a hostile reaction towards it (Rios, Sosa, & Osborn, 2018). A vast majority of research on the two types of threat has focused on human intergroup relations; however, a growing body of research has been devoted to threats from nonhuman entities. For example, Zlotowski et al. (2017) demonstrated that attitudes towards robots are characterised not only by the realistic threat (e.g. loss of job or compromised safety due to potential uncontrollability of robots) but also the symbolic threat (e.g. fear of losing human uniqueness). Similarly, Han, Park and Li (2021) showed that the evaluation of services based on artificial intelligence (AI) is driven by the extent of perceived threat, according to which AI is considered to possess too many characteristics hitherto perceived as exclusively human. Interestingly, other phenomena, such as diseases, can also be viewed in terms of these two types of threats. Kachanoff et al. (2021) show that realistic and symbolic threats are attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and have different consequences: the former is associated with adherence to anti-covid recommendations, and the latter, with resistance to social isolation and affirmation of national identity. Thus, their study shows that the ITT can be successfully applied to understand fears raised by entities other than social groups or their artificial equivalents. We argue that the metaverse, aimed at being a disruptive technology that fundamentally modifies the way humans live and experience the world, can also evoke the perception of realistic and symbolic threats. In this research, we operationalise the metaverse-related realistic threat on the basis of the public discourse surrounding the development of this technology, for example, the fear of giving too much control to technology companies or weakening human ability to maintain valuable interpersonal relationships in the real world (e.g. Zhao et al., 2022; Fernandez & Hui, 2022; Huddleston, 2022; MacDonald, 2022; Bojic, 2022). Moreover, we conceptualise the metaverse-related symbolic threat as the feeling that the proposed virtualisation of everyday life disconnects humans from their inherent experience of the world and, consequently, from the basic experiences that are perceived as crucial for the development of human beings. In other words, we aim to explore the extent to which people fear that the metaverse can take humanity out of touch with the everyday experiences that have shaped the evolution of human species and have served as the foundation for the development of human identities for millennia. Similar concerns were also analysed by Nagy and Koles (2014), who proposed that after the digital revolution, human identity construction may not be considered only in relation to the real, physical world; instead, the answer to the question ‘Who am I really?’ may have to include the virtual self. We argue that a similar question asked in the context of humanity as a whole – ‘Who will I be after or in the metaverse?’ – may form the basis of the symbolic threat related to this technology (see also Kelly, 2021; Szaniawska-Schiavo, 2022). Additionally, as virtual worlds are still primarily associated with the domain of leisure and entertainment, we assume that the metaverse-related symbolic threat can also stem from concerns that the metaverse’s popularity can translate into an increased escapism tendency (Han et al., 2022), rendering individuals incapable of dealing with the hardships of their daily lives. Thus, the concept of leaving the real world in favour of a potentially joyful and consumerism-oriented digital one can be perceived as infantile, detaching the metaverse’s users from the true meaning of their existence (e.g. Francombe, 2022; Bogost, 2021). Therefore, we hypothesise that both realistic and symbolic threats are negatively related to willingness to migrate to the metaverse. Technology use and general attitudes towards technology We also intend to examine how the frequency of previous experiences with virtual places and general attitudes towards technology are related to the willingness to migrate to the metaverse and one’s attachment to virtual places and metaverse-related symbolic and realistic threats. Previous research shows that the frequency of technology use is positively associated with the acceptance of future technologies that may not yet be available to the general public (e.g. in the context of autonomous cars, Zmud & Sener, 2017, and smart city technologies, Wnuk & Oleksy, 2021). The more similar they are and the more similar needs they meet, the easier positive experiences from the existing types of technology can transfer to new technologies (Wnuk & Oleksy, 2021). We assume that this is the case with the metaverse, which can be conceived of as a more advanced version of virtual places. Additionally, the frequency of technology use can be a natural predictor of greater attachment to virtual places, analogous to the research on attachment to real places, where the length of one’s residence and contact with the place is a consistent predictor of increased attachment (Lewicka, 2011). In terms of symbolic and realistic threats, we expect that the use of technology (in this case, exploring virtual places) can allow users to become accustomed to it and encourage its perception as safe and useful, thereby reducing concerns related to the development of similar technology. In terms of general attitudes towards technology, conceptualised as the belief that technological progress is beneficial for the world and humanity, previous research shows that it is associated with openness towards different technologies of the future (e.g. sex robots, Oleksy & Wnuk, 2021). Consequently, we expect it to be associated with a lower perceived threat related to the metaverse and a greater willingness to move at least some of one’s activities into this new world. Overview of studies The main aim of the conducted studies was to examine whether place attachment to the existing virtual worlds (e.g. chats, social media sites and games) and the symbolic and realistic threats related to the metaverse development would differently predict one’s willingness to migrate to the metaverse worlds. We conducted two studies: Study 1, among users of open-world games (N = 366), and Study 2, among a sample of the Polish adult population (N = 995). We expected that place attachment would be positively related to the willingness to migrate to a metaverse world and would negatively predict the two types of threats (both realistic and symbolic threats were expected to be associated with the unwillingness to migrate to the metaverse). In addition, we tested whether and how the use of virtual places and general attitudes towards technology are related to all above variables. The studies was approved by Ethics Committee of [name of the institution]. Participants and procedure Study 1 Study 1 was conducted on a convenience sample of gamers (users of open-world games) recruited via announcements of dedicated Facebook groups (e.g. fans of Witcher 3, Assassin creed and open-world games in general). Open-world games are defined as a virtual world in which the player can approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay. This type of game was chosen because the features of these games (possibility to explore, interact with other characters and experience a variety of adventures without a predetermined scenario) are similar to the metaverse version we studied (an open virtual world to inhabit). A total of 528 individuals started participating in the survey; however, only those who had completed the entire survey (N = 366) were included in the analysis. Sample comprised 66 women, 297 men, three participants declared as nonbinary. The mean age of participants was 26.98, SD = 7.00. The most popular chosen games were The Witcher III (109), Elden Ring (35), The Elder Scrolls (27), Red Dead Redemption II (28), Grand Theft Auto V (15) and Assassin’s Creed (15). The respondents read the following definition of the metaverse (translated from Polish). The metaverse is a new vision for the internet, in which virtual reality is used to increase the possibilities for interaction between users. The metaverse is intended to offer opportunities as similar as possible to those provided by the real world. Through dedicated goggles, users can experience the digital world in a way close to reality. A metaverse user takes the form of an ‘avatar’, a digital body used to communicate with other users. The avatar can have any appearance; for example, it can be a human, robot or any creature. The metaverse is designed to offer various entertainment opportunities, from sports to games of all kinds. In the metaverse, it is possible to make friends with and date people from other parts of the world without having to leave home. Business entities can hold meetings with their customers, confer with employees from all over the world and offer their virtual services in the metaverse. Users can shop at malls and attend events and concerts of actual existing performers in the virtual world. After reading this definition, the respondents completed a questionnaire. Measures Relative place attachment towards virtual places. We asked the respondents whether they felt more attachment to certain virtual places than to real-world places. We constructed eight questions based on Williams and Vaskes’s scale of place dependence (2003) and Twigger-Ross and Uzzell’s scale of place identity (1996). Both measures underpin the role of places in making individuals feel good, worthy and self-sufficient. The scale we used included the following statements: (1) ‘Some virtual places are more important for me than my favourite places in the real world.’ (2) ‘There are virtual places that fulfil the needs that I couldn’t/shouldn’t fulfil in the real world.’, (3) ‘I often feel better in my favourite virtual place than in the real world.’, (4) ‘Virtual places mean more for me than real places.’, (5) ‘I can be who I am in virtual places to a greater extent than in real-world places.’, (6) ‘In virtual places, I can shape the reality around me to a greater extent than in real places.’, (7) ‘In some virtual places, I feel more at home than in the real world.’ (α = .86) Realistic threat was measured with four statements: (1) ‘The development of the metaverse will make it difficult for people to establish relationships in the real world’; (2) ‘Through the development of the metaverse, people will stop caring about places in the real world’; (3) ‘The development of the metaverse will allow authorities to distract people from the problems in the real world’; and (4) ‘The metaverse will allow technology companies to control every aspect of our behaviour’ (α = .79). Symbolic threat was measured with the following five statements: (1) ‘The development of the metaverse technology will induce people to stop understanding what real life means’; (2) ‘Excessive use of the metaverse will deprive us of experiences in the real world that are crucial to being human’; (3) ‘Being in the metaverse will disconnect us from real life’; (4)  ‘The metaverse will make people more infantile’; and (5) ‘The metaverse will induce people to live in a fantasy world instead of facing real life’ (α= .90). Willingness to migrate to metaverse was measured with two items: (1)‘I would like to move most of my daily activities to the metaverse.’, (2) (2) ‘If possible, I would prefer to work in the metaverse rather than in the real world’. (r = .55). For all the above measures, answers were measured on a scale from 1 (‘I strongly disagree’) to 7 (‘I strongly agree’). For all the above measures, answers were measured on a scale from 1 (‘I strongly disagree’) to 7 (‘I strongly agree’). Analytical Strategy Many previous studies have distinguished between realistic and symbolic type of threat, however, these measures are often highly correlated and several studies treated threat as a single construct (e.g. Smeekes et al., 2017). Therefore, first, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine whether symbolic and realistic threats form one or two factors. Second, we confirmed empirical distinctiveness of our constructs also via CFA. Then, we checked zero-order correlations. Next, we specified structural equation models. Structural equation modeling (SEM) enables estimation of model fit and uses latent variables to account for measurement error. The analyses were performed using Mplus 7.0 software (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). Results Confirmatory Factor Analyses The CFA showed that the two types of threat were not empirically distinguishable in our sample. Although the two correlated-factors model yielded very good fit (χ2 = 60.75, df = 26, p = .0001, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .06), the high intercorrelation of the two latent factors (Φ = 1.00, p <.001) indicated that their separation posed problems of multicollinearity and is not justified. The one factor solution had also a perfect fit to the data (χ2 =59.78, df = 27, p = .003, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .06). Thus, we adopted a one-factor solution for metaverse-related threats. Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis showed that the place attachment, metaverse-related threat and willingness to migrate to metaverse are empirically distinct constructs. A model with three latent factors fitted the data well: χ 2 (132) = 257.53, p < .001; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.05. All factor loadings were above 0.40. To verify that these constructs were empirically distinct, additional factor analyses were run, in which all items were forced to load as one factor. This resulted in a worse model fit: (χ2 (135) =  1188.621, p < .001, CFI = 0.61, RMSEA = 0.15, SRMR = 0.17). Zero-order correlations The correlations between main variables are presented in Table 1. We observed the opposite effects of place attachment and threat on migration to metaverse, i.e. the first correlated positively and the second negatively. Additionally, place attachment was negatively correlated with threat. Table 1 Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals Variable M SD   1 2 1.

Threat did not predict willingness to migrate. Place attachment lowered the threat related to Metaverse. The exact coefficients are shown on Figure 1. The main results did not change significantly when covariates (age, sex) were added. Figure 1. Effects of place attachment and threat on willingness to migrate to the metaverse. Note: Standardized coefficients with a standard error (in brackets) are presented. Dashed lines represent non significant coefficients. Discussion As predicted, greater attachment to virtual (vs real) places was associated with greater willingness to migrate to the metaverse and negatively associated with the metaverse threat. However, contrary to our hypothesis, threat formed a single factor - yet this result is also quite common in typical studies in an intergroup context (Smeekes et al., 2017). Additionally, in the full model, threat was not related to lower willingness to migrate to the metaverse. It is also worth noting that the willingness to migrate to the metaverse was low; at the same time, the threat level was high. In a second study, we aimed to see if these results hold in the representative sample of Polish citizens. We also decided to examine the role of technology use and attitudes towards technology in shaping attachment to existing virtual worlds and attitudes towards the metaverse. Participants and Procedure Study 2 Study 2 was part of a broader research conducted using a nationwide sample (N = 995) via The sample size was sufficient to detect a small to medium effect size assuming power of 90% and probability level at α = .05. To ensure compatibility with the structure of the Polish population, a random quota sample was invited in alignment with the demographic structure of the 18–70-year-old Polish population with respect to gender, age and size of residence place. All participants were rewarded for their participation in the study with rewardable points. We did not exclude any participants. Respondents read the same definition of metaverse as in Study 1. Measures Relative place attachment towards virtual places (α = .93), symbolic threat (α = .93) and realistic threat (α = .88) were measured with the same items as in Study 1. Willingness to migrate to the metaverse was extended to three items: (1)‘I would like to move most of my daily activities to the metaverse.’, (2) ‘If possible, I would prefer to work in the metaverse rather than in the real world’, (3) ‘I would rather spend time with friends in the real world than in the metaverse’ (reversed). α = .70 Attitudes towards technology were measured with two items: (1)‘Technology makes our lives healthier, easier and more comfortable’ and (2) ‘Thanks to technology, future generations will have more opportunities’. (r = .59). For all the above measures, answers were measured on a scale from 1 (‘I strongly disagree’) to 7 (‘I strongly agree’). Use of virtual places was measured with the question: Please tell us how often you use the following technological tools: 1) social networking sites, 2) discussion groups, 3) single-player games, 4) multiplayer games, 5) online chats. Answers were measured on a scale from 1 (‘never’) to 7 (‘very often’). α= .77. Analytical Strategy Again, we confirmed empirical distinctiveness of our constructs via Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Then, we checked zero-order correlation and conducted SEM analysis. The analyses were performed using Mplus 7.0 software (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). Results Confirmatory Factor Analyses Similarly to Study 1, we observed a very strong correlation between both our measures of threat. Therefore, we performed confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to examine whether symbolic and realistic threats form one of two factors. The CFA showed that the two types of threat were not empirically distinguishable in our sample. Although the two correlated-factors model yielded very good fit (χ2(26) = 41.94, p = .002, CFI = .993, RMSEA = .03), the high intercorrelation of the two latent factors (Φ = 1.00, p <.001) indicated that their separation posed problems of multicollinearity and is not justified. The one factor solution had also a perfect fit to the data (χ2 = 42.79, df = 27, p = .03, CFI = .993, RMSEA = .02). Thus, we again adopted a one-factor solution for metaverse-related threats. Additionally, confirmatory factor analysis showed that the place attachment, metaverse-related threat and willingness to migrate to metaverse are empirically distinct constructs. A model with three latent factors fitted the data better: χ2 (149) = 523.49, p < .001; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.06 than model in which all items were forced to load as one factor: (χ2 (152) =  3814.28, p < .001, CFI = 0.55, RMSEA = 0.21, SRMR = 0.16). Zero-order correlations The correlations between main variables are presented in Table 2. We observed the opposite effects of place attachment and threat on willingness to migrate to the metaverse i.e. the first correlated positively and the second negatively. Additionally, pace attachment was negatively correlated with threat. Table 1 Means, standard deviations, and correlations with confidence intervals Variable M SD 1 2 3 4 1. Place attachment 2.91 2.

The results showed that willingness to migrate to metaverse was predicted positively by place attachment  and negatively by threat. Place attachment was again related to lower level of metaverse-related threat. Moreover, the use of technology significantly predicted place attachment and willingness to migrate to the metaverse, attitude towards technology did not. However, attitude towards technology predicts the level of metaverse threat. The exact coefficients are shown on Figure 1. The main results did not change significantly when covariates (age, sex) were added. Figure 2. Effects of place attachment and threat on willingness to migrate to the metaverse. Note: Standardized coefficients with a standard error (in brackets) are presented. Dashed lines represent non significant coefficients.  Discussion Study 2 partially confirmed (on the representative sample) the results obtained earlier on a sample of users of open world games. Again, place attachment was associated with a greater willingness to migrate to the metaverse and with reduced threat. Contrary to Study 1, threat remained a significant predictor of willingness to migrate to the metaverse while accounting for place attachment. In addition, in the full model, the use of virtual places was associated with greater place attachment and higher willingness to migrate, and overall attitude towards technology was associated with lower feelings of metaverse-related threat. General Discussion The metaverse development is likely to become the next milestone on the road to the further virtualisation of our daily lives (e.g. Damar, 2021; Riva et al., 2022). However, as with any technological transformation, this development can raise fears and concerns. In our research, we primarily focused on exploring the extent to which bonds with existing virtual places, such as VR games, chat rooms and social networks, could be associated with a desire for virtual migration to metaverse worlds. We also expected that the current attachment to virtual places could translate into lower perceived threat and, thus, a more positive attitude towards the potential transfer of everyday activities to the metaverse. Place attachment and migration In both studies, we showed that attachment to the existing virtual, as opposed to real, places is positively related to a greater willingness to migrate to the metaverse, which is in line with the literature, showing that individuals desire to be in places they are attached to (Low & Altman, 1992) and are likely to choose similar places to stay in the future. For example, Feldman (1990) found that attachments to particular types of residential settlements (urban, suburban, rural, etc.) affect the types of neighbourhoods individuals select when moving to other locations. Thus, moving to the metaverse can allow users to stay close to the previous objects of attachment, such as the existing virtual worlds, and to benefit from their improved version (see also Di Masso et al., 2019). This result fits in with a new conceptualisation of place attachment, showing that it is a dynamically changing phenomenon influenced by human experiences of places (Di Masso et al., 2019). For example, discovering a new place or its new features can induce individuals to develop a strong enough attachment not to want to leave it. On the contrary, other locations may no longer seem exciting or safe when compared to a new place (Gustafson, 2009; Lewicka, 2011). The changing strength of attachment can, therefore, facilitate a potential decision to migrate elsewhere (e.g. Zwiers et al., 2018). In the case of this study, attachment to virtual places can exceed attachment to real-world locations, so much so that the latter can be perceived as less likely to provide reasons to spend more time therein, now or in the future when metaverse technology becomes available. Additionally, a stronger attachment to virtual places can be linked to a desire to explore new types of places in the metaverse. Attached to virtual places more than to real-world ones, individuals can regard the metaverse as another, more advanced version of their favourite virtual locations, and having developed a deep relationship with the existing virtual worlds, they may be more inclined to explore and experience their new variations, expecting their previous positive experiences to be reinforced. This interpretation is in line with previous research, showing that place attachment can predict further desire to explore a place, learn about its various aspects and use it for new activities (Lewicka, 2011). Similar to how place attachment to a city can intensify individuals’ desire to check, for example, whether there is a new restaurant or historical heritage in another neighbourhood, attachment to virtual worlds can prompt users to explore what life in the metaverse can be like. However, the preference of a virtual place to a real one can also be related to one’s willingness to escape problems associated with real life, or so-called escapism (Calleja, 2010). Escapist tendencies are observed among many users of virtual places (Giardina et al., 2021; Billieux et al., 2013) and can be linked to the perception of being rooted in the digital world and a stronger reluctance to interact with real places, generally perceived as less enjoyable to stay in. Thus, the metaverse can be regarded by such individuals as technology that allows them to detach themselves even more effectively from the real world, in the same way that staying in a perfectly equipped house in the countryside allows one to become detached from the daily hustle and bustle more efficiently than nesting in a crowded dormitory in the city centre. To sum up, on the one hand, attachment based on positive experiences of using the existing virtual places can translate into a greater willingness to use new but familiar technological solutions, i.e. the metaverse. On the other hand, some individuals can perceive metaverse development as a chance to find refuge from the outside world. Further research should unravel which of the two motives is more prominent in explaining the relationship between attachment to virtual places and the desire to migrate to the metaverse. Further studies should also include a direct, separate measurement of attachment to real and virtual locations. Additionally, by using longitudinal designs, it can be beneficial to see how changing attachment to both types of places can explain the attitude towards moving to the metaverse. Threat and willingness to migration and place attachment The conducted analyses did not show that symbolic and real metaverse-related threats form two separate factors. Such results are quite common in the intergroup relations context as these two types of threat are often highly correlated (e.g. Smeekes et al., 2017) and, thus, cannot be treated as separate predictors of the investigated phenomenon. However, in this study, an additional reason for the one-factor solution can be the novelty of the metaverse technology. As the metaverse was brought to the general public’s consciousness only in 2021, the participants may not yet have had particularly nuanced views on it; instead, they could display strong attitudes, either in favour of this technology or not. This observation can reflect a rather polarised discourse towards the metaverse, where critical voices often include a range of potential risks without focusing on differentiating between them, for example, in terms of probability. It is possible that when metaverse technology becomes more widespread, the threats associated with it will be perceived more heterogeneously. For example, users can find that the threat to privacy (realistic threat) is relatively less than they feared, while the disconnection from real-world places (symbolic threat) is higher. Further studies can be conducted in the future when the number of metaverse users and public awareness of this technology increase. Perceived threat was high in both studies, which suggests that the participants consider the metaverse to be a technology that can have detrimental consequences for society. These findings enrich the scarce research on the relationship between perceived threat and attitudes in a context other than intergroup relations (e.g. Złotowski et al., 2017; Kachanoff et al., 2021). Previous research on threat and technology acceptance showed that feeling threatened by autonomous robots was related to a lack of support for further development (Zlotowski et al., 2017). The findings of this study demonstrate that metaverse-related threat is strongly associated with the reluctance to use the technology in the way its most optimistic proposers envisage, i.e. as a complete alternative to real life. Moreover, both studies showed that a metaverse-related threat was negatively associated with the willingness to migrate to the metaverse. A greater perception that the development of this technology can pose danger to individuals and humanity meant a lower desire to move social or professional activities to virtual worlds. However, in the sample of gamers in Study 1, we found that attachment was a stronger predictor than a threat, which became insignificant while these two variables were included in the model. Thus, it seems that for people having positive experiences with virtual worlds with some metaverse characteristics (i.e. open-world games), attachment is more important than a sense of threat related to the metaverse in explaining the desire to migrate to the metaverse. Further research should resolve whether the perceived similarity between open-world games and the metaverse is indeed the mechanism behind this effect. In line with our hypotheses, we observed a negative relationship between place attachment and metaverse-related threats. The correlational design disallows causal interpretation, but this result is in line with previous research on the role of place attachment in human life. Place attachment mostly entails the belief that a place is a safe location where one can feel comfortable and explore freely (Lewicka, 2011, 2005). A negative experience with a place, such as a perceived danger or disorder, can, in turn, inhibit the development of attachment to that place (Hummon, 1992; Jaśkiewicz & Wiwatowska, 2018). Users who are attached to virtual sites may not regard their potentially improved variant (the metaverse) as threatening simply owing to the perceived familiarity of the place (see e.g. Jeske & van Schaik, 2017). Additionally, the less attached users may have had more negative experiences with the existing virtual places than the more attached ones (e.g. they may have experienced more privacy risks). These adverse experiences can translate into a higher assessment of perceived threats from similar but more advanced technologies. Therefore, further research should consider a greater diversity of groups that the metaverse may threaten as the development of this technology can have more negative consequences for some groups, such as the poor and minority groups, who are less able to enjoy the opportunities offered by real places or perceive these places as alien or alienating (see e.g. Rishbeth, 2003; Wickes et al., 2022 ). Considering the perspectives of these individuals can give a more complete picture of the symbolic and realistic threats related to the metaverse. Technology use and general attitudes towards technology As expected, the frequency of the existing virtual places’ use was associated with greater attachment to virtual, as opposed to real, places, which is in line with many studies, emphasising that the length of residence is a critical predictor of place attachment (Toruńczyk-Ruiz & Martinović, 2020; Lewicka, 2011). No significant association between the use of virtual places and perceived metaverse-related threat was observed. Thus, it was place attachment, rather than simply frequency of use, that was associated with a greater sense of security in the face of new emerging technology. These findings align with previous research on attachment to real places, which shows that not every resident feels safe, but residents who feel attached to a place do feel safe (see e.g. Hummon, 1992). In the full model, a positive relationship between general attitudes towards technology and metaverse-related threat was observed: even those participants who considered technology development to be conductive for humanity felt much anxiety about this new type of virtual place. As even those who have a very positive attitude towards technology may not consider every possible technology desirable or safe, the metaverse may not be considered among the technologies that are believed to be capable of positively impacting human life. This result reflects both a wide range of controversies prominent in the media discourse related to the metaverse (e.g. Huddleston, 2022; MacDonald, 2022; Kelly, 2021; Szaniawska-Schiavo, 2022) and the respondents’ overall attitudes towards this technology (perceived threat was significantly above average in both of the conducted studies). Therefore, a promising direction for further research could be to examine to what extent the content of information acquired about the metaverse can explain the relationship between users’ attitudes towards technology and metaverse-related threat. It would also be worthwhile to conduct a rigorous analysis of the media discourse and to determine, for instance, to what extent the metaverse is presented as a way for corporations to increase their profits at the expense of users and to what extent as a useful or entertaining technology. Responding to public concerns remains a crucial task for all parties interested in implementing the metaverse in a socially responsible way. Limitations In addition to the outlined potential avenues of research that can further enhance the obtained results, there are limitations of the conducted studies. First, in both studies, we introduced the participants to only one metaverse concept (a virtual world into which one can transfer most of one’s daily activities and lead everyday life), which is arguably the most popular vision of the metaverse; however, it is crucial to consider that there are other dimensions of the metaverse, such as the metaverse as deep integration of the virtual world into the real world. It can be argued that other propositions may be associated with weaker perceived threat than the metaverse offering a radical break from typical human life. Another limitation of the study is related to the sample as it was conducted in only one country. Further studies need to be carried out in other cultural backgrounds, for example, in countries with an even higher virtualisation of daily life and a more extensive user base of early metaverse implementations. Future studies should also use established questionnaires on place attachment and compare attachments to real and virtual places using separate scales. In further studies, the topics raised in the realistic and symbolic threat scales should be expanded, for example, by adding issues related to mental health risks (e.g. addictions) or potentially unhealthy lifestyles. It is also essential to conduct experimental studies, such as involving manipulated place attachment (see e.g. Scannel & Gifford, 2017), to understand the causal relationships between place attachment, perceived threat and willingness to migrate to the metaverse. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study is the first to show the role of place attachment in shaping attitudes towards the metaverse. Additionally, it is the first study to analyse attitudes towards the metaverse from the perspective of realistic and symbolic threats, a theory that has been applied mostly in intergroup relations. The conducted study has shown that greater attachment to virtual, as opposed to real, places is associated with a greater willingness to migrate to a new type of virtual worlds. However, the majority of the respondents expressed a sense of threat associated with the further development of the metaverse and ranging from individual security issues, such as breached privacy, to the belief that this technology could deprive users of access to inherently human experiences. The results can provide a basis for further research to understand the factors that make the metaverse a convenient space for recreation for some and a dystopian nightmare about to come true for others.
