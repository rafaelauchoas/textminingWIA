Introduction: Pointwise ranking functionsThe Spohnian paradigm of ranking functions [16,17] is in many respects like an order-of-magnitude reverse ofsubjective probability theory [9]. “Ranks represent degrees”—or rather: grades—“of disbelief” ([19]: 6). Whereas ahigh probability indicates a high degree of belief, a high rank indicates a high grade of disbelief.There are many parallels between probability theory and ranking theory [16,18], and in Footnote 22 of his [16]Spohn “wonder[s] how far the mathematical analogy [of his ranking functions to probabilities] could be extend-ed”.1 The starting point of this paper is one of the few places where ranking theory differs from subjective probabilitytheory as well as qualitative-logical approaches to the representation of epistemic states such as entrenchment order-ings in belief revision theory: the domain on which these models are defined, that is, what they take to be the objectsof belief.Unlike probabilities, ranking functions are only indirectly—via a pointwise ranking function on a non-empty set ofpossibilities (possible worlds, models) W —defined on some finitary/σ -/complete field A over W , i.e., a set of subsetsof W containing the empty set and closed under complementation and finite/countable/arbitrary intersections. Let ushave a closer look.E-mail address: franz@caltech.edu (F. Huber).1 Ranking theory is very similar to possibility theory [5], and it would be highly desirable to know to what extent the results below also hold forpossibility measures. Unfortunately this goes beyond the scope of this research note.0004-3702/$ – see front matter  2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.artint.2005.10.016F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–471463A function κ from W into the set of natural numbers N is a pointwise ranking function on W iff κ(ω) = 0 for atleast on ω ∈ W . A pointwise ranking function κ : W → N is extended to a function (cid:4)κ on a field A over W with rangeN ∪ {∞} by defining, for each A ∈ A,(cid:1)(cid:4)κ (A) =min{κ(ω): ω ∈ A},∞,if A (cid:5)= ∅,if A = ∅.As will be seen below, it is useful to allow that some possibility ω ∈ W is sent to ∞, which amounts to ω being a“virtually impossible possibility” (according to κ). In order to distinguish the more restricted notion of a pointwiseranking function as defined above from the more liberal one allowing for virtually impossible possibilities, let us callthe former natural pointwise ranking functions (because the range of κ is restricted to the set of natural numbers N ).Pointwise ranking functions κ are functions defined on a non-empty set of possibilities W that take natural numbersor ∞ as values. They are extended to functions (cid:4)κ on a field A over W by stipulating that the rank of any non-emptyproposition A ∈ A equals the minimum rank of the possibilities in A, i.e., (cid:4)κ (A) = min{κ(ω): ω ∈ A}, and the emptyproposition is sent to ∞.In case W is a finite set of possibilities and A its powerset, every possibility corresponds to a proposition (viz.the singleton containing it). But already when W is the set of all models ModL for a propositional language Lwith infinitely many propositional variables and A is the field {Mod(α) ⊆ W : α ∈ L}, no possibility corresponds toa proposition. Furthermore, one has to specify a ranking over uncountably many possibilities in order to assign apositive finite rank to a single proposition. But clearly, we often have a definite opinion about a single proposition(represented in terms of a sentence) even if we do not have an idea of what the underlying set of possibilities lookslike—let alone what our ranking over these possibilities might be. For instance, I strongly disbelieve that one can buya bottle of Schilcher for less than 1 Euro, though I lack the relevant enological vocabulary in order to know whatall the possibilities are. Indeed, it seems the underlying set of possibilities should not matter for my disbelief in thisproposition.More generally, we should be able to theorize about our epistemic states even if all we are given is a rankingover the sentences or propositions of some language or field, and we have no ranking over the underlying set ofpossibilities. After all, what we as ordinary or scientific believers do have are plenty of beliefs and grades of beliefin various propositions—usually if not always via beliefs and grades of belief in sentences or other representations ofthese propositions. When we want to attach ranks to sentences, pointwise ranking theory first has us specify a set ofpossible worlds for the language the sentences are taken from; then we have to specify a ranking over these possibleworlds, which in turn induces a ranking over sets of possible worlds; and only then can we identify the rank of asentence with the rank of the proposition containing exactly the possible worlds making our sentence true.This is a bit awkward. What one would like to do is to start with a ranking of the sentences in L, and then be ableto induce a pointwise ranking function on the corresponding set of possible worlds that yields the original ranking.The question is whether this is always possible. In order to answer it, let us first define ranking functions on fields ofpropositions and rankings on languages. (For a similar generalization of pointwise ranking functions see [21].)2. Ranking functions and rankings on languages(Finitely minimitive) ranking functions are functions (cid:4) from a field A over a set of possibilities W into the set ofnatural numbers extended by ∞2 such that for all A, B ∈ A:(1) (cid:4)(∅) = ∞;(2) (cid:4)(W ) = 0;(3) (cid:4)(A ∪ B) = min{(cid:4)(A), (cid:4)(B)}.If A is a σ -field/complete field, (cid:4) is a σ -minimitive/completely minimitive ranking function iff, in addition to (1)–(3),we have for every countable/possibly uncountable B ⊆ A:2 One can also take the set of ordinal numbers smaller than or equal to some limit ordinal β and send ∅ to β, but we do not need this generalityhere.464(cid:2)(4) (cid:4)(B) = min{(cid:4)(B): B ∈ B}.F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–471In case A is finite, i.e., if A contains only finitely many elements, these distinctions collapse. According to (4), therange of ranking functions has to be well-ordered. Therefore N is a natural choice. A ranking function (cid:4) on A isa pre-ranking iff (cid:4) is a finitely minimitive ranking function on A such that(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:4)(A): A ∈ B= minB(cid:4)for every countable B ⊆ A such thatB ∈ A. A ranking function (cid:4) is regular iff (cid:4)(A) < (cid:4)(∅) for every non-emptyA ∈ A. The conditional ranking function (cid:4)(· | ·) : A × A → N ∪ {∞} based on the ranking function (cid:4) : A → N ∪ {∞}is defined such that for all A, B ∈ A with B (cid:5)= ∅,(cid:2)(cid:1)(5) (cid:4)(B | A) =(cid:4)(B ∩ A) − (cid:4)(A),0,if (cid:4)(A) < ∞,if (cid:4)(A) = ∞.The second clause says that, conditional on a (virtually) impossible proposition, no non-tautological proposition isbelieved in (cid:4). Goldszmidt and Pearl ([9]: 63) define (cid:4)(B | A) = ∞ for A = ∅, which means that, conditional on theimpossible proposition, every proposition is maximally believed in (cid:4). We further stipulate that (cid:4)(∅ | A) = ∞ for everyA ∈ A, which completes the definition of a conditional ranking function and ensures that (cid:4)(· | A) : A → N ∪ {∞} is aranking function.If the function (cid:4)κ : A → N ∪ {∞} is induced by a (natural) pointwise ranking function κ : W → N , (cid:4)κ is a (regularand) completely minimitive ranking function. The converse is not true. The triple A = (cid:9)W, A, (cid:4)(cid:10) with W a set ofpossibilities, A a finitary/σ -/complete field over W , and (cid:4) : A → N ∪ {∞} a ranking function is called a finitary/σ -/complete ranking space. A is called regular iff (cid:4) is regular, and A is called natural iff (cid:4) is induced by some naturalpointwise ranking function κ.A proposition A ∈ A is believed in (cid:4) iff (cid:4)(A) > 0. (cid:4)’s belief set Bel(cid:4) = {A ∈ A: (cid:4)(A) > 0} is consistent anddeductively closed in the finite/countable/complete sense whenever (cid:4) is finitely/σ -/completely minimitive. Here Bel isB (cid:5)= ∅ for every finite/countable/possibly uncountable B ⊆ Bel;consistent in the finite/countable/complete sense iffand Bel is deductively closed in the finite/countable/complete sense iff for all A ∈ A: A ∈ Bel wheneverB ⊆ A forsome finite/countable/possibly uncountable B ⊆ Bel.3(cid:8)(cid:8)Observation 1. For any ranking space A = (cid:9)W, A, (cid:4)(cid:10) and all A, B ∈ A:1. min{(cid:4)(A), (cid:4)(A)} = 0.2. A ⊆ B ⇒ (cid:4)(B) (cid:1) (cid:4)(A).Rankings κ : L → N ∪ {∞} on languages L are defined such that for all α, β ∈ L:0. α (cid:12)(cid:13) β ⇒ (cid:4)(α) = (cid:4)(β).1. α (cid:13) ⊥ ⇒ (cid:4)(α) = ∞.2. (cid:13) α ⇒ (cid:4)(α) = 0.3. (cid:4)(α ∨ β) = min{(cid:4)(α), (cid:4)(β)}.4. β (cid:5)(cid:13) ⊥ ⇒ (cid:4)(β | α) = (cid:4)(α ∧ β) − (cid:4)(α) (= 0 if (cid:4)(α) = ∞).5. β (cid:13) ⊥ ⇒ (cid:4)(β | α) = ∞.To be sure: (cid:13) ⊆℘ (L) × L is the classical consequence relation (and singletons on the left hand side are identifiedwith the wff they contain). The corresponding definitions and observations for finitely minimitive ranking functionsalso apply for rankings on languages. Finally, the minimitivity labels correspond to the additivity labels of probabili-ties, where it is to be noted that complete additivity does not make sense for probabilities.3 If possibility theory is interpreted in terms of uncertainty rather than imprecision, one can define a notion of belief—positive degree of necessity,or equivalently, degree of possibility smaller than 1—that is consistent and deductively closed in the finite, though not in the countable sense.F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–4714653. Extending rankings on languagesIn probability theory we can start with a probability Pr on a language L, i.e., a function assigning non-negativereal numbers to all sentences in L such that logically equivalent sentences are assigned the same number, tautologiesare assigned probability 1, and a disjunction of two logically incompatible sentences is assigned the sum of theprobabilities of its two disjuncts. This probability Pr on L induces a finitely additive probability measure, in fact, apre-probability Pr∗0(Mod(α)) = Pr(α). By Carathéodory’s theorem,Pr∗0 is then uniquely extended to a σ -additive probability measure Pr∗ on the smallest σ -field σ (A) containing A.More precisely, Carathéodory’s theorem says that whenever we have a pre-probability, i.e., a finitely additive0 on the field A = {Mod(α): α ∈ L} by defining Pr∗probability measure Pr∗(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:5)∗Pr0B=Pr∗0(A)0 on a finitary field A such thatA∈B(cid:2)whenever A contains the unionexistence and uniqueness of a σ -additive Pr∗ on σ (A) that coincides with Pr∗B of a countable set B of disjoint elements A ∈ A, then we are guaranteed theThis is different in ranking theory. If we start with a ranking (cid:4) on a language L, i.e., a function that assigns thesame rank to logically equivalent sentences, that sends contradictions to ∞ and tautologies to 0, and that assignsto a disjunction as its rank the minimum of the ranks of the two disjuncts, then we also get a finitely minimitiveranking function, in fact, a pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0(Mod(α)) = (cid:4)(α). However, there may be uncountablymany pairs of σ -minimitive (and also completely minimitive) ranking functions (cid:4)∗2 on σ (A) that extend (cid:4)∗1, (cid:4)∗0,i.e., (cid:4)∗1(A) = (cid:4)∗0(A) = (cid:4)∗2(A) for every A ∈ A, but that are not even ordinally equivalent in the sense that there are1(B) (cid:1) (cid:4)∗B, C ∈ σ (A) such that (cid:4)∗2(C). This is shown by the following example.0 on A by setting (cid:4)∗1(C) and (cid:4)∗2(B) > (cid:4)∗0 on A.Example 1 (No unique extension). The first example shows that a regular pre-ranking cannot always be uniquelyextended to a σ -minimitive ranking function. This means in particular that there need not be a unique pointwiseranking function inducing a given pre-ranking.Consider the smallest set of wffs closed under the propositional connectives ¬ and ∧ (with ∨, →, and ↔ definedin the usual way) and containing the set of propositional variables P V = {pi: i ∈ N}. (cid:4) on L is defined by assigningeach consistent sentence rank 0, and contradictions are sent to ∞. As mentioned, (cid:4) induces a finitely minimitiveranking function (cid:4)∗0 is a regular pre-ranking.Note that for every α ∈ L, Mod(α) ∈ A is either empty or uncountable.0 on A = {Mod(α): α ∈ L} by defining (cid:4)∗0(Mod(α)) = (cid:4)(α). Indeed, (cid:4)∗The smallest σ -field σ (A) containing A has as elements, among others, the singletons containing ω, for everyω ∈ ModL, because(cid:10)(cid:6){ω} =Mod(α) ∈ A: ω |= α, α ∈ L(cid:7)∈ σ (A)(there are but countably many wffs α ∈ L, so this is an intersection of countably many elements of A). Now considerany of the uncountably many countable subset S of ModL, and let κ be any pointwise ranking function on ModLsuch that κ(ω) > 0 for ω ∈ S, and κ(ω) = 0 for ω ∈ ModL \ S. (cid:4)κ (Mod(α)) = 0 = (cid:4)∗0(Mod(α)) for every non-emptyMod(α) ∈ A, and (cid:4)κ (∅) = ∞ = (cid:4)∗0(∅).Still, one might argue, the interesting question is not uniqueness, but whether there exists a pointwise rankingfunction that induces the pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0 one started with. In case of existence, one can further ask whether there isa unique minimal pointwise ranking function κ ∗ that induces the pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0, i.e., a pointwise ranking function0 and such that no pointwise ranking function κ with κ(ω) < κ ∗(ω), for some ω ∈ W , also induces κ ∗κ ∗ inducing (cid:4)∗0 .As shown by the following example, one cannot expect there to be a natural pointwise ranking function inducing the0, even if (cid:4)∗pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0 is regular.Example 2 (No regular σ -minimitive and no natural pointwise extension). The second example shows that a regularpre-ranking cannot always be extended to a regular and σ -minimitive ranking function. This means in particular thata regular pre-ranking need not be induced by a natural pointwise ranking function.For P V , L, and A as in Example 1, let (cid:4) be defined as follows:466F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–471(cid:4)(pi) = i + 1,(cid:4)(¬pi) = 0,(cid:1)(cid:4)(±pi1∧ · · · ∧ ±pin) =(cid:6)(cid:4)(αi): 1 (cid:1) i (cid:1) n(cid:4)(α1 ∨ · · · ∨ αn) = minmax{(cid:4)(pij ): ±pij∞,(cid:7),= pij , 1 (cid:1) j (cid:1) n},if ± pi1if ± pi1∧ · · · ∧ ±pin∧ · · · ∧ ±pin(cid:5)(cid:13) ⊥,(cid:13) ⊥,where max ∅ = 0. By putting every wff α ∈ L into disjunctive normal form we get a regular ranking on L, and hence0 on A. However, in order to extend (cid:4)∗a regular pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0 to a σ -minimitive ranking function on σ (A)—andhence also in order for (cid:4)∗0 to be induced by a pointwise ranking function on ModL—all but countably many of the(singletons {ω} containing the) possibilities ω ∈ ModL must be sent to ∞.This is seen as follows: Every ω ∈ ModL can be represented by an infinite sequence ω = (cid:9)±p1, . . . , ±pn, . . .(cid:10),where +pn means ω(pn) = 1, and −pn means ω(pn) = 0. If there are infinitely many i ∈ N such that ω(pi) = 1,then ω must get rank ∞. (Suppose the rank of ω is n < ∞. Then there is m (cid:2) n such that ω(pm) = 1. (cid:4)∗0(Mod(pm)) =m+1 > n, although ω |= pm—a contradiction.) So ω has a finite rank only if ω(pi) = 0 for all but finitely many i ∈ N .For each n ∈ N there are but countably many ωs such that ω(pi) = 1 for exactly n natural numbers i ∈ N . So thereare only countably many ωs with ω(pi) = 1 for all but finitely many i ∈ N , and hence only countably many ωs witha finite rank.Still, one might continue to argue, the naturalness of pointwise ranking functions—in contrast to the regularity ofrankings—is too restrictive anyway, and the above example is not sufficient to rule out the existence of an “unnatural”pointwise ranking function that induces (cid:4)∗0. After all, the important thing is that we do not send any consistent sentencefrom L or any non-empty proposition from A to ∞, even though we may have to consider some possibilities asvirtually impossible. This is a familiar phenomenon from probability theory, where the Lebesgue measure on the σ -field of Borel sets over the reals assigns any singleton containing a real number—indeed, any countable set of realnumbers—measure 0, though no non-trivial interval gets Lebesgue measure 0.So, when we start with a ranking (cid:4) on L, and thus get a pre-ranking (cid:4)∗0 on A, is it the case that we always get a0 on A, and hence (cid:4) on L, even though one isunique minimal pointwise ranking function κ ∗ on ModL that induces (cid:4)∗sometimes forced to send some possibilities ω ∈ ModL to ∞? The answer is given byTheorem 1 (Extension theorem for rankings on languages). Let L be a language, i.e., a countable set of wffs closedunder negation and conjunction, and let (cid:4) be a ranking on L so that (cid:4)∗0 is a pre-ranking on the field A = {Mod(α): α ∈L}, where (cid:4)∗Then there is a unique minimal pointwise ranking function κ ∗ on ModL that induces (cid:4)∗0(A) =min{κ ∗(ω): ω ∈ A} for every non-empty A ∈ A; and for every pointwise ranking function κ on ModL such thatκ(ω) < κ ∗(ω) for at least one ω ∈ ModL, (cid:4)∗0(A) (cid:5)= min{κ(ω): ω ∈ A} for some A ∈ A.0. That is, (cid:4)∗0(Mod(α)) = (cid:4)(α).Proof. Let A1 = Mod(α1), . . . , An = Mod(αn), . . . be an enumeration of all the countably many elements of A, anddefine κ ∗n as follows:∗n (ω) = (cid:4)κ(cid:11)(±A1 ∩ · · · ∩ ±An)ω(cid:12),∗0where (±A1 ∩ · · · ∩ ±An)ω is the unique element of the finite partitionPn = {±A1 ∩ · · · ∩ ±An} ⊆ Aof W = ModL such that ω ∈ (±A1 ∩ · · · ∩ ±An)ω. For each ω ∈ W , κ ∗quence of natural numbers, i.e., κ ∗exists, and as ∞ otherwise, i.e., κ ∗(ω) = limn→∞ κ ∗1 (ω), . . . , κ ∗n (ω), . . . is a non-decreasing se-n (ω) for m (cid:1) n. κ ∗(ω) is defined as the limit of this sequence, if this limitWe first show that κ ∗ is a pointwise ranking function on W , i.e., that at least one ω ∈ W is assigned κ ∗-rank 0.m(ω) (cid:1) κ ∗n (ω).Either (cid:4)∗0(A1) = 0 or (cid:4)∗∗0(B1) = 0 = min0(A1) = 0. Let B1 = A1, if (cid:4)∗0(A1) = 0, and B1 = A1 otherwise. Hence(cid:7)(cid:6)∗0(B1 ∩ A2)(cid:4)∗0(B1 ∩ A2), (cid:4).(cid:4)F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–4714670(B1 ∩ A2) = 0, and B2 = A2 otherwise. In general, let Bn = An, if (cid:4)∗Let B2 = A2, if (cid:4)∗(cid:4)∗0(B1 ∩ · · · ∩ Bn−1 ∩ An), and Bn = An otherwise. So for each n,∗∗for all ω ∈ B1 ∩ · · · ∩ Bn.0(B1 ∩ · · · ∩ Bn) = 0 = κn (ω)(cid:8)∞(0) ⊇ B1 ∩ · · · ∩ Bn, for each n, we have κ ∗−1(0) =(cid:4)As κ ∗−1(cid:8)∞ninconsistent. By the compactness of classical logic, there is a finite subset Bfin = {βi1, . . . , βini.e.,(cid:8)∞n=1 Bn. It remains to be shown thatn=1 Bn = ∅. This means that the set of wffs B = {βi ∈ L: Mod(βi) = Bi} is} ⊆ B that is inconsistent,n=1 Bn (cid:5)= ∅. Suppose for reductio that0(B1 ∩ · · · ∩ Bn−1) = 0 =n=1 κ ∗−1(0) ⊇(cid:8)∞nMod(βij ) ∈ A: 1 (cid:1) j (cid:1) n(cid:7)= ∅.n(cid:10)(cid:6)j =1Let m = max{ij : 1 (cid:1) j (cid:1) n}.

Suppose there is a pointwise ranking function κ on W such that κ(ω) <n (ω), where κ ∗(ω) = ∞ if this limit does not exist. If this limitm(ω) < ∞. If this limit does not exist, then for each n therem is a natural pointwise ranking function, for each m ∈ N ). So0(A(cid:21)) for that element A(cid:21) := ±A1 ∩ · · · ∩ ±An ofκ ∗(ω) for some ω ∈ W . This means κ(ω) < limn→∞ κ ∗exists, there is n such that for all m (cid:2) n, κ(ω) < κ ∗is m > n such that κ ∗n (ω) < κ ∗in both cases there is n such that κ(ω) < κ ∗Pn such that ω ∈ A(cid:21), we have κ(ω) < (cid:4)∗0(A(cid:21)) for some ω ∈ A(cid:21) ∈ A. Hence κ does not induce (cid:4)∗m(ω) < ∞ (remember: κ ∗n (ω) < ∞. As κ ∗n (ω) = (cid:4)∗n (ω) = κ ∗0. (cid:1)Theorem 1 is encouraging, but does not extend to pre-rankings on arbitrary fields.Example 3 (No pointwise extension on arbitrary fields). The third example shows that a regular and σ -minimitiveranking function on a σ -field cannot always be induced by a pointwise ranking function. This means in particular thata regular pre-ranking on a field need not be induced by a pointwise ranking function.Let the σ -field over (cid:22) beR = {A ⊆ (cid:22): A is countable or A is countable},and let (cid:4)(A) = ∞, if A is empty, (cid:4)(A) = 1 if A is non-empty and countable, and (cid:4)(A) = 0 if A is uncountable.(cid:4) is a regular and σ -minimitive ranking function: (cid:4)(∅) = ∞, (cid:4)((cid:22)) = 0, and for every countable B ⊆ R, (cid:4)(B) =B is non-empty andmin{(cid:4)(A): A ∈ B}. This is seen as follows: Ifcountable, then every A ∈ B is countable, and at least one A ∈ B is non-empty. Finally, ifB is uncountable, then atleast one A ∈ B must be uncountable, too.B is empty, then so is every A ∈ B; and if(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)Clearly (cid:4) cannot be induced by a pointwise ranking function κ. (cid:4)({r}) = 1, and so κ(r) = 1 for every r ∈ (cid:22). Butthen min{κ(r): r ∈ (cid:22)} = 1 > (cid:4)((cid:22)).Note, though, that Example 3 leaves open the question whether a pre-ranking on a field A can be extended to aσ -minimitive ranking function on σ (A).Given that logically equivalent sentences are assigned the same rank, it might seem it should not matter whetherone works with rankings on languages or ranking functions on fields. However, the above shows that this is not quitecorrect. The propositions on a set of models ModL induced by the sentences of a language L are not just any subsets ofan arbitrary set of possibilities W —as they often are when one considers measure-theoretic fields in general. Rather,they come with their own structure—most notably, closure under finite intersections only and compactness—that isinherited from the structure of L. Ranking functions behave nicely on this structure, but they do not do so in general.Assuming that we believe in representations of propositions, say sentences, and not propositions themselves—thatis, assuming that belief is a sentential or representational, and not a propositional attitude—and assuming that thestructure of its objects is of importance for the representation of belief, this might be taken to be another reason formodeling epistemic states by ranking functions.There are several other areas where one needs finitely minimitive ranking functions. They are a sine qua nonwhen one wants to have the reals as range (or some other set of numbers that is not well-ordered by the smaller-thanrelation <). The reason is that in this case the minimum of a sequence of real-valued ranks need not exist.As is well known, the lottery-paradox [11] does not arise for ranking functions (cid:4)κ induced by pointwise rankingfunctions κ. Considering a lottery with n tickets where exactly one ticket wins, we have as set of possibilities theset Wn = {ωi: i (cid:1) n, i ∈ N}, where ωi is the possibility that ticket i will win (the field is the powerset of W ). Bydefinition, a pointwise ranking function assigns rank 0 to at least one possibility ωi ∈ Wn. Hence one cannot modelthe situation that somebody believes of every ticket that it will not win, i.e., (cid:4)κ ({ωi}) > 0 for every ωi ∈ Wn. If, on theother hand, one allows sending all possibilities to a rank greater than 0, then one cannot model the situation that onebelieves that some ticket will win, i.e., (cid:4)κ (∅) > 0 and (cid:4)κ (Wn) = 0.In the finite case this is true for arbitrary ranking functions. However, if we turn to an infinite lottery with countablymany tickets, the set of possibilities is W∞ = {ωi: i ∈ N} (we take as field the powerset of W∞). Now we can sendevery singleton {ωi} to a rank greater than 0 and still get a finitely minimitive ranking function that assigns rank 0 toW∞. For instance, we can assign rank 0 to A whenever A is not finite—say because we go by the slogan: plausibilityis cardinality of the set of possibilities; and whenever A is finite, we assign it the minimum of the ranks (cid:4)({ωi}), for allpossibilities ωi in A (whatever these singleton ranks are). Then we have a finitely minimitive ranking function that iscompatible with any ranking of the singletons {ωi}. In particular, if we believe, for every ticket in this infinite lottery,F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–471469that it will not win, i.e., (cid:4)({ωi}) > 0 for every ωi ∈ W , we can nevertheless be maximally convinced that some ticketwill win: (cid:4)(∅) = ∞ and (cid:4)(W∞) = 0. This is not possible for a ranking function (cid:4)κ induced by a pointwise rankingfunction κ. We can have the above ranking with 0 for every infinite A only if we send at most finitely many ωi s to arank greater than 0. Similarly for pre-rankings.4. Probabilities, entrenchments, rankingsSpecifying a pointwise ranking function over uncountably many possible worlds is not feasible. In view of thisfact it might be surprising that there are applications in artificial intelligence (e.g. [2,9]) that apparently do work withpointwise ranking functions. However, these applications actually work with ranking functions on fields, which aretrivially induced by pointwise ranking functions as long as the set of possibilities is finite—and the languages and setsof possible worlds considered in the above mentioned literature are finite so that each possible world corresponds to asentence.Ranking theory is a middle course between probabilistic and logical approaches to the representation of partialbelief and belief revision—in the sense that ranking functions are measured on a proportional scale, whereas proba-bilities are measured on an absolute scale, and entrenchments on an ordinal scale.4 In the literature on AGM beliefrevision theory [1,6] the objects of belief are sentences—or, because of extensionality, the propositions expressed bythese sentences (though not any sets of possibilities). These logical accounts enable one to express that A is moreentrenched or believed than B, and that B is more believed than C. But in this framework an epistemic agent is notallowed to quantify the strength of her beliefs. Indeed, she cannot even say that the difference between the strengthsof her beliefs in A and B is greater than the difference between the strengths of her beliefs in B and C. Probabilisticaccounts more or less share the objects of belief (though the focus is more on the semantic side, and any set of pos-sibilities can be a proposition), but require the epistemic agent to have precise numerical degrees of belief. Rankingtheory is a moderate middle course: The epistemic agent can say whether A is more believed than B and that B isin turn more believed than C. In addition, the epistemic agent can express that the difference between her grades ofbelief in A and B is greater than the difference between her grades of belief in B and C without having to specifywith complete accuracy a numerical degree of belief for each of A, B, C. More precisely, the agent can express hergrades of belief as multiples of some minimally positive grade of belief.5Given this ranking theory should be welcomed by both subjective probabilists and epistemic logicians. As a matterof fact, however, neither is the case. Logicians object that it is a mystery where the numbers (ranks) come from (see,however, [19]), and probabilists complain about the ordinal nature of the ranking apparatus. Yet there is one featurethat is shared by both probabilistic and logical accounts of partial belief and belief revision, but that is not present inpointwise ranking theory: In both approaches the objects of belief are sentences or propositions, whereas in Spohnianpointwise ranking theory the objects of belief are the possible worlds one level below. So by formulating rankingtheory in terms of ranking functions on a field and rankings on languages we simultaneously approach probabilistic aswell as logical accounts; and we also get rid of the ideal of specifying a ranking over all possible worlds, a requirementno real-world epistemic agent could ever meet.6Continuing this comparison we note that probabilists have the notions of positive and negative relevance andof independence between propositions, which seem to be of utmost importance.7 Furthermore, they have a way ofrevising one’s epistemic state represented by a probability measure over a field A, viz. Jeffrey conditionalisation,4 I am grateful to an anonymous referee for pressing me further on this point.5 The epistemic logician will note that the ordering α < β ⇔ (cid:4)(¬α) < (cid:4)(¬β) satisfies all conditions for entrenchment orderings mentioned inSection 4.2 of [7], with K = {α ∈ L: (cid:4)(¬α) > 0}.6 In his [19] Spohn presents the theory of measurement for his ranking theory, but does so only for the finite case. It should be clear that a theoryof measurement for σ -minimitive, let alone completely minimitive or pointwise ranking functions also covering the infinite case is inapplicable.One necessary condition for an ordering of disbelief to be represented by a σ -minimitive (or completely minimitive or pointwise) ranking functioni∈N Bi ofis that whenever A is not more disbelieved than any of infinitely many propositions Bi , then A is not less disbelieved than the unionall these propositions Bi . For finitely minimitive ranking functions and rankings on languages this condition reduces to the following finite version:Whenever A is not less disbelieved than either one of B and C, then A is not less disbelieved than B ∪ C.7 Conditional probabilistic independence and its (incomplete) axiomatization, the (semi-)graphoid axioms, started to become of interest with[3,14,15]. Judea Pearl and his group at UCLA started to work with independence in the eighties (e.g. [8,12,13]); for a survey see [18] or [4]. A lotof work on axiomatizing independence has been done by Milan Studený (e.g. [20]).(cid:2)470F. Huber / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 462–471when the incoming evidence is represented by a probability measure over a subfield of A. Logicians neither have thenotions of positive and negative relevance and independence nor do they have an appropriate way of updating theirepistemic state represented by a selection function or an entrenchment ordering. Pointwise ranking theory has bothof these desirable features [16], and the question is whether they are preserved when we generalize these to rankingfunctions on fields. The answer is that they are. Copying from Spohn [19], A is positively relevant for/independentof/negatively relevant for B given C in the sense of the ranking function (cid:4) iff(cid:4)(A ∩ B | C) + (cid:4)(A ∩ B | C)<=>(cid:4)(A ∩ B | C) + (cid:4)(A ∩ B | C).If (cid:4) : A → N ∪ {∞} is the agent’s ranking function on the field A over W at time t, and between t and t (cid:21) the agent’sranking function on the field E ⊆ A changes to (cid:4)(cid:21) : E → N ∪ {∞}, and the agent’s ranking function does not change onany field B such that E ⊂ B ⊆ A, then the agent’s ranking function on A at time t (cid:21) should be (cid:4)(cid:4)→(cid:4)(cid:21) : A → N ∪ {∞},(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:4)→(cid:4)(cid:21)(·) = minκ(· | Ei) + (cid:4)(cid:21)(Ei): i ∈ I(cid:7),where {Ei ∈ E: i ∈ I } is a partition of W for which there is no finer partition {Ej ∈ E: j ∈ J }, and I, J are any indexsets.On the other hand, epistemic logicians have the notion of a belief set that is consistent and deductively closed [10].As shown by the lottery paradox, there is no ε > 0 such that the set of all propositions A with Pr(A) (cid:2) 1 − ε isdeductively closed and consistent. So probabilists lack the notion of a belief set (as long as belief is sufficiently highdegree of belief). Any pointwise ranking function κ gives rise to a belief set Bel = {A ∈ A: (cid:4)κ (A) > 0} which isBel (cid:5)= ∅, and forconsistent and deductively closed in the following complete sense (even if Bel is uncountable):every A ∈ A: A ∈ Bel wheneverBel ⊆ A.(cid:8)(cid:8)We have already noted in Section 2 that the same holds true for ranking functions on fields, and conclude byworking out this observation for rankings on languages. The belief set Bel = {α ∈ L: (cid:4)(¬α) > 0} induced by aranking (cid:4) on L is consistent and deductively closed in the classical finite sense. If Bel (cid:13) β, for some β ∈ L, then, bythe compactness of classical logic, there is a finite Belfin ⊆ Bel such that Belfin (cid:13) β. Let Belfin = {α1, . . . , αn}. Then¬β (cid:13) ¬α1 ∨ · · · ∨ ¬αn. (cid:4)(¬β) (cid:2) (cid:4)(¬α1 ∨ · · · ∨ ¬αn) by Observation 1 for rankings on languages, and (cid:4)(¬α1 ∨ · · · ∨¬αn) = min{(cid:4)(¬αi): 1 (cid:1) i (cid:1) n, i ∈ N} by clause 3 in the definition of rankings on languages. Hence (cid:4)(¬β) > 0, i.e.,β ∈ Bel. As to consistency, suppose for reductio that Bel is inconsistent. Then Bel (cid:13) ⊥, which means (cid:4)((cid:25)) > 0—incontradiction to clause 2 in the definition of rankings on languages.5. ConclusionIn this paper we have generalized pointwise ranking functions on sets of possibilities to ranking functions on fieldsof propositions and rankings on languages. In doing so we have kept the important notions of positive and negativerelevance as well as independence. Through the belief set induced by a ranking function, we also save the link betweenbelief and degrees of belief—the very feature distinguishing ranking theory from other theories of degrees of belief.8Finally, Theorem 1 and Examples 1–3 from Section 3 clarify the conditions under which ranking functions andrankings on languages are induced by pointwise ranking functions.AcknowledgementsI am grateful to Wolfgang Spohn for comments on an earlier version of this paper, as well as to three anonymousreferees for their constructive criticism.My research was in part supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Federal Ministry of Educationand Research, and the Program for the Investment in the Future (ZIP) of the German Government through a SofjaKovalevskaja Award to Luc Bovens, while I was a member of the Philosophy, Probability, and Modeling group at theCenter for Junior Research Fellows at the University of Konstanz.8 Cf., however, Footnote 3 in Section 2.F.
