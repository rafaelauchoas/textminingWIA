Javdan1, Tara L. Deans1,*1Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UTAbstractAdvances in synthetic biology have provided genetic tools to reprogram cells to obtain desired cellular functions that include tools to enable the customization of cells to sense an extracellular signal and respond with a desired output. These include a variety of engineered receptors capable of transmembrane signaling that transmit information from outside of the cell to inside when specific ligands bind to them. Recent advances in synthetic receptor engineering have enabled the reprogramming of cell and tissue behavior, controlling cell fate decisions, and providing new vehicles for therapeutic delivery.KeywordsSynthetic biology; receptor engineering; synthetic receptors; cell and tissue engineeringIntroductionA traditional focus of synthetic biologists is to apply engineering principles to reprogram cells with desired functions by assembling individual genetic parts into more complex gene circuits to produce switches [1–6], oscillators [7–10], and biosensors [11–16]. A newer approach is to engineer custom receptors to change which extracellular cues cells recognize to produce a desired cellular response. The concept that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” has become ubiquitous across a variety of disciplines, especially in systems biology where small-scale molecular interactions are engineered in ways that impact large-scale cellular and tissue functions. The advent of synthetic biology has enabled the engineering of cells and tissues to perform novel biological behaviors, often with the use of genetic circuits and designer synthetic receptors [17–22].

The clinical potential of cell therapy became clear with the recent FDA-approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma [32,33], a landmark achievement that represented a new paradigm in the treatment of human diseases. In short, patients’ T cells are engineered to produce a genetically modified receptor that endows them with the ability to target specific cancer proteins [20,34,35]. These efforts have highlighted how the engineering of receptors can lead to new cell signaling pathways beyond those found in nature. In this review, we discuss recent advances among several major classes of engineered receptors (Figure 1) as well as compare the methods used in their design and development. We also highlight the cell and tissue types modified by these engineered receptors, some potential challenges to future progress, as well as potential avenues for further synthetic receptor development.Receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands (RASSLs)G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a group of membrane receptors in eukaryotes that bind to a diverse number of extracellular molecules that cause a conformational change in the receptor, triggering second messenger molecules that initiate and coordinate intracellular signaling pathways. These receptors act as signaling switches for a vast array of physiological responses in the body, making them popular receptors for engineering synthetic signaling systems [36–38]. Many studies have sought to engineer GPCRs to be activated by pharmacologically inert small molecule drugs, a family collectively known as receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands (RASSLs) (Figure 1a). These engineered receptors have taken many forms, primarily designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) [39–41].DREADDs were initially developed by directed molecular evolution of human muscarinic receptors, which are involved in the parasympathetic nervous system, as a tool to study receptor-specific functions [39], and have since expanded to modulate the downstream GPCR pathways for several tissue engineering applications. The methods for designing novel RASSLs have spanned approaches in directed molecular evolution, directed mutagenesis, and structure-guided chimera development (Figure 2a–c). The earliest DREADDs were generated in yeast (Figure 2a) [39,42], however, more modern approaches have since been developed in mammalian cells, such as the Viral Evolution of Genetically Actuating Sequences (VEGAS) platform, which paves the way for evolving mammalian GPCRs that otherwise could not be successfully expressed in yeast [43]. Another common design approach has involved the substitution of conserved residues in the GPCR binding pockets with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis, allowing for fine tuning of the receptor’s binding affinity and potency (Figure 2b) [44,45]. Alternatively, chimeric GPCRs have been developed by structure-guided protein design principles, for example, the intracellular loops of one GPCR have been replaced with another while keeping the extracellular and transmembrane domains intact (Figure 2c) [46]. This approach allowed for the generation of Curr Opin Syst Biol.

Additionally, they have been engineered as ultrasound-responsive neuromodulations for the noninvasive control of memory formation in the mouse hippocampus [48], and in hepatocytes to stimulate cyclic AMP signaling and control glucose levels to study hyperglycemia [49]. Finally, DREADD-based therapeutics have been proposed for a variety of diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and drug addiction [40,50,51]. Data from these studies suggested that pharmacogenetics may enhance overall cellular signaling in reprogrammed cells, and could be used in cell replacement therapy for patients whose own cells have signaling deficiencies. Overall, DREADDs are an exciting avenue for synthetic biologists to rewire endogenous cellular signaling pathways in response to synthetic ligands to obtain desired cell behavior. For example, these receptors have been engineered to direct the migration of cells in response to the inert drug-like molecule, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) [52]. This work opens the possibility to engineer therapeutic cells with the capabilities of directing therapeutic cells to a user-specified location in the body.Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are a class of synthetic receptors that combine antigen­specificity and T cell (CAR-T) activating properties in a single fusion molecule [53,54]. CAR-T cells were the first FDA-approved genetically-modified cell-based therapy to induce complete remission of hematological malignancies in some patients where traditional chemotherapy has failed [32,33]. CARs are fusion proteins with an extracellular antigen recognition domain typically comprised of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) from a monoclonal antibody, a spacer/hinge region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain (Figure 1b) [53,55,56]. In contrast with many other synthetic receptors, CARs are often engineered by rational design principles, and are created as chimeric proteins (Figure 2c). Computational modeling and docking simulation data have also aided in the design and development of novel CARs, improving their overall specificity (Figure 2d) [57–59].Since their inception, there have been multiple generations of CARs, with the first generation lacking any costimulatory domains resulting in the cells not proliferating or surviving upon repeated antigen exposure. However, once costimulatory properties were incorporated into subsequent generations of CARs, they were shown to have a greater strength of antigen-induced signaling that also enabled T cell proliferation and survival upon repeated exposure to antigen [53,56]. Additional engineering of CARs have also been reported that can control on-off switches to enhance T cell function [60,61], contain therapeutic payloads [62], and implement Boolean operations to improve on-target off-tumor toxicity [63–66]. Most recently, the field has seen the development of universal CARs to allow for a variety of antigens to be targeted without requiring the immune cells to be re-engineered [61,66,67].Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 4With the success of CARs to enable custom programs to be engineered to redirect T cell cytotoxicity for targeting cancer cell antigens, efforts have also been made to apply this technology to natural killer cells (CAR-NK). Like T cells, NK cells are part of the immune system that naturally target and kill abnormal cells and destroy them. However, NK cells have the added advantage over CAR-T cells since they do not possess antigen specific receptors and only recognize molecular patterns generally associated with pathogens. This enables little to no graft vs. host disease effects [68]. In addition to treating lymphomas, the promise of CAR technology is observed in clinical trials for myeloma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and many more [68].Synthetic notch (SynNotch) receptorsNotch receptors are a class of transmembrane proteins that relay information from the cell surface to regulate transcription [69]. The Notch signaling pathway has been shown to control differentiation by regulating the spatial patterning, timing, and outcomes of many different cell fate decisions [70]. This signaling pathway involves the Notch receptor located on the receiver cell binding to its ligand located on the sender cell (Figure 1c). This binding induces the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcriptional activation.Synthetic Notch (SynNotch) receptors were developed to take advantage of this mechanism by utilizing the transmembrane domain of native Notch receptors alongside a modular extracellular nanobody and a synthetic transcription factor intracellular domain [22,71]. Their development uses a chimeric receptor design approach (Figure 2c), leaving the transmembrane domain of native Notch receptor intact while swapping out the intra- and extra-cellular domains. However, some efforts have been made to reduce ligand-independent (background) activation of SynNotch receptors by site-specific alterations, including adding an intracellular hydrophobic sequence to the C-terminus of the Notch core [72].In early versions of the SynNotch platform [71], the extracellular domain contained antibody fragments and peptide tags, while the intracellular domain contained various transcriptional activators and repressors (Figure 1c), such as Gal4-VP64 and tetR-VP64. This general design was used to drive antigen-induced cytokine programs in human T cells, skew T cell differentiation towards anti-tumor Th1 fate, as well as express a variety of immunotherapeutics in CD4+ T cells [73]. SynNotch receptors have also been combined with engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in human T cells to create AND-gate activation, requiring dual antigen recognition [34]. This idea was later expanded upon to generate a more complete set of cell-cell recognition behaviors using SynNotch modules to daisy-chain multiple receptor systems [74]. Most recently the SynNotch receptor was reverse engineered to generate a class of receptors with tunable sensing and responding capabilities, known as SYNthetic Intramembrane Proteolysis Receptors (SNIPRs) [75].SynNotch receptors have been further developed for sensing, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine applications. An optimized Notch-based synthetic receptor (synNQ) was used to sense and visualize cell-cell interactions in Drosophila in a variety of cell types and tissues, including myoblasts, tracheal cells, epithelial cells, and neurons [76]. The Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 5first tissue engineering applications of SynNotch receptors came with the introduction of synthetic morphogenesis circuits, allowing for self-organizing multi-layered spheroids, as well as two-layer structures based on circuit-induced fate bifurcation [77]. In an effort to deliver therapeutic payloads to cancers in a more controlled, antigen-dependent manner, SynNotch receptors have been demonstrated to enhance the specificity of existing CAR T-cell therapies [63,74,78–80]. Apelin-based synthetic Notch receptors have also been used on their own in engineered T cells to detect angiogenesis and treat solid tumors [81]. In light of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the synthetic Notch receptor platform was utilized to create SARSNotch, a live cell sensor, that was used to drive primary T lymphocyte responses to SARS-COV-2 spike proteins for their destruction [82].Modular extracellular sensor architecture (MESA)Modular Extracellular Sensor Architecture (MESA) is a major class of synthetic receptor systems designed to utilize orthogonality and thus act independently of endogenous signaling pathways [13]. MESA receptors consist of two transmembrane chains that dimerize upon ligand binding, resulting in triggering the intracellular proteolytic cleavage of a transcription factor (Figure 1d). These receptors were originally designed with modular domains to allow for performance tuning based on varying cleavage kinetics, receptor geometry, and steric interactions [13,15]. Design strategies to further optimize these receptors were made possible by mechanistic computational modeling (Figure 2d), taking into account factors such as background signaling, ligand binding, as well as cell variation to explain heterogenous promoter activity [83]. Most recently, MESA receptors have been improved to provide low background signaling as well as high signaling fold induction upon ligand binding [84]. This was achieved by identifying several key design handles such as ectodomain choice, transmembrane domain choice, protease engineering, signaling mechanism, and expression level. These observations led to the design of a novel MESA variant that utilized a tuned split Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease mechanism [84], guided by recent computational advances in split protease optimization [85]. These receptors have been used in the development of rapamycin-inducible signaling systems [13], and adapted to enable human T cells to sense vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and secrete interleukin 2 (IL-2) as an output signal [15]. MESA designs have since been multiplexed; individual MESA receptors with their own unique inputs combined synergistically to produce outputs which converge on a single promoter, inducing transcription [83].Tango receptorsWhile many synthetic receptors have been designed for creating novel cell signaling functions, some groups have sought to engineer receptors exclusively for monitoring purposes to better understand protein interactions within a cell. The initial design of the Tango receptors, which utilizes a fusion protein of a GCPR with a transcription factor separated by a protease cleavage site, has not been significantly altered since its original inception (Figure 2c). In this method, a second fusion protein comprised of TEV protease and β-arrestin2 is recruited to the cleavage site only upon activation of the receptor, allowing for release of the transcription factor (Figure 1e). Tango receptors have been Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 6used to study transient and rapidly changing signaling events since they provide a stable and amplified output response from the cell in the form of an irreversible transcription factor (TF) release mechanism. The TF then translocates to the nucleus to influence gene expression of a reporter (Figure 1e). This system was used to monitor the activity of GPCRs, receptor tyrosine kinases, and steroid hormone receptors [86]. The Tango receptors were later adapted to map sites of neuromodulation in the Drosophila brain to identify a dopamine-mediated control of behavior in primary sensory neurons [87]. This was expanded upon with the advent of iTango, a light- and ligand-inducible version of the Tango assay that was used to map and study the roles of two classes of dopaminergic neurons during the locomotion in response to cocaine within a mouse model [88].Engineered Tango receptors have been utilized to interrogate the druggable human GPCR landscape in a method called parallel receptorome expression and screening via transcriptional output (PRESTO-Tango) [89]. This platform built upon the original Tango approaches by allowing for the rapid and simultaneous profiling of over a hundred nonorphan human GPCR targets [89].Challenges and progressEngineering novel synthetic receptors such as RASSLs, CARs, Tango, SynNotch, and MESA has led to a number of new ways to sense and control cellular behavior. These creative endeavors have, in turn, led to the development of engineered cells and tissues to be used for therapeutic purposes, including neural cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myoblasts, and more, all designed to perform novel functions (Figure 3).Synthetic receptors have been designed and developed using a variety of methods, each with their own benefits and challenges (Table 1). These methods include directed evolution, site­specific mutagenesis, chimeric and fusion proteins, as well as computational approaches. For example, RASSLs were developed primarily by directed evolution approaches involving iterative cycles of random mutagenesis, followed by selection [39,42,43]. This has led to the creation of synthetic receptors activated by small molecule drugs and with relatively low basal activity [40,50]. However, some RASSL agonists, such as clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), have been known to produce significant off-target side effects in rodent and non-human primate models [90–92], leading to recent efforts to develop new agonists with higher specificity and lower dosage requirements [93]. This highlights the need for engineered receptors activated by safe, clinically-approved agonists, an unmet need that should continue to be explored.Structure-guided protein design principles have also been heavily utilized in the design of engineered receptors. By understanding the functions of specific secondary and tertiary structures, chimeric or fusion proteins have been developed to accept the input signal of one receptor but provide the output signal of another. Some of these synthetic receptor design decisions were made as a direct result of computational modeling [59,58,57,85], including the use of machine learning algorithms and structure prediction software. Computational approaches for ligand-based receptor engineering have significantly improved the success of predicting how to design signaling functions into receptors [94].Curr Opin Syst Biol.

Indeed, there are areas of synthetic receptor engineering where we may have only scratched the surface, and for which there may be great potential in advancing cell and tissue engineering. RASSLs have been primarily restricted to the field of neuroscience, while CARs remain largely focused on immunotherapy. However, the underlying protein design principles that underscore these synthetic receptors are not field-specific. Chemogenetic tools used in neural cells today could potentially be applied to hematopoietic or myogenic cells tomorrow. Systems biology has also seen some of its greatest advances in the face of cross-disciplinary research collaboration, and perhaps it is at these intersections that novel synthetic receptors for cell and tissue engineering are waiting to be discovered.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the generous support from the following programs: National Science Foundation CAREER Program [CBET-1554017], the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program [N00014-16-1-3012], the National Institutes of Health Trailblazer Award [1R21EB025413-01, and the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award [1DP2CA250006-01].References:*of special interest** of outstanding interest1.

Major classes of engineered receptors used in cell and tissue engineering.(a) Receptor Activated Solely by Synthetic Ligand (RASSL), where the ligand binding domain has been engineered to respond to a pharmacologically inert small molecule drug (blue ball) such as clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or deschloroclozapine. Binding of the small molecule agonist causes a conformational change in the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). These G proteins activate downstream signaling pathways in the cell. (b) Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) comprised of an extracellular antigen-binding domain, transmembrane domain, and intracellular costimulatory domains. (c) Synthetic Notch (SynNotch) receptors utilize the central regulatory domain of the Notch protein while altering both the extracellular sensor module and intracellular transcriptional module. Engagement with the Delta family of proteins (ball on stick) present on the surface of sender cells leads to binding of the receiver cell via its recognition domain leading to intramembrane proteolysis of the SynNotch receptor and the release of a transcription factor to enter into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. (d) Modular Extracellular Sensor Architecture (MESA) senses extracellular ligands without reliance on native receptors or signaling pathways. Binding of a ligand (ball) induces receptor dimerization of a target chain and protease chain. This causes Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 14the protease on the protease chain to cleave a target sequence on the target chain, releasing a transcription factor that will modulate gene expression. (e) Tango assay architecture, wherein a membrane protein is fused to a transcription factor with a TEV protease binding site linker. Simultaneously expressed with this fusion protein is TEV protease fused to β-arrestin2. Ligand activation of the GPCR leads to C-terminal phosphorylation, which in turn recruits the arrestin-TEV protease for proteolytic cleavage. This frees the transcription factor, allowing it to enter the nucleus and modulate gene expression.Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 15Figure 2. Primary methods used in the design and development of engineered receptors.(a) In directed evolution approaches, a mutant library of receptors is generated by error­prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR), then translated in cells to generate a mutant cell library. Mutant candidates that survive selection are isolated and used for the next round of evolution. An example selection method would be using a yeast strain that couples receptor activation directly to cell growth and division [42]. This method has been most heavily utilized in the generation of RASSLs. (b) In site-specific mutagenesis, receptors are modified at specific amino acid residues based on prior knowledge in the field. This can be from known hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions, informed by known functions of gene sequences with the desired characteristics from a different organism, or from computational modeling of the receptor active site. This method has been used in the development of RASSLs, SynNotch, and Tango receptors. (c) Chimeric or fusion proteins often involve altering the intracellular and/or extracellular domain of a native receptor such that it either responds to a new input, provides a new output, or both. Transcription factors are often fused to the intracellular domains via linkers containing proteolytic cleavage sites, while antibody fragments are often fused to the extracellular domain of the engineered receptor for antigen recognition. This engineering approach has been utilized in nearly every major class of synthetic receptor. (d) Computational approaches to engineered receptor design have involved the modeling of protease cleavage kinetics, receptor geometry, and steric interactions, as well as the use of machine learning algorithms and structure Curr Opin Syst Biol.

Computationally-informed design has been used most commonly in the development of novel CARs and MESAs.Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 17Figure 3. Potential future directions for engineered receptors in human cells and tissues.(a) Current engineered receptor designs are largely restricted to a specific set of cell and tissue types. For example, RASSLs are most often used in neural cells, CARs in T cells, and SynNotch receptors in both T cells and a variety of epithelial cells. (b) Existing engineered receptors could be employed in new cell and tissue types. For example, RASSLs could be used to activate G protein-coupled receptor pathways in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, such as blood cells. Neural cells could be engineered to sense extracellular ligands recognized by existing MESAs but not existing RASSLs, then provide a specified transcriptional output. (c) Various engineered receptors can be combined to provide novel functions, a concept that has already been used to combine CARs with SynNotch receptors [34]. For example, a T cell could be engineered with a SynNotch receptor that binds a highly expressed cell surface marker on cancer cells, triggering proteolytic cleavage of a transcription factor (TF). This TF could then localize to the nucleus and activate transcription of the arrestin-TEV protease involved in the Tango assay. Then, only in the simultaneous presence of an extracellular ligand as well as expression of the arrestin-TEV protease, a second TF could be released. This would effectively create and AND-gate requiring both the proximal recognition of a cancer cell marker as well as the presence of an extracellular ligand. (d) Novel fusion receptors could be developed to perform unique functions. For example, one could imagine a chimeric RASSL-GPCR, where the Curr Opin Syst Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 01.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptJavdan and DeansPage 18extracellular domain of the RASSL allows it to be activated by its pharmacologically inert agonist while the intracellular domain of the GPCR allows activation of a GPCR pathway not typically coupled to the RASSL. This could be used to potentially control stem cell differentiation, or even allow one neurotransmitter to activate a neuronal pathway that it does not natively activate. Another possible chimeric receptor could involve the fusion of a MESA extracellular recognition domain to the intracellular signaling or costimulatory domains of CARs in T cells. Thus, rather than recognizing a tumor cell surface antigen, the receptor could instead recognize an extracellular ligand that in turn leads to T cell activation.Curr Opin Syst Biol.
