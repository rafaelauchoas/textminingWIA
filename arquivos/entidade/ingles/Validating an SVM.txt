These years have given methe possibility to learn and grow both as a researcher and as a person. Iam immensely proud of myself, having finally finished, as I was so manytimes considering to give up. I could never have made it without the peoplearound me. I want to thank all of you who always believed in me, especiallywhen I didn’t believe in myself.The biggest thanks goes to you Nathan. I’m forever grateful for havingyou as my advisor. No one could have done a better job, both in lifting myspirits in difficult times and in sharing your endless knowledge on thisspecific field. Thank you for bearing with me all these years. I miss ourmorning coffees with discussions on signal processing.This project wouldn’t have been possible without my advisors and super-visor. Thank you Sampsa for offering this chance, for the financial supportfrom various research grants and for your patience. Thank you Lauri foralways being there to support me and to offer your guidance. I am veryhappy to have chosen you as my supervisor, in this and previous researchprojects of mine. Your feedback and advice were irreplaceable. Thank youmy co-authors Päivi and Leena for your knowledge and valuable input onthe publications, not forgetting your encouraging support and kind words.I also want to thank the Finnish cultural foundation for believing in thisproject and giving me the opportunity to work with a personal grant. Iwas very lucky to have economical support for my research throughout theproject and I hope many more of my peers would have the same chance.I want to thank my dearest colleague Minna for being a true friend andcompanion. You gave me such mental support, that no one else could havegiven. I cherish the memories of us learning together, celebrating oursuccess together, sometimes struggling together and the entire spectrum offeelings that we went through the past years. Thank you for always beingthere. I don’t know what I would do without you.My friend and mentor Arthur, thank you for always encouraging me tokeep going, and for offering opportunities to concentrate on my research.Thank you for showing me all the great possibilities of personal growth1Prefaceduring this (sometimes heavy) process. Many times I wanted to give upbut you kept me going.My loving fiance Peter. You kept me standing especially towards the end,took care of me when I was struggling and took me out of the house whenI couldn’t take it anymore. You really did everything you could to help meget through the difficult times. You were always telling me how proud youwere and celebrated my success, even more than I did myself. For that andfor thousands of other things I love you.I also want to thank my parents for being so proud and supportivethroughout my life. You have given me the support to become a confidentand determined person, which I believe have been important qualities tosuccess in many fields of life. Without my social skills and empathy thatI learnt from you, I wouldn’t have been able to collect the right peoplearound me to support me in achieving my goals.During these five years I have learned much about automated neonatalseizure detection, conducting research, life, and people, but mostly aboutmyself. This process has offered me many situations to reflect and takeresponsibility of my choices and feelings. It has taken me around the worldto meet so many different kinds of people. These encounters have trulyenriched my life. Only a fraction of my dear friends and colleagues havebeen mentioned here by name but I hope you all know your importance tome. Your support to help me through this project has been irreplaceable.I’m forever grateful to have all of you in my life.Kuopio, November 29, 2022,Karoliina T Tapani2ContentsPrefaceContentsList of PublicationsAuthor’s ContributionAbbreviationsSymbols1.Introduction2.

Theneed for intensive medical attention is due to several factors, such aslack of oxygen (birth asphyxia) during delivery. Perinatal asphyxia cancause hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), the most common cause ofneonatal seizures [70]. Unfortunately, seizures are a common emergencyin the NICU, occurring in even 1 to 5 out of 1000 neonates born alive[50, 70, 64]. Neonates with a high risk of seizures are in need of criticalcare, as seizures damage the developing brain and are associated with apoor neurodevelopmental outcome [98, 30, 9, 46].Increasing excitatory synaptic activity or decreasing inhibitory activitycan cause hyperactivity of cerebral neurons, and when the excitation propa-gates, seizures can occur [42]. In the newborn brain, gamma-aminobutyricacid is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, and high chloride concentra-tions promote gamma-aminobutyric acid -mediated excitation [42]. Recur-rent seizures due to hypoxia alter ion concentrations in cortical structures,and these changes in concentration have been shown to persist even afterseizures have stopped [23]. Animal studies have shown that recurrentneonatal seizures reduce neurogenesis and increase apoptosis [54]. Withincreased seizure burden, the associated severity of brain injury increases,which could be reduced with early-onset treatment [93, 62]. Drugs thatmodulate chloride transport could be successful in reducing hyperactivitythat causes neonatal seizures [42].As early treatment has the highest chance of reducing seizure burden,it is of utmost importance to promptly and accurately detect seizures forimproved developmental outcomes. Detecting seizures based only on clin-ical signs, that is, by observing the movements of the neonate, revealsonly a fraction of neonatal seizures [55]. Accurate detection of seizuresrequires multichannel electroencephalography (EEG), which records elec-trical brain activity from multiple brain sites. This is the gold standard forseizure detection, as most seizures are only electrographic, presenting noclinical signs [67]. These EEG recordings, lasting hours or even days, are13Introductionvisually interpreted by clinical experts, such as clinical neurophysiologists.However, EEG is a complex signal that is difficult to interpret, especiallyin NICU, due to diffuse spectral manifestation of seizures on the EEGand many seizure-like artifacts that can contaminate a recording [82, 12].The expertise to identify seizures from the data is not always availableon demand, and interpretation of such long-duration recordings is verytime-consuming.To aid in the detection of seizures to guide interventions and predictneurological outcome, there is a pressing need for robust and reliableautomated seizure detection algorithms (SDA) for neonatal EEG. In recentdecades, many SDAs have been developed [52, 32, 16, 57, 22, 87, 7, 59].In any SDA development, the algorithmic detection of seizure and non-seizure, called annotation, is compared to the gold standard of humaninterpretation of the EEG. The integrity of the human annotation is crucialas it provides the benchmark for the SDA. However, human expert seizureannotations vary between observers, which must be taken into accountwhen evaluating algorithm performance [78]. In addition to traditionalevent-based and temporal measures, such as seizure detection rate, falsedetection rate, sensitivity, and specificity, a measure that takes into accountthe ambiguity of human annotation is needed. Before an SDA can beclinically approved, it must also be proven to yield an annotation thatprovides a clinically relevant representation of EEG. Additionally, thegeneralizability from one data set to another has to be shown for robustand reliable performance. This step requires large and representative open-access data sets, which have not been available before the publications ofthis thesis.The SDA proposed in the publications of this thesis incorporates thestrengths of two existing algorithms. The first algorithm implementedby Deburchgraeve and colleagues ([22]) used complex feature extractionpipelines tuned to the characteristics of a neonatal seizure, resulting ina small set of features classified by simple thresholding. Their algorithmessentially uses a time-varying segmentation of the EEG to separateepileptic spikes to assess spike correlation, a key feature for neonatalseizures [19]. Temko and colleagues ([87]) in contrast used a simple featureextraction pipeline, resulting in a large feature set classified by a supportvector machine (SVM). For our algorithm, we implemented a pipeline usinga limited, carefully designed set of features, classified by an SVM, andshowed improved results. We generated a feature set that would representthe characteristics of neonatal seizures, instead of using general time- andfrequency-domain signal features. The data set on which the algorithmwas developed and trained has been published to serve the entire field ofneonatal seizure detection, offering for the first time a fair comparisonbetween algorithms. The algorithm has also been published and integratedinto a neonatal cerebral function monitor software for automated seizure14Introductionannotation by a clinical neurodiagnostics company (ANT Neuro, Hengelo,The Netherlands). Their seizure annotation module is currently underFDA approval.Additionally, we have proposed a comprehensive set of performanceevaluation measures that we suggest to be used in further studies of au-tomated seizure detection. These include measures for generalizability,non-inferiority to human annotation and clinical efficacy. Generalizabilitymeasures are necessary to demonstrate that the algorithm performance issimilar between the training and validation data sets. These measures rep-resent the robustness of the algorithm to unseen data. The non-inferiorityanalysis compares SDA annotation to multiple human expert annotationwith measures of inter-observer agreement (IOA), to evaluate if automaticannotation can be distinguished from human annotations. Clinical efficacymeasures assess whether SDA produces a representative annotation of theEEG in terms of seizure burden.As the end result of this thesis, we have proposed an SDA that providesa clinically relevant representation of the EEG, generalizes to unseen dataand is non-inferior to human annotation. In addition, we have publishedthe training data set and the algorithm for further development and faircomparisons. Solely through open science we can reach the ultimate goalin the field: to improve treatment targeting and outcome prediction with adecision support system, in order to improve the patients’ quality of life.152. Aims of the studyThe aim of this thesis was to develop and validate a neonatal seizuredetection algorithm, which would detect seizures from EEG recordingswith a clinically acceptable level of performance.The aims can be summarized as follows:1. Construct a neonatal SDA that would perform sufficiently to replacea human expert and publish the data and software implementationfor reproducibility.• Design measures that would reflect the non-stationary periodiccharacteristics of neonatal EEG seizures and incorporate themwith other features into an SDA based on an SVM.• Define a measure for sufficient performance by means of inter-observer agreement.2. Validate the algorithm• Define performance measures to evaluate the goodness of thealgorithm in terms of generalizability, non-inferiority to humanannotation, and clinical efficacy by accurately representing thehourly seizure burden173. Background3.1 ElectroencephalographyThe central nervous system predominantly consists of neurons and gliacells [73]. Neurons are connected by synapses, which transmit informationbetween cells. When an action potential from a pre-synaptic cell reachesa synapse, neurotransmitters are released into synaptic cleft. Receptorson the post synaptic cell membrane bind these molecules, opening andclosing ion specific channels, and creating post-synaptic potentials. Thereis a negative resting potential over the cell membrane due to positive andnegative ions in the cellular and extracellular space, and this potential isaltered mainly by synaptic activity. Synapses can be either excitatory or in-hibitory, triggering excitatory or inhibitory post synaptic potentials (EPSPand IPSP). An EPSP depolarizes the post-synaptic neuron, and if the EPSPis larger than the membrane potential threshold, an action potential istriggered. Inhibitory synapses conversely trigger hyperpolarization, IPSP,in the post synaptic cell. Relatively slow events are required to achievea measurable signal. Synaptic currents are slow in comparison to actionpotentials and a primary source of measurable activity. Post-synapticpotentials predominantly contribute to extracellular field potentials thatcan be measured with EEG.EEG, when measured on the scalp of the human, is a non-invasivemethod to record electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. In the invasiveapproach, the electrodes are placed beneath the scalp, but this method isoutside the scope of this thesis, as we only used data recorded on the scalp.EEG electrodes measure the potential difference between two points witha submillisecond time resolution. Scalp electrodes are large in size relativeto the size of the underlying neurons, and therefore the measured activityis averaged over thousands of cells. Synchronized activity of spatially simi-larly oriented neurons sums up increasing the amplitude of the measuredelectric field, while desynchronization decreases the amplitude. In addition19BackgroundFigure 3.1. International 10–20 EEG recording system. Z refers to midline sagittal plane,A1 and A2 are reference points and AF refers to anterior frontal lobe. (BrylieChristopher Oxley, 2017). CC0 1.0.to synchrony, the amplitude of the measured voltage is affected by thespatial density, magnitude and sign of the individual current sources. Allneuron activities from fast processes to slow fluctuations contribute to thevoltage measured on the scalp. Pyramidal cells, being the most populousof neurons and causing substantial ionic flow when activated, are likely tocontribute the largest to EEG [13]. Analysing this electrical activity overtime provides information on the behaviour of cortical neurons and thestate of the brain.Electrode locations are standardized and positions are defined by theinternational 10–20 system [41]. The system uses skull landmarks tostandardize positioning in studies and patients around the world. The 10–20 system is presented in Figure 3.1. The numbers represent the lateraldistance from the sagittal line that delineates the left and right brainhemispheres. Even numbers refer to the right and odd numbers to the lefthemisphere. The letters reflect the distance along the anterior-posterioraxis. The electrodes are attached to an electrode cap, where the distancebetween the electrodes is 10% or 20% of the entire anterior-posterior orright-left distance measured on the skull.20BackgroundUsually, one electrode is used as a reference and the voltage differencebetween that reference electrode and all other electrodes is measured bythe EEG machine. This order of electrode pairs is called a referentialmontage. Standard clinical EEG recordings utilize either referential orbipolar montage [5]. Neonatal EEG recordings are typically analyzed froma bi-polar montage [73]. The primary advantage of a bi-polar montage liesin artifact removal, as they are reduced when more synchronized signalsfrom nearby electrodes are subtracted [5]. In addition to scalp electrodes,additional electrodes can be applied to measure the electrocardiogram andthe electromyogram, as well as additional sensors to record respiration.These electrodes might also provide useful information on seizure detection,as some artifacts might arise from these physiological sources.3.1.1 Neonatal EEGNeonatal EEG differs from adult and older child EEG in many aspects.First of all, the recording conditions are different, due to the patient’sinability to co-operate and the small size of the head. For neonates, afull set of electrodes from the 10–20 system is not feasible, and a reducedarray of electrodes is accepted [49]. In the first data set of our study, themaximum of 19 electrodes with a "double banana" montage (Figure 3.2) isused: Fp2-F4, F4-C4, C4-P4, P4-O2, Fp1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1, Fp2-F8,F8-T4, T4-T6, T6-O2, Fp1-F7, F7-T3, T3-T5, T5-O1, Fz-Cz and Cz-Pz. 8 or4 channel systems for neonates are in use for long-term EEG monitoring,while larger montages are mostly used to confirm the presence of suspectedseizures from short-term recordings. The second data set of this study used4 channels: F3, F4, P3, P4. Figure 3.3 shows a neonate with an EEG capdesigned especially for the head size of a neonate. Often a lower numberof electrodes is used in NICU, as the interpretation of the data from alarge number of channels is time-consuming or not available. However, thereduction of electrodes has been shown to decrease the number of detectedseizures [80].Background EEG is different in neonates compared to the mature brainof adults [73]. Patterns including continuity, synchrony between hemi-spheres, reactivity to stimuli, and sleep/wake cycling are all changingwhen the brain matures. The newborn EEG consists mainly of a mixtureof frequencies in the delta (0.5–4 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) frequency bands,and the total power in higher-frequency bands increases with age, whereasthe power in lower bands decreases [71]. Seizures in the developed adultbrain are accompanied by less complex waveforms. Additionally, seizureincidence is high on neonates [50, 64, 70], resulting in more balanced datasets. Due to these differences in EEG between newborns and adults, it isnot feasible to directly apply methods developed on adult EEG to neonates.However, some neonatal SDAs have been implemented by altering methods21BackgroundFigure 3.2. The typical electrode set up used to confirm suspected neonatal seizures, abipolar montage called "double banana".Figure 3.3. Neonate wearing a cap with EEG electrodes in the NICU (credit to HelsinkiUniversity Central Hospital).22Backgroundfrom adult seizure detection [31]. SDAs developed for neonatal seizure de-tection have been shown to function for the detection of seizures in adults[26, 48].Electrical recordings in neonatal intensive care are especially prone toartifacts. Sweat, movement, and muscular activity might disturb EEGmeasurements. In addition to the physiological signals originating outsidethe brain, interference can be caused by technical sources. One commonsource is mains electricity, which might be induced to EEG recordingfrom other monitoring equipment around the patient. Artifacts are nottrivial to detect and remove, especially in neonates with an underlyingpathological condition, and there has not been many algorithms developedfor this specific purpose [97]. However, for seizure detection, artifacts arenot as problematic as for other applications such as background signalclassification, since artifacts are rarely overshadowing seizure events andare most prominent in the non-seizure class.3.1.2 Amplitude-integrated EEGThe cerebral function monitor refers to technology of time and amplitudecompressed EEG, called amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). Originally,it was a one-channel method recording signal from bi-parietal electrodes.The signal is first band-passed filtered, then rectified, and the outputeffectively is a smoothed peak-to-peak amplitude displayed on a semi-logarithmic scale downsampled to approximately 1 Hz, where time islinear. Essentially, aEEG is a snapshot of the state of the brain, showingthe trend of amplitude over a long recording time. Due to its simplicity, ithas been widely adopted to monitor brain function recovery in newbornswith conditions such as HIE and stroke. However, due to the compressionand lack of spatial data, information is lost, and aEEG cannot be reliablyused as a stand-alone method for seizure detection [67].3.2 Neonatal seizuresSeizures are a common neurological emergency in neonates, occurring in 1–5 out of 1000 live births [50, 70, 64]. As not all seizures are clinically visibleand need EEG for recognition, this number is underestimated [55]. Clinicalsymptoms are observed in the video recording or on the cot side in theNICU, often accompanied with an EEG or aEEG recording. The recognitionof seizures is crucial and requires immediate medical attention, as they aretypically provoked by an acutely emerging illness or a brain insult. Thereare many sources of neonatal seizures, but most are caused by a relativelysmall number of etiologies. The most common underlying etiology ishypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) caused by perinatal asphyxia,23Backgroundfollowed by intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, infections, congenital corticalmalformations, as well as metabolic and genetic conditions [95, 70].Multichannel EEG is often accompanied with a video recording, to ob-serve movements of the neonate, as seizures can be recognized from clinicalsymptoms or from specific patterns in the EEG recording. Out of stud-ies using the video-EEG method, only 10% of neonatal electrographicseizures were shown to have a clinical correlate [55]. Clinical recognitionof seizures involves observing the movements of the infant and classifica-tion into groups of clonic (rhythmic jerking), tonic (muscle tone or stiffness),myoclonic (brief and sudden movements) and subtle (only subtle externalmotor manifestations) [94]. A seizure can also be detected from symptomssuch as sucking, blinking, chewing, or lip smacking. Seizures that canbe identified from an EEG recording but do not have a clinical correlateare called sub-clinical or electrographic seizures. Seizures may or maynot have clinically visible symptoms, but standardized detection requiresEEG recording [67]. The current guidelines state that seizures can only bedefined if they have an EEG correlate [75, 67].An example of a neonatal seizure compared to normal EEG activity ispresented in Figure 3.4. Clinical neurophysiologists often follow the def-inition of neonatal seizures by an international guideline. Seizures aredefined as "clear ictal events characterized by the appearance of sudden,repetitive, evolving stereotyped waveforms with a definite beginning, mid-dle, and end" [19]. More recently, the American Clinical NeurophysiologySociety defined a neonatal EEG seizure as "a sudden, abnormal EEG event,defined by a repetitive and evolving pattern with a peak-to-peak voltageof at least 2 µV and duration of at least 10 seconds" [90]. This defini-tion has very recently been updated by the ILAE Task Force on neonatalseizures with the following [67]: "An electrographic event with a patterncharacterized by sudden, repetitive, evolving stereotyped waveforms witha beginning and end. The duration is not defined but has to be sufficientto demonstrate evolution in frequency and morphology of the dischargesand needs to be long enough to allow recognition of onset, evolution, andresolution of an abnormal discharge." Notably, this latest definition relaxesthe requirement of duration.Seizures are often treated with a variety of anti-seizure drugs (ASD),but there is no evidence-based protocol on which ASD should be used, howaggressively, and for how long [92]. ASDs have possible neurotoxicity aswell [8], while their effectiveness has not been proved. Most cliniciansstill aggressively treat seizures with ASDs, as the outcome of prolongedseizure burden has been shown to include cognitive deficits as well asepilepsy later in life [69]. The seizure burden is defined by the cumulativeduration of seizure in a time window of, for example, one hour. Therapeutichypothermia has also become a standard procedure to reduce seizureburden and improve outcome [37]. However, both the administration24BackgroundFigure 3.4. An example demonstrating the characteristic spikiness and repetitiveness ofneonatal seizures compared to an epoch of no seizure.of ASD and hypothermia might disturb further detection of seizures byelectroclinical uncoupling [56]. That is, even if clinical symptoms would bereduced, electrographic seizures might not be affected.Although the mortality risk for full-term patients with seizures has inthe past decades decreased to about 10% [91], recent studies have shownthat seizure burden is significantly associated with an abnormal outcome[44, 46]. It has been suggested that a seizure burden greater than 30–60seconds per hour could be an indication to trigger treatment [77]. Therefore,accurate detection of seizures is important in order to accurately defineseizure burden to guide interventions.In the absence of clinically approved automatic seizure detection, long-term EEG recordings (sometimes with video) are manually marked by aclinical expert, such as a clinical neurophysiologist. The scoring criteriamay vary slightly from one clinic to another, but should be based oninternational definitions of seizures [19, 90, 67]. Generally, scoring meansthat the clinical expert scrolls through the multichannel representation ofthe data and marks to the EEG reader program periods he or she classifiesas seizure. Other markings might also be used, but in this thesis onlyhuman seizure annotations and an annotation of bad electrode contactautomatically generated by the EEG machine were taken into account.For reasons described above, timely identification of seizures is neededto guide interventions. Seizure detection is not trivial. It is affected by theexperience of the clinical expert, the number of channels, and is subjectivewith a high degree of inter-rater agreement [78]. Possible features thataffect the recognition of seizure patterns are the number of seizures inthe recording, duration, total seizure burden, seizure morphology andrhythmicity relative to overall background activity, and the use of ASDs25BackgroundFigure 3.5. Scoring by three clinical experts forms consensus segments (green) of seizureand non-seizure, as well as non-consensus segments (white). S stands forseizure and NS for non-seizure.[74]. Therefore, high-quality expertise is crucial for annotations usedin SDA development, as machine-learning algorithms are trained andtested against this gold standard. Additionally, to correctly benchmarkalgorithm performance, multiple expert annotations are required, so thatthe variability between experts can be taken into account when reachingtowards optimal algorithm performance. Due to the ambiguity of theannotations, the aim of a 100% agreement between a single expert and thealgorithm would not be reasonable, and therefore measures that take thisvariability into account are needed.Figure 3.5 demonstrates how a consensus annotation is created betweenthree experts. For instance, in the training phase of a machine-learningalgorithm, only segments where all experts had marked a non-seizure orseizure are used (green segments). Non-consensus parts are not used fortraining. Typically, seizures are marked on all channels, without specifyingin which channels the seizure is present at all times. Per-channel scoringgenerally does not provide important information for patient care and isvery time-consuming. However, for supervised machine-learning algorithmtraining, this is required and was performed for the training data set inthis thesis.3.3 Seizure detection methods3.3.1 ClassifiersTwo different types of supervised classification approaches have beenmostly studied for neonatal seizure detection: neonatal SDAs based oncarefully handcrafted features that are believed to clearly characterizeneonatal seizures without the need for a sophisticated machine-learningalgorithm and neonatal SDAs based on many simple signal features. Inheuristic methods, the thresholds for features need to be empirically de-rived, and for machine-learning approaches, the detection thresholds need26Backgroundto be optimized within the data. For machine-learning algorithms suchas the SVM, multiple model parameters need to be selected. The issue ofchoosing the right features and right model parameters has been overcomeusing deep-learning approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)have been the most used deep-learning method in neonatal seizure detec-tion in the deep-learning category. In the next sections, the basic principlesof the two most studied neonatal seizure detection classifier methods, theSVM and the CNN, are introduced.Support vector machineThe SVM is a machine-learning algorithm first introduced by Cortes andVapnik in 1995 [21]. It is a supervised classification method, discriminatingbetween two classes. Essentially, this technique attempts to define theseparating hyperplane with support vectors that maximize the marginbetween two classes. The SVM method is intuitive, the parameters canbe easily modified, and it is relatively powerful with small training datasets. It also tends to have the best performance of the older generation ofclassification techniques.The input for the SVM are, in neonatal seizure detection, the feature val-ues calculated from segments of EEG. The input features (xi) are classifiedusing weights and bias values (w and b) into the two classes of non-seizure(–1) or seizure (+1). i is the data point index. If the label of the class (yi)defines the class –1 or +1, the equation to classify each data point is(wT xi + b)yi1.≥(3.1)The equality in the above equation for each class expresses the borderplane, where all samples of that class are either of that plane or on oneside of it. To assign incoming data to one of the binary groups, the SVMneeds to learn these separating planes that are defined by the data pointsin the training set standing on that border, called support vectors. Theweights (w) are defined by the support vectors only. Figure 3.6 presentsa linearly separable case. For visualization purposes, only two featuresare shown as a two-dimensional case. The support vectors of the featurespace are the only relevant samples for a linear, hard-margin SVM, as thedecisions are based on these points.The distance, d, between the border planes can be defined using theequation of a distance from a point to a line, and the equations of theborder planes:wT x + bw||=2w,(3.2)∥stands for the Euclidean norm or L2 norm. To maximize this, so that no point falls between the∥∥∥.∥wheredistance, the goal is to minimizeborder planes (Equation 3.1).∥w∥∥27BackgroundFigure 3.6. Linear separation of two classes in 2D.

This can further be∥(3.3)The solution to Equation 3.3 can be found using Lagrange multipliertechniques.With multiple features, which are often required with complex clas-sification problems, the separation is a multidimensional problem, andhyperplanes are needed for separation. The requirement of finding a deci-sion surface in a multidimensional space that would not allow any falsedetections (finding a hard margin) is in many real-world examples impossi-ble to satisfy. To relax this requirement, a so-called soft margin techniquecan be utilized. Equation 3.1 is changed to(wT xi + b)yi1−≥ξi,(3.4)where ξi stands for the slack variable, relaxing the constraint. With this,the margin increases at the expense of some misclassified samples. The28BackgroundFigure 3.7. SVM decision boundary for a non-linearly separable data.

In this case, the so-called Kernel trick is applied. Using akernel function (like the radial basis function) the data from the originalspace can be mapped to a higher-dimensional space, where the classes canbe linearly separated. An example of two features is presented in Figure3.7.In case of radial basis function, the parameter to be optimized is sigma.Intuitively, the kernel scale parameters define the rate of non-linearity forthe separation. Low sigma values produce highly non-linear splits. Theoptimization of these hyperparameters can be performed, for example, bycross-validation, where data are split into subgroups for optimization. The290.2							0.3							0.4							0.5							0.6							0.7							0.8							0.9									1Feature	1-2-101234567Feature	2No	SeizureNo	SeizureNo	SeizureSeizureSeizureSeizureTraining	DataSVM	BoundaryBackgroundSVM classification output, is a signed value representing the distance tothe decision boundary (normalized feature space required). High scoresmean that the data are in the predicted class, and low scores mean theopposite class. The cut-off threshold between classes is not necessarilyzero. The decision threshold can be adapted according to the needs of aspecific application.Convolutional neural networkCNNs are a deep-learning method specialized in classifying data organizedin grids, such as images, as they are inspired by the processing in the(biological) animal visual cortex [38, 29]. Although CNNs are powerfultools for image recognition for computer vision, the input data do notneed to be an image. Also, one-dimensional vectors (like EEG) can beused for CNNs. Convolution layers of the network automatically learn toextract feature patterns from the input data by optimizing the convolutionkernels. The power of CNNs lies in exactly this, the automated featureextraction. There is no need for extensive feature development, as learningunique features important to each class is performed automatically. Thesefeatures become more complex from layer to layer, and finally the outputlayer combines the feature map into a probability of the detected class. Thestructure of the layers is fixed a priori, while the optimized parameters arethe weights of the convolution layer filters, called kernels. The differencebetween the output and the ground truth (that is, the loss function) isoptimized in a network training step.A typical CNN architecture is presented in Figure 3.8. The most typicallayer types for the CNNs are the convolution, pooling and fully-connectedlayers. In the convolution layer, a sliding window (a kernel, a matrix ofweights) is multiplying each element of the input, producing an activationmap (also called as a feature map). The number of features is the userdefined number of filters. Each kernel also includes a scalar quantity calledthe bias term. The convolution layer often includes a non-linear activationfunction, a rectified linear unit (ReLU), which effectively sets negativeelements to zero. This action function takes the feature map and outputsthe activation map. The output of the convolution layer defines whichfeatures were activated in which spatial locations, therefore retainingthe spatial information. Each convolution layer produces more and morecomplex features, as the receptive field increases with repeated convolutionprocesses. Therefore, the first feature maps learn higher frequency signalpatterns and the later maps lower frequency patterns.The pooling layer essentially downsamples the activation map by com-bining a cluster of neurons from the preceding layer into a single neuron.Typical pooling operations are max pooling and average pooling. Intuitively,max pooling takes the maximum value from the cluster and the averagepooling the average over neurons in the cluster. The network proposed in30BackgroundFigure 3.8. A visualization of a general CNN architecture. Feature learning phase consistsof repeating convolution layers (including ReLU layer) and pooling layers.Finally, the feature map is flattened into one dimension, and fed through afully connected layer into the prediction (Softmax) layer.Ref. [59] uses average pooling. Intuitively, the max pooling would look fora specific waveform, while with the average pooling we can quantify thewaveform. The fully connected layer is connected, as the name suggests, toall neurons in the preceding layer. Essentially, it can learn the non-linearcombinations of the features extracted in the last convolution layer. Thefinal layer after the fully connected layer is usually a Softmax layer, whichis a normalization activation function that outputs the probabilities of eachclass.Learning in the network happens by iteratively optimizing the weightsand the biases. The predicted probabilities from the Softmax layer arefed into a loss function (typically a categorical cross-entropy function).Categorical cross-entropy is effectively the negative natural logarithmof each predicted value. With an optimization algorithm (such as thestochastic gradient descent used in [59]) the loss is minimized.31Background3.3.2 Heuristic and machine-learning algorithmsMany automated SDAs have been developed since the early 1990s. Gener-ally speaking, a neonatal SDA aims to distinguish seizure segments fromthe non-seizure segments of the EEG signal. Usually, the algorithm outputis the final detection of either seizure or non-seizure based on an optimizeddetection threshold or the probability of each segment belonging to theseizure or non-seizure class. The problem with many of the algorithmspresented in the following sections is the lack of thorough performanceassessment and the lack of representative, heterogeneous data sets. Themost relevant SDAs developed for term neonates solely on the basis ofEEG will be presented. Studies utilizing heuristic and machine-learningapproaches are included.Heuristic algorithmsHeuristic algorithms essentially identify seizure-like activity patterns thatmimic the human observer [86]. They are derived from the empiricaldefinition of rules, thresholds, and parameters that clearly differentiateseizure activity from regular background EEG. The patterns of interestare repetitive spike-like patterns, as well as smooth oscillatory patterns.Heuristic methods were among the first to be explored for neonatal seizuredetection.Liu and colleagues [52] developed the first well known SDA method forneonatal seizures. Their method utilizes the property of autocorrelationfunction, which typically gives an irregular result for background EEG,whereas for the repetitive signal like seizure it is regular. This differencecould be used to detect rhythmic behaviour.A couple of years later, Gotman and colleagues [32] took into accountthe practice of neurophysiologists reviewing EEG also backward in time.The algorithm consists of three parts. The first one separates rhythmicdischarges by employing spectral analysis for feature extraction and thencompares these discharges to features calculated on preceding segments.The second method detects multiple spikes using an earlier method devel-oped by Gotman and colleagues [33] for the detection of adult EEG spikes.The third method perceives very slow rhythmic discharges, which requiresdifferent filtering compared to higher frequency discharges detected withthe first method. This algorithm was later validated on an unseen data set[31].The approach of Navakatikyan and colleagues [57] was aimed at de-tecting increasing regularity in parallel wave sequences of the EEG. Ap-proximately 10 s of EEG were compared to the moving average of thatsame segment. Critical points from the intersection of these two signalsprovides a method of defining fragments inside the segment, which werethen correlated to estimate regularity of the segment.32Table 3.1.

The spike-like activity is separated from thebackground utilizing the non-linear energy operator (NLEO), and theoscillatory patterns were detected using wavelet decompositions. Thismethod is also utilized in the development of our SDA and is thereforedescribed in more detail in Section 4.5.1. The algorithm was later validatedin a separate study [18]. Ansari and colleagues [7] combined the heuristicmethod of Deburgraeve and colleagues with a machine-learning method(the SVM), using the heuristic method as a pre-processor to find segmentsof interest.The summary of data sets and performance of these algorithms is givenin Table 3.1. Algorithms of Liu and colleagues and Deburchgraeve andcolleagues have been trained and tested on a low number of patients,whereas the SDA by Navakatikyan and colleagues has a high numberof patients, yet only 97 seizures in total in 17 patients. Gotman andcolleagues used recordings of various lengths from various centers, and 43of the patients had seizures. The problem of this data set is that it was pre-selected and therefore does not represent the true clinical setting. Gotmanand colleagues, however, further tested their algorithm on a separate dataset of 54 patients, where performance was reduced (sensitivity 66% andfalse detections per hour (FD/h) 2.3). The same selection problem standsfor the data set of Deburchgraeve and colleagues, where segments thatincluded seizures were pre-selected.Machine-learning algorithmsAnother way of approaching seizure detection is as a machine-learningproblem. Generally, each channel of the EEG is divided into segmentscalled epochs. For each epoch, a variety of signal features are calcu-lated which together represent the characteristics distinguishing neonatalseizure from regular background EEG. Typically, the features originatefrom three different domains: time and frequency domains, as well asinformation and chaos theory [24, 25]. The thresholds for decision making33Backgroundare learned from the data in the algorithm training phase.Thomas and colleagues [88] developed a neonatal SDA based on a gen-eral mixture model (GMM). The set of 55 features consisting of time andfrequency domain, as well as information theory features, was first trans-formed with linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysisto reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve classificationaccuracy. The transformed feature set was then fed into the GMM to obtainthe probability of seizure for each epoch.In the study by Temko and colleagues [87], the above-mentioned SDAwas replicated, with the change of replacing the feature transformationand the GMM with an SVM classifier. This classifier was used as thestate-of-the-art classifier to compare the performance of our classifier,and is thus described in more detail in Section 4.5.2. The algorithm ofTemko and colleagues was further developed and finally validated in aseparate study [53]. The final algorithm was called Algorithm for NeonatalSeizure Recognition, and was recently clinically trialled [63]. It is themost studied and the only clinically trialled neonatal SDA to date. Thestudy included data from 258 neonates, which were split into two groups:algorithm group and non-algorithm group. In the non-algorithm group,seizures were identified by clinicians based on continuous EEG alone. Inthe algorithm group, the decisions were supported by the SDA, giving analarm to the personnel when a pre-defined seizure probability thresholdwas reached. The identification of patients with seizures did not improvewith algorithm decision support, but the recognition of seizure hours wasimproved from a sensitivity of 45% within the non-algorithm group to66% in the algorithm group. The results were modest, but showed clinicalvalue, especially for clinics with a lower level of expertise. However, thisclinical trial did not provide a benchmark assessment that would definethe sufficient performance level for an SDA.An advantage of recent CNN-based methods is that raw EEG can beused as the input, without the need of filtering or other pre-processingprocedures. The idea of CNN is to learn abstract signal features, withincreasing complexity when going deeper into the network (that is, addingconvolutional layers).Single- and multichannel approaches have been proposed. Ansari andcolleagues [6] proposed a CNN-based algorithm combined with a randomforest (RF) for multichannel detection. The CNN was first trained to detectseizures, and after training, the last layers of the CNN were replaced withan RF to improve performance. In this way, the remaining layers of CNNwork as a complex feature extractor.O’Shea and colleagues [59] implemented a CNN-based single channeldetector, and later the same group published a multichannel approach[61]. These algorithms purely consist of convolutional layers, without anyfully connected layers. The advantage of a multichannel approach is the34Backgroundlack of need for a channel-by-channel label on the training data, reducingthe work load needed in the annotation phase. This over-channel labelingis called weak labeling. Tanveer and colleagues [85] followed a similarstrategy in designing their CNN-based neonatal SDA.Caliskan and Rencuzogullari [14] introduced a novel method in deeplearning for neonatal SDA based on transfer learning. In their approach,they utilized existing pre-trained deep CNNs, for instance AlexNet,GoogleNet, DenseNet and ResNet18, and adopted the last layers of thesenetworks to detect neonatal seizures. They claimed that this way therequired features for seizure detection are learned much faster withoutneed for a large training data set. The raw EEG was first converted toimages and used to tune the previously trained network’s last three layers,as well as to train a new conventional CNN for comparison. The bestresults were achieved using the DenseNet transfer learning approach.Isaev and colleagues [40] proposed an attention-based network on weaklylabeled EEG data. The method is based on a CNN, where a pre-channelfeature extractor block is connected to an attention-based multi-instancelearning layer [39]. The feature extractor block is based on inception blocks[84]. Multi-instance learning is utilized for handling weak labels, whileattention method highlights channels that most contribute to the highseizure probability in a given time frame.The summary of data sets and performance metrics is presented in Table3.2. In addition to area under the curve of the receiver operator character-istic (AUC) and accuracy values shown in this table, Ansari and colleaguesalso reported sensitivity, specificity, seizure detection rate (SDR) and FD/h(77%, 78%, 77% and 0,9, respectively). Many of these studies used ourpublished data set (Publication III), while O’Shea and colleagues and Isaevand colleagues used an additional data set. Most show a relatively highAUC values and even compare the performance to other existing algo-rithms. The problem, however, with all these studies is two-fold: lack ofthorough performance evaluation and lack of diverse data. Most of themonly evaluate AUC and accuracy, which do not answer the question ofwhether or not the level of performance is clinically relevant or acceptable.The second downside in these studies is the lack of heterogeneous trainingdata sets, as the most common or even the only etiology is HIE. Therefore,there is no evidence on how these SDAs would generalize to EEG withother etiologies.3.3.3 Outlier detectionEspecially in supervised learning, the machine-learning algorithm is onlyas good as the training data at hand. If a sample from an unseen dataset has qualities not presented to the algorithm in training, it might havetrouble in correctly classifying it. For instance, an artifact not present in35BackgroundTable 3.2. SDAs based on deep learning. The size of the data set as well as the reportedperformance are presented. N is the number of patients, AUC is area underthe curve of the receiver operator characteristic and ACC is accuracy. Theresults of the multichannel approach by O’Shea and colleagues (2020) arepresented, where AUC is evaluated on all patient recordings concatenated afterone another. The asterisks represent our published data set or a performanceevaluation on this data set.SDAAnsari et al., 2019O’Shea et al., 2020Caliskan et al., 2021Tanveer et al., 2021Isaev et al., 2020N4818,79∗39∗39∗31,39∗AUC83%98.5%, 95.6%∗99%99.2%ACC--97.9%95.6%92.7%, 80.7%∗-the training data or a seizure from a new etiology might cause missclassifi-cation. For generalizability of the algorithm, adding an outlier detectionstep can be useful.According to Grubbs [36], an outlier is defined like this: "An outlyingobservation, or "outlier", is one that appears to deviate markedly fromother members of the sample in which it occurs." The outlying detectioncan come from random variability inherent to the data at hand or anerror in data processing. In these cases a sample appearing as an outliershould be investigated. There are various methods to analyse a set ofsamples, in order to classify them into class of interest or as an outlier.Outlier detection can be divided into three essential computational groups:statistics-based (for example, proximity), neural networks (both supervisedand unsupervised), and machine learning (for example, SVM). In our work,the neural networks for outlier detection were not examined.3.3.4 Performance measuresIn order to fully assess performance of a neonatal SDA, various measuresare needed for a thorough analysis. Temporal, second by second measureslike sensitivity (also known as true positive rate) and specificity (or falsedetection rate) provide measures that take into account each epoch. A com-bination of these measures, the AUC, is probably the most commonly usedmeasure when assessing SDA performance. The curve is formed from sensi-tivity and specificity values over multiple detection thresholds. Sensitivityand specificity can be defined using the number of true positives (TP), truenegatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN): sensitivity= TP/(TP+FN), specificity = TN/(TN+FP). Additionally, accuracy has beenused widely in the literature. It is defined as (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+TN+FP).SDR and FD/h are common event-based methods. SDR is the numberof correctly detected seizure events, and FD/h represents the number of36Backgroundfalsely detected seizure events divided by the duration of the recordingin hours. Temporal and event-based measures are complementary, as forexample a few falsely detected, short duration seizures in a long durationrecording still might result in a high temporal performance. On the otherhand, high event-based performance does not take into account the dura-tion of the annotated seizure or the onset / end of the event. Therefore,both types of measures are needed.The above presented measures do not sufficiently assess the performanceof an SDA. A comprehensive set of measures was used in this study toestimate generalizability, non-inferiority to human annotation and clinicalefficacy. These measures are described in Section 4.8.374. Materials and methodsThe steps of the studies included in this thesis are described in Figure 4.1.The study started with a review of the literature regarding existing neona-tal SDAs. Many early SDAs have used refined heuristic rules for featureextraction and simple thresholding for detection (such as the method ofDeburchgraeve and colleagues [22]), while more recent algorithms haveextracted simple features and utilized automated optimal thresholding(such as the method of Temko and colleagues [87]) for more advanceddetection. However, we found that no algorithm had applied sophisticatedcomputational features that represent the visual characteristics of EEGseizures, and used automatically derived optimal thresholds for detection.To fill this gap, we incorporated existing methods of Deburchgraeve andcolleagues [22] and Temko and colleagues [87].Our first feature set only included representative time-domain character-istics of seizures; therefore, a further feature design was performed, andredundant features from the first version were dropped. To fill the gap inopenly available data sets and algorithms for neonatal seizure detection,the further developed SVM-based method was published along with thedata set used in training. As deep learning offered general performanceimprovements, a method based on both SVM and CNN was explored.These methods also included an outlier detection step, increasing robust-ness of the SDA to facilitate clinical implementation. However, since inthese experiments the results of all SDA versions (SVM, CNN, SVM+CNN,SVM+CNN+outlier detection) were comparable, we continued to the valida-tion stage with the published SVM-based method while exploring improvedoutlier detection methods. In the validation step, a collection of perfor-mance metrics was introduced in order to evaluate the generalizability tounseen data, non-inferiority to human experts and clinical relevance.39Materials and methodsFigure 4.1. A flowchart describing the steps in studies included in this thesis.4.1 Data setsIn SDA development and validation, it is crucial that data are representa-tive of the target population. Neonatal seizures can be caused by variousconditions, they are measured at different gestational ages, measurementdevices vary between centers and interpretation of the EEG is subjective.Therefore, the data sets that the SDA needs to be able to process are veryheterogeneous. The quality of the training data determines the quality ofthe resulting algorithm and care must be taken when collecting the cohort.What is sufficient in terms of cohort size is yet to be determined, but thelarger and the more diverse the data set is, the better. Optimally, the datawould be collected from multiple underlying etiologies, multiple centersaround the world with various EEG systems, with differing electrode den-sities, multiple expert annotators etc. However, this has not been possible,as no open-access data sets have been available.In our NICU, EEG recording is used as the standard of care in case ofsuspected seizures. In this thesis, we used two data sets recorded in theNICU of Helsinki University Hospital [83, 58]. The first data set was usedto develop the algorithm and train the SVM, while the second data set wasused for the validation of the SDA. Both data sets were recorded using thesame EEG system (Nicolet One, Natus Medical Incorporated, USA). Theethics committee of the Children’s Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital,had approved the use of the training EEG. The use of the validation datawas approved by the Institutional Research Review Board at HelsinkiChildren’s Hospital.The training data set consists of multi-channel EEG recordings fromhuman neonates, which are visually annotated by three human experts.40Materials and methodsThe 10–20 EEG system recordings were acquired from 79 term neonatesat the NICU of Helsinki University Hospital between 2010 and 2014.According to the independent annotations by three clinical experts, 39out of 79 had consensus seizures and 22 were seizure free. For collectingsamples for the SVM training, seizures were localized per channel as anadditional procedure. This short duration dense electrode paradigm ismainly used to confirm that the patient with suspected seizures actuallyhas seizures detected with EEG, the gold standard for seizure detection.With a large number of electrodes, the aim is to be able to detect even veryfocal seizures. The training data set has been made public [83] and canbe accessed in Zenodo [1]. The functions to read the data can be found onGitHub [2].The validation cohort is part of the larger cohort studied in [58]. The long-duration 4-channel recordings were annotated by two clinical experts. Oneof the experts was also annotating the training data set. The validationdata set consists of a cohort with 28 neonates, out of which 24 had seizuresmarked by both experts. The brain monitoring of the cohort was performedbetween 2011 and 2016. In contrast to training data, these recordingswere aimed at long-term monitoring and therefore used a reduced numberof electrodes. While the most common etiology in the training set is HIE, inthe validation set it is stroke. The summary of both data sets is presentedin Table 4.1, and more information can be found in References [83] and[58].4.2 Features for seizure detectionThere are two typical automated methods for neonatal seizure detectionon EEG. The first method is to mimic the clinician by searching for seizure-like patterns in the data with computational methods like auto-correlationand wavelet analysis [52, 57, 32, 22]. The second method used by morerecent algorithms is to extract generic data-driven signal features [88, 87].In the latter case, EEG features are general signal processing measuresin time or frequency domain or carefully designed features representingthe underlying characteristics of seizure events. EEG features might beused alone as a decision statistic, or combined with a machine-learningalgorithm, to classify segments of EEG into groups of seizure and non-seizure.As the gold standard of seizure detection for neonatal EEG is visualinspection, many features designed for the purposes of automated seizuredetection are trying to mimic signal aspects that human experts are lookingfor in the data. The features used in this study were partially implementedbased on the features used successfully in other neonatal SDAs [34, 87],and partly designed to represent key characteristics of the visual inter-41Materials and methodsTable 4.1.

In the first stage of the study, features fromthe SDA by Temko and colleagues [87] were implemented and tested onour data set, in addition to features inspired by the heuristic algorithmof Deburchgraeve and colleagues [22]. In the next phase, features thatcapture the essential characteristics of neonatal seizures were developed,and the final set of features included only a subset of features from Temkoand colleagues as well as a subset of features inspired by the SDA of De-burchgraeve and colleagues. Features of our algorithm can be divided intocategories of 1) time-domain features 2) frequency-domain features and 3)time–frequency domain features. All 21 features used in the proposed algo-rithm are shortly described in Table 4.2. Matlab functions implementingall these signal features can be found on GitHub [2].42Materials and methodsTable 4.2.

This characteristic has been represented by twowidely applied approaches both in the time domain, the autocorrelationfunction, and in the frequency domain, the Fourier spectrum [52, 31]. How-ever, implementing a signal feature capturing the repetitive characteristicsof neonatal seizure is a challenge due to the non-stationary characteristicspresented in Figure 4.2. In the first column, the artificial signal examplehas only one frequency component. In the second column, the harmonicfrequencies of the fundamental frequency are included. Finally, in the thirdcolumn, a simulated example of a neonatal seizure is presented. Here, theenergy of each frequency component is spread over multiple frequencies,while the frequency components vary over time. Therefore, the commonassumption of stationarity in EEG features is not fulfilled for neonatalEEG seizures, and more advanced signal features are needed to capturethis behaviour [15, 10, 68, 82]. To overcome this challenge, an adaptivesegmentation in the time domain, time–frequency matched filters, or anedge-linking procedure has been utilized to align the spectral peaks inthe time–frequency domain [57, 22, 47, 82]. In this study, we propose twonovel methods: spike correlation (adapted from the implementations ofNavakatikyan and colleagues and Deburchgraeve and colleagues [57, 22])and time–frequency correlation from a time–frequency distribution (TFD).4.3.1 Periodicity in neonatal EEGA periodic signal can be defined asx(t) = x(t + T ).(4.1)In this equation, t stands for continuous time, and T is the period. Inbiological signals, however, this strict definition cannot be met. By intro-ducing an error term (ϵ) and a time-varying period term, we can mitigatethis requirement. This relaxed definition for time-varying periodicity, thatis a reciprocal for instantaneous frequency [82], can be defined as follows:x(t)|−x(t + T (t))< ϵ.|(4.2)Both the frequency content and the scale of the neonatal EEG signalvary in time. The time-varying periodicity T (t) can also capture changes inthe morphology of the epileptic discharge. Seizures are not periodic, theyare repetitive and can repeat with and without changes in the underlyingmorphology of the epileptic discharge. Figure 4.3 presents two types oftime-varying periodicity in neonatal seizures: epileptic spikes repeatedin time where the shape is preserved, and spikes where the shape of the44Materials and methodsFigure 4.2. Signal harmonics are non-stationary over time for neonatal seizures. From leftto right: single-frequency component, fundamental frequency with harmonicfrequencies and a simulated example of a neonatal seizure.waveform is shifted both in time and in scale. The signal transformationsnecessary to capture these neonatal EEG properties are described in thefollowing sections.4.3.2 Correlation measuresSurrogate measures of the error term ϵ, presented in Equation 4.2, areused as a detection statistic for seizures in the proposed algorithm. Es-sentially, ϵ will be higher for non-seizure than for seizure class. ϵ is abetter parameter for discriminating seizure from non-seizure EEG thanhigh-precision estimates for time-varying periodicity, since estimates ofT (t) are more likely to overlap between seizure and non-seizure segments[79].To estimate the period (T ) and ϵ from a stationary signal, we can utilizethe autocorrelation function. This function compares the signal segmentwith time-shifted versions of itself. The signal period can be extracted fromthe autocorrelation function by finding local extrema. The autocorrelationfunction for stationary signals is defined as:Rx(τ ) = E[x(t)x(t + τ )],(4.3)45Materials and methodsFigure 4.3. Time-varying periodicity.

The period T is defined as, when τ > τ0, and τ0 is the time lag of the firstT = arg maxτzero-crossing in the autocorrelation function.Rx(τ ){}Rx(τ = T ) is a surrogate measure for ϵ. For a non-stationary signal, theperiod estimate becomes T (t) and the error term estimate Rx(t, T (t)). Toestimate a time-varying value for the period T (t) we use 1) a time-domaincorrelation that utilizes adaptive segmentation and 2) a frequency-domainmethod that utilizes joint time–frequency distributions.Time domain: The adaptive segmentation, which is employed to separateepileptic spikes from one another for spike correlation, is based on theNLEO,(4.4)ψx(n)= x(nl)x(np)x(nq)x(ns),}{−−−−−where discrete x(n) stands for the sampled EEG signal (at sample n), andl, p, q and s for discrete shifts in time [60]. For the purposes of derivingthe spike correlation feature, a moving average filter (7 samples, 110 ms)was applied for a smoothed NLEO (SNLEO). An example epoch of an EEGseizure is presented in Figure 4.4 A1 and the SNLEO of the epoch in A2.The threshold per epoch was adaptively selected, so that the thresholdresulting in the largest range of no change in the number of peaks (A2 toA3) was chosen. This adaptive thresholding defines the time incrementat which T (t) is updated. The correlation of the resulting spike segments(spike correlation, SC) was defined as follows:SCi,j = maxmRxixj (m)Rxixj (m; i, j) =E[xi(n)xj(n + m)]σxiσxj,(4.5)(4.6)where xi and xj represent EEG segments (i = [2, ..., S6], j = [i + 1, ...i + 5],where S is the total number of spikes), E is the expectation operator and σis the standard deviation of the EEG segment. Comparison of only nearbysegments is necessary, and the number of spikes was selected to be 6 as inthe algorithm of Deburchgraeve and colleagues [22]. The mean SC overEEG segments is the primary time-domain feature that represents thesurrogate error term as part of the final feature set (estimated from Figure4.4 A5).−Time–frequency domain: TFDs represent the distribution of signal energyin a joint time–frequency domain. A TFD can be considered as a sequenceof localized spectral estimates. We refer to a single spectral estimate as atime slice.For seizure detection, we use the TFD of a pre-whitened epoch of EEGas the base representation of EEG (Figure 4.4 B2). Pre-whitening was47Materials and methodsused, as it has been shown to amplify the difference between seizure andnon-seizure signals [16, 81, 82]. Each time slice in a TFD is compared to re-scaled versions of surrounding time slices (re-scaling captures a potentialshift in frequency from one time slice to the next). The frequency scale thatresults in a maximum correlation between nearby time slices can be usedas an estimate of instantaneous frequency, which is related to the time-varying periods according to IF (t) = 1T (t) . It is the maximum correlationbetween frequency-scaled time slices that is used as the surrogate of ϵ(Figure 4.4 B5). In this study, we utilized the most commonly used TFD,the Wigner–Ville Distribution:Wz(t, f ) =Pz(t, τ )e−j2πf τ dτ∫︂Pz(t, τ ) = z(t +τ2)z∗(tτ2),−(4.7)(4.8)where ∗ stands for complex conjugate of an analytic signal z(t). Equation4.8 is often smoothed (**, convolution) for further processing in 2D becauseof its oscillatory nature:ρz(t, f ) = Wz(t, f )∗∗tf γ(t, f ).(4.9)For smoothing, a 2D Hamming window (2.4 s duration and 1.6 Hz band-width) was applied. The smoothed Wigner–Ville Distribution was alsosub-sampled before calculations to decrease processing time.The time–frequency correlation (TFC) between time slices was calculatedasT F Ci,j = maxβRρ(β; i, j)Rρ(β; i, j) =E[ρ(i, k)ρ(j, kσρiσρjβ )](4.10)(4.11)where ρ(n, k) is the TFD, i and j are time slices (i = [1, ..., N4], j =[i+1, ...i+3], where N is the number of time-slices). β denotes the amount offrequency scaling, and k is discrete frequency. E is the expectation operatorand σ is the standard deviation of the segment. Figure 4.4 B describes theprocess of scaling the time slices, to find the maximal correlation. Stretchedand compressed versions of each time slice (ρ(j, kβ )) were achieved byapplying Hermite splines. β in Equation 4.11 is selected to only representa shift in frequency (1.25 Hz). The median TFC over time slices (Figure4.4 B5) is the final feature for periodicity in time–frequency domain.−±48Materials and methodsFigure 4.4. Estimates of the error term ϵ for signals with time-varying periodicity. In A,adaptive segmentation procedure is presented and in B the time–frequencycorrelation from slices of the TFD. The EEG signal in A1 is processed with anSNLEO (A2), and thresholded to locate peaks with adaptive thresholding (A3).Correlation between resulting peaks (A4) is then calculated. The final feature,mean SC, is calculated from these correlations (A5). In this case, the meanSC is 0.96. If stationary correlation had been used, the correlation wouldbe 0.36. B1 is a whitened segment of EEG, from which the time–frequencydistribution is then calculated (B2). Time-slices (B3) are scale shifted (B4)to find maximum of correlations (B5). This example results in the medianTFC of 0.73, while the correlation using frequency shifts instead of scale shiftswould be 0.38.4912345678Time (s)-100-50050EEG (µV)B12468Time (s)B2PowerTemps3s4s5B31234Frequency (Hz)PowerTempss3ss4ss5B41234567120.6530.630.7140.640.770.8450.760.830.9660.870.840.8370.710.710.6980.670.750.60B5A: Spike correlationB: TF correlation-100-50050EEG (µV)A10674Thresholds810121416Peaks (n)thA212345678Time (s)050010001500SNLEO (µV2)thA312345678Time (s)-100-50050EEG (µV)*12345678910*A412345678921.0031.000.9840.991.000.9950.990.991.000.9860.960.920.970.910.9170.970.970.950.950.9180.910.970.970.900.9690.990.990.970.970.91100.980.900.960.960.90A5Materials and methods4.3.3 Supporting featuresAs no single feature has been shown to sufficiently discriminate betweenseizure and non-seizure, we selected 19 features in addition to the meanSC and the median TFC. The first subset of additional features was derivedusing the SNLEO. These features were: the standard deviation (SD) of theSC, the mean, SD, and skewness of the SNLEO, the maximum SNLEOaveraged across all detected spikes, as well as the number of spikes, du-ration and inter-spike interval. In addition, a measure of the regularityof SNLEO was incorporated. For this measure, an SNLEO epoch wassub-sampled into 2-s non-overlapping segments and the SD between thesesegments was used as a regularity feature.Furthermore, the power spectral density (PSD) was estimated using theWelch method. Of this spectrum, the relative spectral power in severalfrequency bands (0.5–4 Hz, 4–8 Hz, 8–12 Hz and 12–30 Hz) correspondingto the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, as well as the mean spectralpower over the entire spectrum, were derived as features. These frequencybands are generally used to describe EEG activity. Out of the powerspectrum, measures analogous to total harmonic distortion were alsoextracted; the power of the fundamental frequency and of the first threeharmonics relative to the power over the entire spectrum as well as themaximum frequency of the PSD were estimated. The last additionalfeature for the features in the time–frequency domain class was a time-varying estimate of spectral distortion, to extract the maximum powerratio between the non-stationary signal components and the spectrum.This concept is similar to the feature described in Ref. [82]. The feature isdefined as1Ni=0 max(ϱ(i, k))KNk=0 ϱ(i, k)−−∑︁i=0−11,(4.12)where N is the number of time slices, i stands for discrete time, k fordiscrete frequency, K stands for maximum frequency, and ϱ is the smoothedshort–time Fourier transform.∑︁∑︁Finally, we added the mean of the amplitude envelope based on theanalytic associate of the EEG signal (calculated using Hilbert transform asin Ref. [89]) into the feature set. The transformation generates a complexsignal by phase-shifting the EEG and combining it with the original EEGsignal. The resulting signal is the analytic associate of the original EEGsignal, and its magnitude is used to derive the amplitude envelope. Themean amplitude envelope essentially approximates the standard deviationof the signal. As the amplitude of the EEG is one of the clinically relevantfeatures when visually inspecting the EEG, the mean amplitude envelopecomplements our feature set, which consists primarily of features focusingon the frequency content of the signal.50Materials and methods4.4 Seizure classification4.4.1 ClassifiersSVM was selected as the classification algorithm for this study, as imple-mentations are readily available (e.g. fitcsvm() function in Matlab). Ourdata were poorly linearly separable, and therefore we used non-linearseparation. In this study we decided to use a Gaussian radial basis kernelfunction. The hyperparameters, the box constraint, and the kernel scaleparameters were optimized before the final training of the SVM. We usedthe automatic optimization built in to the fitcsvm function, which uses a se-quential minimal optimization solver by default, when no outlier detectionis included in the optimization process. The leave-one-patient-out crossvalidation included an internal 5-fold Bayesian optimization to select boxconstraint and sigma. In the final SVM training for unseen validation data,the entire training data set (79 patients) was applied. The decision thresh-old was optimized within the training data samples against annotation byhuman experts.As CNNs have been shown to improve performance over SVM-basedclassifiers [59], we decided to experiment with a method that utilizes bothSVM and CNN. The CNN architecture used was similar to the one ofO’Shea and colleagues [59], which was adopted in our hybrid approach asa pre-processor. This method is similar to the one of Ansari and colleagues[6].4.4.2 Outlier detectionThe SVM-based outlier detection approach for the hybrid SDA was se-lected because it was readily available and straightforward to implement.The only extra step was to train an additional SVM, which can be time-consuming. In the hybrid SDA we utilized Matlab’s built-in function foroutlier detection, using one-class learning (Matlab fitcsvm). The biasterm of the SVM score function was optimized so that the fraction of sus-pected outliers has negative scores. This was performed as an additionalpost-processing step and the structure of the whole hybrid algorithm ispresented in Figure 4.6.The outlier detection method applied for the hybrid SDA only introducedincremental improvements on performance. Therefore, for the final versionof the SDA we studied other methods of outlier detection. The aim wasto find a simple and easily implementable approach. The most straight-forward and simple outlier detection methods come from the group ofstatistics-based methods. An example of proximity-based techniques is thek-nearest neighbours (kNN) technique [27]. In this approach, data that51Materials and methodsfalls sufficiently far from the data distribution of the training set is con-sidered as an outlier. The kNN outlier detection process is simple, but thecomputational complexity grows exponentially with a growing referencesample group. For the purposes of this study, this was deemed not to be anissue, as the size of the reference set (the training set) is relatively small.Matlab’s knnsearch function was utilized in the final SDA outlier detec-tion step. The basic idea of kNN is to calculate distance of a new sampleto a set of samples classified as normal data. Multiple distance measurescan be used, such as the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance. In our finalalgorithm, we tested multiple distance measures. Between many best per-forming distance metrics there were only incremental differences, and dueto its simplicity purely being a vector distance, the Euclidean distance wasselected. An unseen sample having a distance greater than the optimizedthreshold with the k-nearest neighbours in the training data set would bemarked as an outlier. The detected outlier segments were also extendedin time using a collar. The collar length, as well as the number of neigh-bours and threshold distance were optimized to maximize the agreementto human consensus annotation.An example of outlier detection is presented in Figure 4.5. The blackoutlier boundary covers distances of the 3 nearest neighbours in the data.In this case, the normal class is the seizure and non-seizure samples,and new samples (yellow samples) detected as outliers are marked tobe of non-seizure. This approach follows the principle of primum nonnocere. In addition to kNN approach, we removed high amplitude segments,which might originate from artefacts unknown to the SVM. The thresholdamplitude was also optimized against human consensus annotation.4.5 Comparison to reference methodsOur initial aim was to implement an SVM-based detector that would com-bine features that represent the characteristics of neonatal EEG seizuresto form a decision statistic. The feature set is partly adapted from thetwo SDAs that are presented in the following sections, the Deburchgraevealgorithm, which is based on heuristic spike correlation rules, and theTemko algorithm, which is an SVM-based bag of features solution [22, 87].These two methods, the SVM classifier and spike detection, were alreadycombined in a study, where the SVM was used as a post-processor to thespike correlation method [7]. However, this method does not overcome theissues of the two separate methods: 1) the spike correlation method cannotdefine EEG features, and 2) it cannot be algorithmically trained.Therefore, our approach is to incorporate the spike correlation methodinto features that represent important signal characteristics of neonatalseizures, so that together with other signal features, the SVM can combine52Materials and methodsFigure 4.5.

The features were chosenarbitrarily from the full feature set.53Materials and methodsthem into a decision statistic. In addition, we implemented both of thesealgorithms alone, so that the performance of the proposed algorithm couldbe compared to the two well-known methods.4.5.1 Deburchgraeve algorithmThe key element of the algorithm of Deburhgraeve and colleagues [22] wasthe combination of two types of seizure detection: 1) the detection of spiketrains and 2) the oscillatory behaviour. The algorithm searches for thesetwo types of patterns in the EEG data. The aim was to mimic the humanobserver, to find the most important visual characteristics that could beturned into an automated analysis method.The spike-train detection method first separates spike-like segmentsand then analyses the similarity between the segments. To localize thespike-like segments, they used the NLEO [43], which magnifies the spik-iness compared to the background signal. The operator was applied inoverlapping epochs. To extract the segments, an adaptive threshold wasapplied, including only high energy parts of the operator. As a humanobserver is comparing the seizure like activity to the background whenanalyzing the EEG, they included a measure for spikiness, to furtherdiscard epochs of too low spikiness. To compare spike segments to eachother, cross-correlation between neighbouring spikes was calculated. Thespike train was increased in length (that is, new spikes were added to thetrain) if the cross-correlation remained higher than a selected threshold. Aseizure detection required a minimum of six spikes in a train. Therefore,in our SNLEO spike correlation measure we are comparing six subsequentspikes. The aim of separating and locating spikes is similar to the algo-rithm of Navakatikyan et al. [57]. Natus (Middleton, Wisconsin, USA) hasimplemented their algorithm for clinical use in a CFM system.For the oscillatory behaviour, the algorithm searches amplified low-frequency activity. This activity can be detected using the autocorre-lation function [52]. To search for activity in a specific frequency range,Navakatikyan and colleagues [57] used wave sequences in their method ofseizure detection. Inspired by their method, Deburchgraeve and colleaguesextracted wavelets using the discrete wavelet transform. Wavelets corre-sponding to frequency sub-bands between 1 and 8 Hz were utilized. Usinga sliding window on a derivative of each scale, an increase in low-frequencyactivity is detected as suspected seizure. On these segments of interest,the autocorrelation function is applied to confirm repetitiveness in the seg-ment. Autocorrelation function is symmetric around zero for an oscillatorysignal, and therefore the skewness of the function is low compared to theskewness of a random signal. Both of these characteristics, symmetry andskewness, were used to detect an oscillatory seizure.In our SDA the NLEO was further smoothed for a more robust and54Materials and methodsTable 4.3.

Table 4.3 presents all the features adapted fromthe Deburchgraeve algorithm. The number of spikes corresponds to theminimum length of the spike train in the original algorithm, while thespike width feature is associated with the maximum search range forspikes, which was dependent on the width of the detected spike segment.Our main feature derived from their algorithm is the mean spike cor-relation, that represents the spike train correlation from the repetitivebehaviour of the neonatal seizure. In our version, the selection of spikeswas improved, as we used an adaptive threshold to delineate spikes. Outof the autocorrelation function we implemented the wavelet coefficients,skewness, and zero-crossings, representing the detection of oscillatorybehaviour. As the autocorrelation assumes stationarity of the signal, thesefeatures of the autocorrelation group were left out of the final feature set.For comparison purposes, we implemented a feature based version of theDeburchgraeve algorithm as well as a heuristic version according to theinformation available on their original publication.4.5.2 Temko algorithmThe algorithm of Temko and colleagues [87] is the most studied neonatalSDA that has also been validated with an unseen data set [53]. It isbased on a set of general signal features, which are combined with anSVM, and trained with a large set of neonatal EEG. The features chosenhad been shown to be useful in a number of studies for neonatal seizure55Materials and methodsdetection [32, 3, 25, 35]. The description and importance of these featureshas been discussed in [34]. Temko and colleagues also implemented severalpost-processing steps: a sigmoid function to convert the SVM output intoposterior probabilities, a moving-average filter for smoothing, thresholdingthe signal into binary decision, a logical OR operator over channels, anda collar operation extending the detection in both directions in order tocompensate the potentially missed beginning and end segments of seizure.Our interpretation of their SDA is based on feature descriptions avail-able on the original publication, which might introduce differences to theoriginal algorithm. We also train on a different data set, with differingetiologies, electrode numbers and data size, which all introduce differencesto results. In the initial stage of our algorithm development, we tested allTemko features and ended up with a subset in our final feature set. Theentire feature set is presented in Table 4.4. The only features adopted toour final feature set from the Temko set were the normalized (or relative)power in frequency sub-bands delta, theta, alpha and beta, as well as arepresentation of changes in amplitude and the non-linear energy.The general pipeline of the Temko algorithm is similar to ours. Onlyminor differences in the pre- and post-processing steps were applied. Wedid not construct the SVM classifier ourselves, but instead used the Mat-lab library of functions. Both Temko and our proposed SDA utilized aradial basis function kernel and a leave-one-patient-out method in thetraining and testing phase. Instead of the OR operator, we applied theMAX operator over each channel output after smoothing. The full listof pre- and post-processing steps is presented later in this chapter. Themost important difference is our carefully designed feature set, which isseparating our proposed algorithm from the Temko algorithm.4.6 Structures of the proposed algorithms4.6.1 Hybrid algorithmAs the performance of our initial algorithm within training data set didnot reach the benchmark performance of the human observer, we decidedto try a combination of our algorithm with another recently publishedCNN-based algorithm [59]. The proposed hybrid SDA combines the outputof a CNN, a complex feature extractor, and other features with an SVMinto a decision statistic. The aim was to increase performance by mergingthe advantages of each method into one single SDA. This hybrid approachis similar to that of Ansari and colleagues [6]. They also utilized the CNNas a complex feature extractor, but fed the output to a decision tree insteadof an SVM. In addition to incorporating CNN output, an outlier detection56Materials and methodsTable 4.4.

The structure of the hybrid detector combining SVM and CNN outputs.post-processing step was included in our hybrid SDA, as explained in theSection 4.4.2. The structure of the hybrid SDA is introduced in Figure 4.6.The CNN architecture was essentially similar to that proposed in Ref.[59]. In the SDA by O’Shea and colleagues, the structure of the CNNwas the following: 6 convolutional layers each followed by a ReLU layer,batch normalization with average pooling layers in the middle, and theglobal average pooling as the last layer before the Softmax layer, whichtransforms the value into probabilistic output. In our version, the onlydifferences were the different input size (16 second epochs sampled to 512samples instead of 8 second epochs sampled to 256 samples) and the finallayer. In our SDA we used a fully connected layer instead of an averagepooling layer, as we were using the CNN output as input to the SVM.4.6.2 Final algorithmAs the performance with the hybrid SDA using both CNN and SVM wasonly incrementally higher, and SVM-based algorithms are in general moreintuitive to interpret, the final SDA only used the SVM to combine featuresinto a decision of seizure or no seizure. The structure of the final SDA ispresented in Figure 4.7. This algorithm structure is otherwise identicalto the original published SDA, yet includes a step of outlier detection,which was optimized for agreement with human annotation. kNN method58Materials and methodsFigure 4.7. Structure of the final SDA with improved outlier detection. Raw EEG isfirst pre-processed, before features are extracted per epoch. The features arethen fed into the SVM, and the output decision statistic is post-processedbefore making the final binary decision. On the second row, the outlier step ispresented. Finally, the three groups of performance measures are extracted,namely: generalizability, non-inferiority and clinical relevance.was used to mark samples far away from the training feature space asoutliers. Additionally, the segments marked as "bad electrode" and theepochs with high amplitude were discarded. Very high amplitudes oftenrefer to possible artefacts. The pre- and post-processing steps used aredescribed in the next section.4.7 Pre- and Post-processingAfter reading the EEG file into Matlab, the data were first cleaned from thefrequency component caused by power lines, in Finland 50 Hz. This wasfiltered out by a notch filter. The next step was downsampling. The EEGdata used in this study were acquired with sampling frequencies of 256 Hzand 250 Hz. In our study, we used a sampling frequency of 64 Hz to speedup further signal processing steps. As some signal features might requiredifferent filtering parameters than others, the next step in pre-processingwas segmentation. The data were further processed in short segments,epochs, which were sampled every 4 seconds per EEG channel. Data werethen high-pass filtered per epoch before feature calculation, as very lowfrequency waveforms (<0.1–0.5 Hz) are not useful for seizure detection inneonates. Sweat artefacts are most prominent on frequencies lower than0.5 Hz, and the seizure activities of interest are above that frequency [4].This high-pass frequency was also utilized in the NICU.The feature extraction process also included discarding samples markedwith "bad electrode" by the EEG monitor and epochs with impedance checklasting more than half of its duration. The extracted features were then fedinto the SVM, which outputs decision values every four seconds for eachchannel. These values, that are distances to the separating hyperplane,were smoothed with a moving-average filter of three samples. Whileseizures are not necessarily present in all channels, and in this study theaim was to detect all seizures that occur, a maximum operator was appliedover the channels. This signal was then further smoothed by a median filterof three samples (12 s) to provide a more stable decision statistic. Since the59Materials and methodsSVM output had a resolution of 4 seconds due to overlapping segmentationprocess, the smoothed decision values needed to be up-sampled for directcomparison with second by second annotation by the human experts.Before any performance measures could be calculated, the continuousdecision values needed to be converted into a binary decision representingseizure and non-seizure. The human annotations were also in binaryformat. As by the definition of neonatal seizure, the minimum duration ofseizure is 10 s, all SDA detections shorter than 10 s were discarded. Finally,the detections were extended in time using a "collar", either backward andforward or forward only. In the first study, a forward collar was used, whilein the validation study, with a different optimization procedure, we had acollar that extended detections both backward and forward in time.4.8 Measures of performance4.8.1 GeneralizabilityIn this study, we evaluated common temporal measures, sensitivity, speci-ficity and AUC, and widely used event-based measures, SDR and FD/h.The "gold standard" in case of seizure detection is the human annotation.For sensitivity and SDR, non-consensus annotation segments were as-signed to non-seizure, while for specificity and FD/h, all detected seizures,even the non-consensus ones, were assigned to seizure. Non-consensusannotation refers to segments of EEG, on which the annotations of theclinical experts differed. Measures were calculated both on a per patientbasis and on concatenated data (all patient data linked one after the otherto form one long annotation). As the AUC/sensitivity and the SDR cannotbe calculated on non-seizure patients, concatenated measures take alsothese patients into account. Additionally, for shorter recordings with onlya few events, an event-based analysis might provide misleading results, asthe granulation is limited (for a 1h recording, FD/h can only be integers).We calculated these measures in cross-validated assessments on thetraining data set. In the validation phase, these measures could be usedto compare performance between two data sets. The measures calculatedon the validation data set were compared to the cross-validation results.We claim that if the statistical difference between the two data sets isinsignificant, the algorithm generalizes to unseen data. As the AUCcombines two measures, sensitivity and specificity, and is additionally themost commonly used measure for SDA performance evaluation, it wasselected to be our primary measure of generalizability. Mann-Whitney Utest was used to test difference between performance measures on trainingand validation data sets.60Materials and methods4.8.2 Non-inferiorityThe measures mentioned above are the classical measures to estimate SDAperformance and provide means to assess generalizability. However, theydo not provide benchmark performance for a machine-learning algorithm.Human annotation is known to have some variability depending on variousfactors such as the length of the seizure, the number of recording EEGchannels and the number of events [78]. The temporal and event-basedmeasures do not suffice on their own to determine human equivalence ornon-inferiority. Therefore, the sufficiency of the SDA needs to be deter-mined by a more rigorous statistical analysis.We used the IOA as the key measure of assessment. It is a measureof variability between experts, for which we use either Fleiss’s kappa(when there are three annotators available) or Cohen’s kappa (for twoannotators) [20, 28]. It is commonly used as a measure of IOA and isa singular measure, unlike, for example, sensitivity, which needs to beinterpreted in conjunction with specificity [72]. Kappa can be evaluatedeither between human-only annotations, or one human annotation can bereplaced with the algorithm annotation. More importantly, the differencein kappa distributions between all human annotations and a compositeSDA/human annotation provides us with a measure for non-inferiority. Inour studies we have defined an SDA to be non-inferior to human annotation,when the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference distribution ofkappa values spans zero. This procedure is similar to the two one-sidedt-tests. The distribution was formed by bootstrapping the patient data(with replacement) for 1000 iterations. The agreement using kappa wasthen calculated for all these iterations, and the distributions of the twogroups (all human vs human/SDA composite) were then subtracted fromone another. The process of replacing one human annotation with analgorithm annotation was repeated for all annotators. If for any replacedexpert, the 95% CI of the difference distribution spanned zero, the SDAwas declared non-inferior to human annotation.4.8.3 Clinical efficacyEven if the algorithm would provide an annotation that can replace ahuman annotation and generalizes to unseen data, we still need proof thatthe annotation generated by the algorithm delivers clinically relevant re-sults. A widely used measure to aid clinical decision making for treatmentand outcome prediction is seizure burden [66, 46, 65]. In this study, clinicalefficacy was defined by a clinically relevant interpretation of EEG. TheSDA was therefore compared to human annotation by measures of seizureburden.Hourly assessment of seizure burden was compared using a diagnostic61Materials and methodsbinary decision for periods of interest (POI). Clinical POIs were defined asa 2-hour period containing at least two seizures lasting for 30 seconds or 3minutes of accumulated seizure. The number of these targets recognizedby the SDA and annotated by clinicians were compared. The purpose ofthis measure was to assess the ability of SDA to find periods of clinicalinterest.According to recent work, a high total seizure burden (>45 min) as wellas a high hourly seizure burden (>13 min per hour) in a long duration EEGrecording can predict a poor neurodevelopmental outcome for a neonate[46]. The high and low seizure burden predictions were compared betweenthe human consensus annotation and the SDA to assess the efficacy of theSDA in predicting the outcome.625. Summary of results5.1 Preliminary resultsIn Publication I we experimented with epoch length, feature set, andSVM training. The main performance measure used for comparisons wasthe AUC. The key outcome of this paper was the implementation of themean SNLEO spike correlation, which represents the neonatal seizurecharacteristics, resulting in a relatively accurate discrimination betweennon-seizure and seizure epochs as a stand-alone feature (Table 5.1). How-ever, the AUC increased when features of the Temko feature set wereadded to the SNLEO feature set, demonstrating that the features basedon the SNLEO do not suffice alone, and additional features representingother signal characteristics are needed. The method with a set of SNLEOfeatures was significantly better than the AUC of the standalone spike cor-relation feature (p = 0.040). Furthermore, the method combining SNLEOfeatures with features of the Temko algorithm significantly outperformedthe SNLEO feature method (p < 0.001). A two-sided Wilcoxon signed ranktest was used to compare statistical difference. Also, longer epochs (32 s)and a non-linear SVM were shown to improve performance.Table 5.1.

For the finalalgorithm, we developed features representing the non-stationary periodiccharacteristics of neonatal seizures. The main features are the meanspike correlation (mean of SC) and the median time–frequency correlation(median TFC). The SC was defined as the maximum cross-correlationbetween time lagged segments of the EEG epoch, whereas the TFC wasdefined as the maximum cross-correlation between time-slices of a TFD,which were shifted in time and scale. In a single feature analysis thesefeatures performed well and they were among the three best performingfeatures together with Spectral Power (log). The AUCs for single featureperformance are presented in Table 5.2.Together with other measures derived from the SNLEO and scaled TFDs,SVM was trained with a leave-one-patient-out paradigm, resulting in amedian AUC of 0.988 for consensus seizure patients. These results provedthat measures depicting the non-stationary periodicity by the means ofcorrelation discriminate well between seizure and non-seizure, while addi-tional measures are needed to represent the full characteristics of neonatalEEG.In this publication we additionally compared the performance of ourSDA to our implementations of two well known algorithms, the SDAof Deburchgraeve and colleagues (SDADB) and the SDA of Temko andcolleagues (SDAT ) [22, 87]. Furthermore, as the original SDADB cannotbe trained, we implemented a modified version of the algorithm, SDAmDB,where the heuristic rules of the original algorithm were defined as EEGfeatures. The comparison of all feature-based algorithms in terms ofsensitivity and specificity is presented in Figure 5.1, showing the superiorperformance of our SDA compared to our implementations of the other twoSDAs, SDAT and SDAmDB. The proposed algorithm also outperformed theother implementations in seizure detection rate. The summary of the keycomparison results, for AUC and kappa, are presented in Table 5.3. Themean κ takes into account non-seizure patients, whereas the AUC doesnot.64Summary of resultsFigure 5.1. Comparison of SDA performances against human consensus annotation (N =39).

We definenon-inferiority using the 95% CI of the distribution of ∆κ (Fleiss’/Cohen’skappa) for differences in inter-observer-agreement. ∆κ is calculated be-tween all human annotations and all combinations of one human expertreplaced with the algorithm annotation. If any of these comparisons resultsin a 95% CI spanning zero, the algorithm is declared non-inferior to humanannotation. In this publication with the proposed SDA, this benchmarkwas reached with 92% of the patients. For comparison, the second bestperforming SDA implementation, SDAT by Temko and colleagues, wasnon-inferior to human annotation with 24% of the patients.5.3 Open-access databaseIn Publication III we published the data set used in the SDA development.Openly available multi-channel neonatal EEG, annotated by multiplehuman experts has been the bottleneck of algorithm development and didnot exist before this publication. Therefore, this publication was a crucialstep in our aim to promote SDA development and comparisons betweenexisting algorithms. The data set annotated by three experts offers thepossibility to include the subjectivity of the annotations in the analysisof performance. On the 27th of November 2022 the data set had beendownloaded 10662 times and the paper has been referred to 73 times.The structure of the database is summarized in Figure 5.2. The EEGdata have been stored with clinical details and three experts’ annotations.Annotations have been made using weak labels, but one annotator providedinformation on the spatial distribution of consensus seizures as well. TheEEG recordings are stored using a referential montage.5.4 Hybrid algorithm resultsIn Publication IV we combined our method with an implementation of anexisting CNN-based SDA, attempting to improve seizure detection perfor-mance. Furthermore, this hybrid SDA study included an outlier rejectionstep to add robustness to unseen data. In this paper, different versionsof SDAs were compared: SVM, CNN, SVM+CNN, SVM+CNN+outlier de-tection and finally SVM+CNN+outlier detection with increased minimumseizure duration (from 10 s to 30 s). All versions achieved comparableresults and were non-inferior to human annotation (Figure 5.3 A). The bestperforming SDA was depending on the performance measure at hand. Thelargest improvement for IOA (the measure to determine non-inferiority tohuman expert) was achieved when using the 30-s minimum seizure dura-66Summary of resultsFigure 5.2. The structure of the database. The EEG file and annotations are linked withthe identification number (1 to 79). Functions for reading the EDF-files canbe found at https://github.com/ktapani/Neonatal_Seizure_Detection.tion. This effect is shown in Figure 5.3 B. As this increase in minimumseizure duration does not significantly alter the detected seizure burden,and the IOA between experts has been found to be lower for short dura-tion seizures, the use of a prolonged minimum duration can be justified.However, as it is not an approved definition of neonatal seizure, and thetask force no longer sets a minimum seizure duration [67], the traditional10 s was used in further studies.Another important finding in this study was superior performance withan epoch length of 16 s instead of 32 s. The 32 s epoch length was optimizedon the main features of the SDA, which based on the results of this hybridstudy, does not translate to all features combined. Therefore, the 16 sseizure duration was selected for the final validation study as well.5.5 Validation resultsIn Publication V, we validated our SDA developed in PI–II and PIV. Thisfinal version of the SDA included an outlier detection step to achievemore robust performance on unseen data. We suggested measures toevaluate the goodness of the algorithm compared to human annotation andto determine relevance for clinical practice: 1) generalizability to unseendata, 2) non-inferiority to human annotation and 3) clinical efficacy.First, we needed to confirm that outlier detection does not impair resultswhen applied to training data (Table 5.4). Significance was determined inbootstrapped statistics. Difference was calculated for 1000 re-samplings67Summary of resultsFigure 5.3. The upper figure A shows the performance of all tested algorithm versions fornon-inferiority. All methods reached the benchmark performance defined inthis paper, as the 95% CI of ∆kappa differences between IOAs of all humanand human/SDA annotations included zero. The lower figure demonstratesthe improvement reached when using 30 seconds minimum seizure duration.and if the 95% CI of this distribution included zero, there was no statisticaldifference between results. As the outlier detection parameters wereoptimized to maximize Cohen’s kappa between human experts and SDA,our primary measure in this analysis was kappa on concatenated recording.Outlier detection significantly improved the agreement between SDA andhuman experts. From the table, it can be seen that kappa is increasing andAUC decreasing. These results demonstrate the need for both measures inperformance assessment. The key difference in the analysis of AUC andkappa is that kappa accounts for segments with non consensus.The SDA generalized from the training data to the validation data, asthere was no significant difference in AUC between the data sets (Table5.5, column 1). AUC was our primary measure of generalizability, as itcombines the two measures sensitivity and specificity, and is widely usedas a performance measure in the field of neonatal seizure detection. Othermeasures (except for sensitivity) were also improved on the validation data.The decrease in sensitivity is offset by increase in specificity. Kappa washigher in the validation data as well, although kappas are more difficultto compare between data sets as kappa is affected by class prevalence.However, none of these improvements were statistically significant. As thecomparison for generalizability was calculated between two different datasets and bootstrap statistics could not be used, a Mann-Whitney U test68Table 5.4.

The algorithm of Temko and colleagues [87] is the mostthoroughly studied state-of-the-art neonatal SDA. Most of the parametersshowed a significant decrease in performance for the implementation ofthe Temko algorithm compared to our proposed algorithm.The SDA was slightly inferior to the human annotation within the fullvalidation data set (Table 5.6). Differences in Cohen’s kappa were calcu-lated between each expert and the SDA annotation. Results are shown forone human expert only, since for non-inferiority it is enough if any humanannotation is indistinguishable from the SDA annotation. Re-trainingwith additional data (n = 10) from the validation set, and testing withthe left-over validation data (n = 18), resulted in non-inferior results (95%CI spans zero). The improvement achieved with re-training underlinesthe importance of heterogeneity in the SVM training data. Additionaltraining data also improved all temporal and event based performancemeasures - AUC, sensitivity, specificity as well as SDR, FD/h and kappa onconcatenated recordings.Finally, the proposed SDA provided an annotation of seizure and non-seizure periods that was clinically relevant (Table 5.7). The accuracies ofmeasures evaluating treatment targeting and outcome prediction werebetween 87% and 93%. Additionally, the hourly seizure burden annotatedby the SDA followed the consensus annotation of seizure burden by thehuman experts (Figure 5.4).To conclude, the computational features implemented in this thesis repre-sented the key characteristics of neonatal EEG seizures, non-stationarityand periodicity. Although these measures performed well in single feature69Summary of resultsTable 5.5.

Improvements to seizure detection occur throughbetter feature design, outlier detection and increased data diversity. Thealgorithm performance generalized from the training data set to unseenvalidation data set. With additional diversity from 10 patients’ EEG datafrom the validation set, the algorithm was also indistinguishable fromthe human annotation when tested on the left over 18 patients. Finally,the SDA proved to be of clinical relevance in multiple measures of hourlyseizure burden.726. DiscussionThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded in recent years in manyindustries, including medicine. Especially in radiology there have beenmultiple studies on AI mimicking the physician interpreting medical im-ages [17, 45, 96]. AI could potentially help decrease the burden on health-care systems and improve medical outcomes by processing vast amounts ofdata, with an efficiency that human experts cannot achieve. In the NICU,there is a lack of neurophysiolgical expertise to annotate EEG recordingslasting up to several days. Clinical decision making could be supported byan automated SDA. In this thesis we have developed a neonatal SDA in-corporating features of non-stationary periodic characteristics of neonatalseizures, that outperforms our implementation of a state-of-the-art SVM-based detector ([87]). The algorithm was validated on a data set of longduration EEG recordings, using comprehensive measures for generalizabil-ity, non-inferiority to human annotation, and clinical relevance. The SDAgeneralized from the training to the validation data set, was non-inferior tothe human expert with added diversity of the training data and provided aclinically relevant annotation of the EEG. The original algorithm and thetraining data set have been published with open access, to facilitate furtherdevelopment and comparisons of neonatal seizure detection methods.The proposed SDA has taken influence from two well-known and thor-oughly studied SDAs, the Deburchgraeve SDA and the Temko SDA [22, 87].In addition to turning the heuristic algorithm of Deburchgraeve and col-leagues into features of time-varying spike correlations (SNLEO features),we developed methods to capture the non-stationary and periodic charac-teristics of neonatal EEG seizure by means of time–frequency correlations.From the Temko SDA we adapted the structure of an SDA, their pre-and post-processing step as well as the classifier approach. In our firstpublication, the SNLEO features provided insufficient performance, andneeded supporting features from the frequency domain [PI]. This is rea-sonable, as the SNLEO features only represent seizure characteristics inthe time domain. The non-stationary correlation features designed forthe proposed SDA showed superior discrimination between seizure and73Discussionnon-seizure classes, compared to more than 50 other EEG features [PII].The proposed SDA proved to be non-inferior to human annotation withincross-validation of the training data set (when using an epoch length of 16s) [PIV] and incorporating an outlier rejection step improved performanceon unseen validation data by adding robustness [PV]. Even though ouralgorithm outperformed our versions of both of the two earlier algorithms,a completely just comparison is not possible as these algorithms are notpublicly available.This is the first time for such a large data set of neonatal EEG withmultiple human annotations to be published. Open-access data is essen-tial for fair comparisons between existing seizure detection algorithmsand also facilitate the development of new algorithms. As performancemeasures are sensitive to seizure prevalence, etiology, and size of the data,it is important to have an open data set where these details are known.In addition to algorithm comparisons, our data set can also be used instudies of IOA and other EEG analyses. The openly accessible algorithmalso enables testing of our SDA on other data sets, and is to our knowledgethe first open access neonatal SDA ever published. The data sets used inthis study include various etiologies, long duration recordings with both4 channels (not openly accessible) and short duration recordings with a19-channel system. In addition to various etiologies and different numberof channels, another strength of the data sets is multiple annotations. Asannotations are known to be subjective, multiple annotators are a mustfor reliable algorithm development and performance assessment. In arecent study, it has been shown that training with consensus annotation ofmultiple experts is needed to train a CNN-based SDA that represents theunderlying characteristics of neonatal seizures [11]. The large number ofpatients is another strength of the training data set, as the inter-subjectvariability is known to be larger than intra-subject variability for annota-tions. Even though the algorithm was trained on short-duration recordings,the performance was consistent on long-duration recordings of the valida-tion data set. Inter-rater variability can also be estimated as both datasets have multiple reviewers.O’Shea and colleagues [61] reported results of our original algorithmtested on their data set and compared it to their CNN-based algorithm.The AUC for the CNN-based SDA was higher, but for a direct comparison,both algorithms should be trained on one data set and tested with another.Furthermore, the outlier rejection step was not included in the publishedversion of our algorithm, which would have improved the results on unseendata. In spite of the vast interest in deep learning in recent years, and theresults reported by O’Shea and colleagues favouring the CNN approach,there is room for ’bag of features’ -based SDAs as well. CNN is a cutting-edge technique, but building a high performance network from scratchrequires a lot of research. Architectural design is a rigorous process and74Discussiona time consuming task. On the other hand, so is the engineering of high-end features. However, SVM-based algorithms need less training data,and therefore the training phase is faster. Another key disadvantage ofCNNs is the low interpretability, whereas with classical machine learningalgorithms understanding the process and effect of different parametersis more straightforward. With an SVM, we can easily trace how eachdecision was made, helping to understand and troubleshoot possible issues.In the end, the customers who need convincing are the clinicians, andthey need to be able to understand the principles of the algorithm to alsotrust its performance. Even though deep learning is a powerful tool, itmight not always offer the best solution. As we found only incrementaldifferences between the hybrid, SVM, and CNN versions of the algorithm,we decided to proceed with our original approach using the SVM in theSDA development.In machine-learning methods, class imbalance can be a notable issuethat can be addressed with various class balancing approaches. However,with neonatal seizure detection the problem is less significant than withadult EEG, where the class imbalance is particularly higher. For neonatalSDAs the false positives are much more costly compared to false negatives,and therefore having more samples from the negative class is not alwaysan issue. The first-line treatment for seizures is ASDs, which are knownto be neurotoxic [8]. The clinical cost of false detection is therefore higher,particularly under the principle of primum no nocere, than missing a fewseizures. Furthermore, Isaev and colleagues [40] tested whether databalancing affects SVM-based neonatal SDA performance and found that itslightly reduces performance. Different data balancing approaches weretested in our work as well, and minor improvement, while not significant,was achieved [PI].There is no standardized way of assessing performance of neonatal SDAs.This is problematic, as published results are not directly comparable.The gold standard is always the human annotation, to which the SDAannotation is compared to. However, the inter-rater variability introducesuncertainty into this standard, while the IOA is never 100%. Measuressuch as AUC, seizure detection rate, or false detection rate do not takethis variability into account, and therefore it is difficult to interpret asingle AUC value without supporting analyses. This is a problem in manydeep-learning based approaches, where temporal measures like the AUCare the only reported performance measures [59, 61, 14, 40, 85]. As seenin our results, a decreasing AUC can be associated with a better detector(defined by IOA). AUC alone does not provide a benchmark measure forwhen the algorithm is "good enough". Since the human annotation isthe gold standard, algorithm performance is dependent on the numberof annotators and personal experience of the annotators, as well as onhow the non-consensus segments are being treated in the analysis. Most75Discussionstudies only have one or two human expert annotations available, whilein our training phase we had three. Many performance measures likeseizure detection rate are dependent on the selected detection threshold,and the methods of optimizing this threshold differ between studies. In aclinical decision support system, it would be useful for the user to be able toadjust the detection threshold, as the required sensitivity is user and taskdependent [53]. In addition, there is no standard way to present summaryresults statistics. AUC can be calculated per patient, then averaged, or byfirst averaging the sensitivity and specificity values over patients. Mean ormedian values might be presented. Optionally, the results can be evaluatedon concatenated recordings, in order to include patients without seizure toall performance measures. In the end, what is needed is a comprehensiveset of measures that could be compared from one study to another, offeringenough information for clinicians to show whether or not the algorithm isgood enough to be used in clinical practice. We claim that temporal andevent-based measures should be assessed on both concatenated recordingsand averaged over patients.There is no standardized way to evaluate how an SDA generalizes to un-seen data, and the selection of measures taken into account for the analysisof generalizability is debatable. In our study, we have chosen to use AUCfor this comparison, as it comprises both sensitivity and specificity and iswidely used to compare the performance of neonatal SDAs. The proposedSDA had consistent performance between training and validation datasets, showing no significant differences for most performance measures.In our assessment of non-inferiority we determine a non-inferior anno-tation when 95% CI of differences between the IOA of all human expertsand an algorithm/human annotation contains 0 for at least one of thereplaced human annotators. The selected 95% CI for non-inferiority mightbe too optimistic, and more studies are required in defining a benchmarkmetric. On the validation data set, retraining with additional data wasrequired to achieve an algorithm with non-inferior annotation. This can beexplained by differences in the data sets. The density of the electrodes wasdifferent, resulting in lower-amplitude seizures originating from sourcesfurther away from the electrodes. Additionally, some focal seizures mightbe missed or their morphology can be slightly changed when measuredfrom a distance compared to measuring locally. The validation data in-cludes normal EEG patterns like sleep wake cycling that are not presentin short duration recordings of the training data. Furthermore, the mostrepresented etiology stroke was not well presented in the training set, andit might cause seizures with a different kind of morphology. These findingssupport the need for a representative training data set, including variousetiologies, long duration recordings and preferably both dense and sparseelectrode setups.Eventually, the goodness of an SDA is defined in its usefulness as a76Discussiondecision support system. Even high performance values of the recent deeplearning algorithms ([6, 61, 85, 40, 14]) are for no good, if the algorithmdoesn’t improve clinical practice and patient outcomes. The SDA mustprovide an annotation of the EEG that is representative of the timingand amount of seizures. Measuring accuracy of an SDA in annotating theshort-term seizure burden on hourly basis is one possible way of assessingclinical efficacy. The short-time hourly seizure burden is used for targetingtreatment and can also be used to predict neurological outcome of theneonate [46]. In our validation study we have provided a variety of seizureburden evaluations to show that the SDA is giving a clinically relevantrepresentation of the EEG in terms of seizure burden [PV].Thorough validation studies and clinical trials are required for each andevery algorithm considered for patient care, followed by continuous devel-opment and constant evaluation of algorithm performance. Despite thelarge number of developed algorithms to date, only few of them have beenvalidated with a separate data set [53, 31, 51, 18, 76]. After validation, thefinal step in the process of implementing an SDA in clinical practice is aclinical trial. Before this step, a more thorough analysis of the strengthsand weaknesses of the algorithm, such as causes of false detections shouldbe performed. It might be of clinical interest to evaluate if the algorithm ismore accurately detecting seizures from a specific etiology or with whichetiologies it might be struggling. Also optimal detection thresholds as wellas visual representation of detections that would be most useful to theclinical workflow should be investigated. As noted in the final validationstudy, more heterogeneous training data improves classifier performance.Additional data from other centers and more etiologies could improveperformance. To achieve this, more open-access databases are needed.Finally, our algorithm has not been optimized for fast computation andthere may be room to improve the processing time. However, the valida-tion study showed that the proposed SDA has the promise of supportingclinical decision-making in the detection of neonatal seizures. With someof the additional evaluations mentioned above, the suggested method couldeventually be implemented in the NICU.In spite of the vast body of studies in automated algorithms such asneonatal SDAs, AI-based algorithms have not been widely adopted intopatient care due to issues and concerns in, for instance, data sharing, trans-parency of algorithms, patient privacy and safety, potential systematictreatment errors, and lack of user education for human-machine decisionmaking. The development of AI applications based on deep learning inparticular has been accelerated by the massive amounts of medical data,increased computing power, and space for data storage. There is neverthe-less debate whether or not the clinical use of nontransparent algorithmswould even be acceptable. The transparency issue is often seen as a prob-lem with these algorithms being "black boxes", but it also includes the lack77Discussionof open information on algorithm development from medical companies.For instance, a supervised-learning algorithm is only as good as the an-notated data used in the training, and information on the training setsused is rarely openly available. In this study, we have attempted to seta new direction in the field of neonatal seizure detection by publishingboth the data and the algorithm. Another open question with the use ofAI in clinical decision making is: Who takes the responsibility of possibletreatment errors? The potential for systematic errors is rightfully of majorconcern, compared to a random error made by a single medical doctor. Onthe other hand, the potential of AI to allocate resources more efficientlyand reduce costs is substantial. By keeping a critical mind and promotingeducation on machine learning for medical staff, AI can be used as thevaluable tool for high-performance medicine as it was intended to be.78References[1] EEG dataset, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1280684.https://zenodo.org/record/1280684#.Wxh3QkiFNaQ.[2] Matlab code:. https://github.com/ktapani/Neonatal_Seizure_Detection.[3] A Aarabi, R Grebe, and F Wallois.
