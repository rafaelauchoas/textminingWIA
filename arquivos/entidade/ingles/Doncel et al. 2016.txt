The point of view of both data publishers and data consumers is considered, identifying their rights and obligations, with special attention to those derived from the copyright and data pro-tection laws. The goal of this analysis is to identify the practices that help to make the publication and consumption of linked data resources legally compliant processes. An insight on broader regulations, best practices and common situations is given. 1. Introduction The World Wide Web was born 25 years ago and it has changed the way humans access information.The key of its success lay largely in the general adoption of common practices and their ability to create a network of linked documents or hypertext. These practices were formalised by the World Wide Web Con sortium (W3C) as “W3C Recommendations”, namely, public specifications discussed by a broad community. For example, the version 5 of HTML is a W3C Recommendation published in 2014. The W3C Consortium, still led by its founder Tim Berners-Lee, has published a new set of W3C Recommendations in the last few years towards the implementation of a “semantic web” of data. Much like the linkability of documents in the World Wide Web, the new web’s most distinct feature is the ability to reference chunks of data eventually published by others. This web of data (term opposed to the original web of documents) is intended to be accessed not only by humans, but also and mostly by machines.The ultimate practices recommended by the W3C to publish data on the web refer to it as “Linked Data”. Linked data is configuring a global data space of high quality data, strongly interconnected and with peculiar features that make it different from a database from the legal point of view. For example, machines understand particularly well the in formation offered as linked data, because data models are typically specified by computer ontologies which enable au tomated reasoning. Linked data favours connecting distributed pieces of information, relating apparently disparate datasets. Linked data uses crowdsourced vocabularies, where no au thority can impose the use of a specific variant. Linked data can be ephemeral, and it is hard to prove that some data was online at a precise time. In sum, a collection of linked data is * Corresponding author.

Linked data 2.1. Description of linked data The definition of linked data is often given as t he result of adopt ing a set of best practices for publishing and connecting data on the Web.16 T h e se practices c an be s u m m a r i s ed i n: structured (i) URIs17 a re u s ed as identifiers of t he r e s o u r c e s.

J. on Semantic Web a nd Information Systems, vol. 5(3), pp. 1–22. 17 A URIs is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the Internet (like mailto:john@example.com or http://example.com). The specification is defined in “RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Iden tifier (URI): Generic Syntax”. (ii) URIs resolve; namely, w h en typed in a web browser they return meaningful information about t he resource. Tech nically t h is is d o ne by establishing a HTTP c o n n e c t i o n; HTTP r e q u e s ts c an specify in their h e a d e rs w h e t h er in formation is to be c o n s u m ed by a h u m an (expecting t h en a well laid o ut HTML w e b p a ge as t he r e s p o n s e) or by a m a c h i ne (expecting t h en d a ta in a m a c h i ne r e a d a b le format like RDF or JSON). (iii) Local resources (data published in one’s internet domain) are connected to external resources (published by o t h e rs in another domain); m u ch like web pages have hyperlinks to o t h er e x t e r n al w eb p a g e s. (iv) T he u n it of information is t he RDF s t a t e m e n t, namely, a triple m a de of a subject, a property a nd an object. T he subject a nd t he property are also resources (URIs), while t he object c an be either a r e s o u r ce or s i m p le d a ta (e.g. a n u m b e r, a text string). This fourth r e c o m m e n d a t i on is s o m e t i m es r e l a x e d, a nd o t h er f o r ms l i ke JSON (or JSON-LD18) a re a c c e p t e d. T he a t o m ic u n it of i n f o r m a t i on in linked d a t a, t he RDF triple, c an e x p r e ss t h i n gs like “Alice is 6 feet tall”, provided t h at Alice is a r e s o u r ce identified by a URI (for e x a m p le http://example.com/Alice), t he h e i g ht is also a p r o p e r ty i d e n tified by a URI (for e x a m p le h t t p : / / e x a m p l e . c o m / h a s H e i g h t) a nd 6 is a c o n s t a nt (technically a “literal”). URIs c an be s h o r t e n ed by u s i ng n a m e s p a c es (e.g. “http://example.com/” c an be r e d u c ed to “ex:”), a nd m a ke easier t he e x p r e s s i on of t he triple: <ex:Alice, ex:hasHeight, “6”> Further RDF triples c an be s t a t ed about t he resource ‘Alice’ (like her friends, id or bank account n u m b e r ), creating a m e a n ingful u n it of i n f o r m a t i o n. Bigger collections of triples (for e x a m p le information a b o ut t he professors in a certain Uni versity) a re k n o wn as datasets. D a t a s e ts a re usually accessible per resource (querying Alice’s URI), as a d a ta file (an RDF d u mp with t he whole set of professors) or through specific access pro tocols (like SPARQL19). Some resources and properties are recurrently used by linked d a ta a d o p t e r s. For e x a m p l e, t he URI “foaf:knows” is u s ed to e x p r e ss f r i e n d s h ip r e l a t i o n s h i p s. T h is p r o p e r ty is formally defined as “A person known by this person (indicating some level the parties)”.20 T h e se well-of reciprocated k n o wn p r o p e r t i es a nd r e s o u r c es a re u s u a l ly p u b l i s h ed in collections covering a certain d o m a i n. They a re referred to as if i n f o r m a t i on a b o ut t h em is s i m p le (e.g. giving vocabularies computer h u m an r e a d a b le d e f i n i t i o ns for e a ch t e r m) or as interaction between 18 JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format based on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) a structured format similar in inten tion to XML. 19 SPARQL is an RDF query language specified by W3C at https:// www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/. 20 The definition is specified at http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/. ontologies21 if a c o m p l ex m o d el is specified. For e x a m p l e, t he p r o p e r ty “ex:hasHeight” u s ed in t he t r i p le a b o ve m i g ht be further described in a c o m p u t er ontology by declaring t he unit of m e a s u r e m e nt (feet or centimetres) or by specifying t h at t he p r o p e r ty is functional (namely, at m o st o ne value c an be given for o ne individual). C o m p u t er p r o g r a ms c an p r o c e ss t h is i n f o r m a t i on a nd r e a ct intelligently. S o me of t he triples within a d a t a s et relate resources in t he local d o m a in ( u n d er control by t he linked d a ta publisher) to r e s o u r c es in e x t e r n al d o m a i n s. For e x a m p l e, t he triple: <ex:Alice, foaf:knows, ex2:Bob> would express that Alice (resource identified within t he d o m a in ex) k n o ws Bob (identified by a URI in a n o t h er d o m a i n, like http://example2.com/Bob). Very often t he d e c l a r ed relation s h ip is an identity m a t c h: “They URI identifying Alice within the faculty refers to the same person identified by another URI within her club”. A c o l l e c t i on of t h e se t r i p l es u s ed to m a t ch r e s o u r c es is k n o wn as mapping or linkset.

Along t h is paper, we will consider linked d a ta resources to be in a wide s e n s e: (i) data models (ontologies, vocabularies, t h e sauri, etc.); (ii) linked data itself (RDF d u m p s, d a ta accessible via SPARQL e n d p o i n t s, RDF m a p p i n g s, etc.) a nd (iii) semantic ser vices and tools (ontology-based applications, s e m a n t ic services, etc.). 2.2.

An ontology is an abstract, simplified view of t he world of a system that has to be represented for some purpose, reached after consensus, and formalised with a machine readable language, typi cally OWL.Taxonomies and vocabularies are organised lists of terms, with sound textual definitions and a hierarchical structure. 22 Käfer, T. a nd Harth A.

Legal rights in relation to linked data Data h as b e en said to be legally i n e rt in itself, being “more ac curate to speak of the different kinds of rights that may arise ‘in relation to’ data, rather than simply of rights ‘in’ data”.24 The legal qualification of linked data resources (RDF datasets, ontologies, etc.) d e p e n ds on their n a t u r e: d a ta m ay consist in a literary work a nd a b i de copyright protection; m ay c o n t a in t he attributes of a d a t a b a se to attract d a t a b a se right; m ay have t he quality of confidentiality to enable enforcement from trade secrecy law or even convey personal information a nd recall data protection law.

Copyright is a legal e n t i t l e m e nt t h at r e n d e rs a form of p r o t e c t i on to t he a u t h o rs of “original”42 w o r k s. Following t he traditional civil analysis, only t h o se e n d e a v o u rs t h at a re intel lectual creations c an be qualified as works.43 T h is h as b e en m a i n t a i n ed s i n ce t he original Berne Convention in 1896.44 Many linked d a ta resources c an be a p p r o a c h ed as intellec t u al c r e a t i o ns t r a c t a b le as c o p y r i g h t a b le w o r k s. Copyright protects t he form in which a creation is expressed – e.g. a c o m p u t er p r o g r am is e x p r e s s ed t h r o u gh its s o u r ce c o d e. In order to a p p r e h e nd if linked d a ta r e s o u r c es benefit from copyright protection, a nd t h us a s s e rt t he c o r r e s p o n d e nt r i g h ts a nd o b ligations endorsed by its a u t h o r s, it is necessary to account t he legal n o r ms a nd its requisites on t he protectability of w o r k s. T he r e c o g n i t i on of o n t o l o g i es or o t h er l i n k ed d a ta r e s o u r c es as categories of literary a nd artistic work is a m a t t er of i n t e r p r e t a t i on of Art. 2 (1) of t he BC (as given in t he WIPO “Guide” to Copyright,45 §2.19) a nd s u ch a legal c h a r a c t e r i s a t i on is d e l e g a t ed to n a t i o n al legislature a nd j u d i c a t u r e. We contend t h at producing an ontology, a mapping or an RDF dataset m i g ht well e n t a il an intellectual c r e a t i on a t t r i b u t a b le to its a u t h o r. In particular, creating an ontology is n ot a l w a ys an a u t o m a t a b le task, a nd t h e re is usually a creator of original works w i th a creativity c o m p o n e nt r e m a r k a b le e n o u gh as to invoke copyright law. Conversely, typical content of data (even with little originality) does not fall u n d er t he copyright protection law and, consequently, is not constrained to legal barriers to be exposed as o p en d a t a. As an e x a m p le of ontology, t he Music Ontology is attributable to a p e r s o n, original a nd w i th a large s h a re of creativity, but t he Linked Movie Database is a collection of a u t o m a t i c a l ly h a r v e s t ed m e t a d a t a; t he f o r m er is an ontology probably protected by copyright, b ut t he latter is a d a t a s et n ot p r o t e c t ed by copyright. In practice, d a ta m o d e l s, s u ch as on tologies, vocabularies, thesauri, a nd RDF datasets m ay conform to t he requirements uttered above a nd h e n ce bestowed with copy right l aw p r o t e c t i o n. 42 The postulate of “originality” imputes an individual intellec tual creation originated from t he author, “reflecting the personality of the author” (Guide, §2.8), irrespective of t he concept of novelty/ innovation. 43 Art. 2 of t he BC defines and lists (non-exhaustively) t he types of literary and artistic works for which protection is endowed with: “[A]ll intellectual creations irrespective of whether they may be re garded as belonging to the literary domain, to the artistic domain or to both at the same time” [Guide03§2.15]. The term ‘literary’ h as to be understood in a very wide sense as “information-oriented produc tions expressed in letters, numbers or any other similar symbols, irrespective of whether they are legible for everyone or are coded (and thus available only to those who know and may use the code, or through the use of ap propriate equipment)”. Ficsor, M.: Guide to the Copyright and Related Rights Treaties Administered by WIPO a nd Glossary of Copyright and Related Rights Terms, Geneva WIPO (2003). 44 The Berne Convention has been internally amended many times, the last one in 1978. The WIPO Copyright Treaty amended the Berne Convention to include the copyright protection of computer pro grams as literary works (Art. 2 of the Berne Convention) in 1996. The TRIPS Agreement did not entail a formal a m e n d m e nt of BC, but supplemented it in 1994. 45 Guide to the Copyright and Related Rights Treaties Adminis tered by WIPO and Glossary of Copyright and Related Terms, WIPO Publication No. 891(E) (2003). Linked datasets c an be d e s i g n a t ed as “databases”, accord ing to t he Database Directive’s terminology – in Art. 1 (2) of t he Directive, a definition of a d a t a b a se is provided in a broad a nd technology-neutral way, as “a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means”. We a s s u me t h at given t he b r o a d n e ss of t he d a t a b a se definition in t he Di rective, t he t e rm d a t a s et falls u n d er this definition a nd will be u s ed interchangeably w i th t he t e rm d a t a b a s e. T he copyright protection of databases is refracted in t he BC, in Art. 5 of t he WCT, in t he TRIPS A g r e e m e nt (Art. 10.2) a nd in t he Art. 3 of t he D a t a b a se Directive, w h i ch provides t h at d a t a b a s e s, by r e a s on of t he selection or a r r a n g e m e nt of their contents, constitute t he author’s own intellectual original46 cre ation a nd a re protected by copyright. T h u s, individual facts a nd individual data (e.g. single RDF s t a t e m e n t s) c a n n ot be object of copyright protection. On t he contrary, RDF datasets are, in prin ciple, object of copyright protection. Nevertheless s o me RDF datasets a nd mappings h a ve b e en merely c r e a t ed very often by transforming data from already existing databases. For example, a d a t a s et w i th t he t e m p e r a t u r es a c q u i r ed from a w e a t h er station, or t he list with t he iTunes top-selling songs should not be categorised as literary or artistic w o r k s. Therefore m o st of t he RDF datasets a nd mappings are not eligible for copyright pro tection. Also, RDF statements t h at are inferred from t he a x i o ms of an ontology will n ot afford from copyright protection. On occasion, rights related to t he a u t h o rs of works m ay p o s sibly be b u n d l ed within t he linked d a ta resource. For e x a m p l e, t he creator of a collection of literary work codified as RDF would warrant rights on t he collection, but each of t he included works in t he collection w o u ld be still i n d e p e n d e n t ly p r o t e c t e d. Community-based databases (for e x a m p le Dbpedia, t he linked d a ta version of Wikipedia) a re well a n a l y s ed by Kierkegaard a nd Adrian,47 a nd typically imply t he a c c e p t a n ce of t he site maintainer’s conditions, h e n ce transferring or waiving t he ex ploitation rights; t h ey also benefit from copyright law. Protection of linked data resources under copyright 3.1.2. law T he a u t h or of a copyrightable work (creator of any work whose intellectual creative activity brings such works into existence (Guide §2.60)) is endowed with moral a nd exploitation rights. Moral rights allow t he a u t h or to t a ke c e r t a in a c t i o ns to p r e s e r ve t he per s o n al l i nk b e t w e en h i m s e lf or h e r s e lf a nd t he w o r k. I ts recognition is m a n d a t ed by BC (Art. 6 bis) a nd it comprises t he r i g h ts of: (i) attribution or paternity: t he right of t he a u t h or to “claim authorship” of t he work. On this basis, t he a u t h or h as t he right to be identified as t he a u t h or of a work, t he right of n ot being falsely a t t r i b u t ed as t he a u t h or of a n o t h er w o r k, as w e ll as t he r i g ht for t he a u t h or to r e m a in a n o n y m o u s; 46 Jurisprudence of t he ECJ h as been filling up t he criteria for t he assessment of originality in databases, as to the “imprint of the per sonality of the author” (ECJ case C-145/10) rendered in the composition, design, a nd tools elicited for t he database. 47 Kierkegaard, P. Adrian, A.: Wikitopia: Balancing intellectual prop erty rights within open source research databases, Computer Law & Security Review 26 (5) pp. 502–519 (2010). (ii) integrity or respect: t he right “to object to any distortion, mu tilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation”. T he a u t h or of a work m ay p u r s u it h is or h er exploitation rights48 (which allow t he rights owner to derive financial reward from t he u se of h is or h er w o r ks by others), comprising: (i) communication a nd making available to the public: right of t he owner of t he work to a u t h o r i se or prohibit any c o m m u n i c a t i on to t he public, irrespective of t he tool u s e d. Uploading a linked d a ta resource (an ontology, a dataset) i n to a w e b p a ge a nd o p e n i ng i ts a c c e ss w o u ld be an e x a m p le of t he exercise of t h is right; (ii) adaptation: right to a u t h o r i se or prohibit a d a p t a t i o n s, ar r a n g e m e n ts a nd o t h er a l t e r a t i o ns of t he w o r ks (Guide §12). It refers to a c o m b i n a t i on of t he pre-existing e l e m e n ts of t he w o r ks w i th s o me n ew o n e s, as a result of w h i ch n o r m a l ly a n ew work e m e r g e s. T he n ew work is protected as a derivative work, as provided for u n d er Art. 2 (3) of t he Convention. Converting a format, e x t e n d i ng an ontology, t r a n s f o r m i ng a c o m p u t er p r o g r am i n to a n o t h er c o m p u t er language, or from s o u r ce code i n to object code, configure e x a m p l es of t he right of adaption. In order to publish an a d a p t ed work, authorisation m u st be obtained b o th from t he o w n er of t he copyright in t he original work a nd from t he o w n er of copyright in t he a d a p t ed work; (iii) distribution: t he right to a u t h o r i se or prohibit a ny form of distribution of their w o r ks by sale or o t h e r w i s e. For example, this would be t he case of selling a compact disc w i th a p r o t e c t ed ontology; (iv) reproduction: t he right to a u t h o r i se or prohibit direct or indirectly, temporary or permanently copies of works.The definition of t h is right w as m a de in a t i me w h en no digital technologies existed, a nd reproducing content w as a costly p r o c e ss capable of g e n e r a t i ng profit: distribu t o rs h ad to b uy physical copies. N o w a d a y s, t h is right is a vestige w i th hardly a ny m e a n i ng for digital w o r k s.

Conf on the Interaction of Knowledge Rights, Data Protection a nd Communication (2013). (v) translation: exclusive right of making and of authorising the translation of their works throughout the term of pro tection of their rights in the original works. A common case in the semantic web would be translating the defi nitions in an ontology or the literals of an RDF dataset. Considered as rights in rem,51 the listed rights are enforce able against the whole world and entail, with infringement remedies, from temporary to permanent injunctions. Works are protected under copyright for a limited time frame and after the term of protection has expired a work falls into the public domain and can be freely used by anyone without requiring copyright compliance (in accordance with the ap plicable national rules on moral rights). However, the current terms of copyright protection are still quite long and not ap propriated to the digital environment: only few ontologies or linked datasets may have actual value after a few years. 3.1.3. Ontologies as computer programs Computer programs, whose source code is considered a sort of intellectual creation, receive special attention in copyright law. Ontologies might be understood as computer programs, es pecially if they contain rules for modelling a domain, if they are machine-enforceable, or have declarative constraints on their well-formed use. These features enable the matching between the concept of ontology with the computer program as defined by WIPO: “a set of instructions expressed in words, codes, schemes or in any other form, which is capable, when incorporated in a machine-readable medium, of causing a ‘computer’ – an elec tronic or similar device having information-processing capabilities – to perform or to achieve a particular task or result”.52 Computer pro grams are considered as a sub-category of “literary works”, whatever may be the mode or form of their expression, as de picted in the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 10.1), in the WCT (Art. 4) and in the Computer Programs Directive (Art. 1). 3.1.4. Database right The Database Directive entitles the author of a database to a sui generis right for non-creative works, regarding databases in respect of which there has been qualitatively and/or quanti tatively substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of its contents (Art. 7 (1)). Thus, to most RDF datasets and mappings in Europe, the Database Di rective applies. However, no directly equivalent right is found in the United States, Japan, China or Australia.53 The Data base Directive confers on qualifying databases the rights of extraction and re-utilisation: 51 Each right – copyright, database right, confidentiality and trade marks – is enforceable as an intellectual property right against the world (as a right in rem). See also Kemp, R., Hinton, P., Garland, P.: Legal rights in data. Computer Law & Security Review, Vol. 27(2), Apr. 2011, pp. 139–151 (2011). 52 The foregoing is taken from the definition included in the WIPO “Model Provisions on the Protection of Computer Software” adopted in 1978, 6–19. 53 Wilks, J., Christie, A. (2013) Rights in Data Handbook, Tech. rep., DLA Piper Technical Report. (i) extraction: the transfer of data to another medium as a whole or a substantial part thereof (e.g. downloading a dataset); (ii) re-utilisation: any form of making available to the public the database. For example, even if a person is autho rised to use a RDF dataset, this cannot be communicated to the public or to a third party. A database right is infringed if a person, without the owner’s consent, “extracts or re-utilises all or a substantial part of the contents of the database”, or carries out “repeated and sys tematic extraction or re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the contents of a database”. In our case, the extraction of indi vidual RDF triples is allowed, unless they convey substantial information (in terms of quantity or quality, or a combina tion of both). Different term-lengths are applied in the different Member States. According to the database duration, the first genera tion of a database right is of 15 years duration from the end of the year when the database was completed, as depicted in Art. 10. 3.1.5. Limitations and exceptions In order to maintain a balance54 between freedom of expres sion and information in the digital environment (incentive and access trade-offs), copyright-protected works, due to its non-absolute nature, may in some cases be used without the authorisation of the authors or rights holders and with or without compensation. A three-step test55 operates as the cri teria to constrain the kinds of copyright exceptions and limitations which each State enacts. An exception or limita tion to copyright is permissible only if: (i) it covers only special cases (copies made for scientific research and teaching purposes; uses in educational in stitutions or quotation); (ii) it does not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and; (iii) it does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate inter ests of the author. The precise definition of exceptions and limitations reside within the national legislature and thus vary substantially in number and scope (due to particular social, economic and his torical conditions); this differentiation originates legal fragmentation and uncertainty, and has compounded effects on the functioning of the digital single market, considering the development of cross-border activities, for instance, regard ing the question of fair compensation of right holders. In some instances, Member States are obliged to compensate right holders for the damage inflicted by a limitation or exception to their rights, whereas in other jurisdictions they are not obliged to do so, but may decide to provide for such compensation. 54 Acknowledged in the preamble of WCT or in recital 31 of the Copyright Directive. 55 See Art. 10 of WCT, Art. 9(2) of the BC, Art. 6(3) of the Com puter Programs Directive, Art. 6(3) of the Database Directive and Art 5(5) of the Copyright Directive. For our purposes, we mention some exceptions related to the communication rights, as we consider more allied to linked data: (a) teaching and non-commercial scientific research; (b) use by disabled persons; (c) news reporting; (d) criticism or review; and (e) caricature, parody or pastiche, as consigned in the Art. 5(5) of the Copyright Directive. 3.2. Data protection and linked data In this subsection, we investigate the current landscape of linked data with respect to the DP Directive. We should bear in mind here what we said above in regard to the enactment of the General Data Protection Reform package (2012–2016), which will substitute the still valid Directive 95/46/EC. It has been a long ongoing process until completing the new Regu lation draft.56 Rights, soft law (Privacy Impact Assessments) and more sanctions will be put in place, new concepts – such “genetic data”, “biometric data”, and “data concerning health” – are added, but the main guidelines remain.57 The wording of Draft Regulation defines personal data as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ‘data subject.’ ”58 Linked data is not necessarily published data; there is linked data not publicly available but still benefitting from its prin ciples (i.e. a strongly linked piece of information in RDF possibly accessible from a restricted domain). This linked data may contain personally identifiable information, in which case data protection laws apply. There is no evidence of enterprises cur rently using linked data at massive scale to internally store personal data, but this is a situation important enough as to consider. The main question of the 2015 Linked Data Aware ness Barometer (“Is Linked Data as mature enough to be used on a large scale in enterprises?”) is still pending.59 We advance with domain definitions, such as personal and sensitive informa tion, its corresponding obligations towards its protection, and potential risks scenarios fuelled with the use of linked data. 3.2.1. General aspects Personal data are defined (both in the Directive and in the Con vention 108) as information relating to an identified or identifiable 56 See Kuan Hon’s infographics on EU data protection legislative process at http://blog.kuan0.com/2015/01/data-protection-directive -vs-draft.html.

Reforming European Data Protection Law, Springer, Dor drecht (2015). 58 “[. . .] an identifiable person is one who can be identified, di rectly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identi fier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.” 59 See Linked Data Awareness Barometer 2015, http://www.meetup .com/Vienna-Semantic-Web-Meetup/messages/76529763/. Visited on April 2016. natural person.60 Both types of information (identified and iden tifiable information) are protected in the same manner. Identification requires elements which describe a person in such a way that he or she is distinguishable from all other persons and recognisable as an individual. Possible identifiers may be: “a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address”.61 A special category of personal data is sensitive data (as de picted in Art. 8 of the Directive, and Art. 6 of the Convention 108) and according to this definition, it is illegal to process per sonal data revealing special features: racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and data concerning health or sex life. A significant part of the Linked Open Data cloud can be now considered personal data, although sensitive data is less fre quent. User generated content and information from the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or LinkedIn) represents roughly the 50% of the Linked Open Data cloud62 - large parts of it constituting personal data records. Semantic Web enthu siasts publish their personal FOAF profiles as RDF, this data being publicly accessible. FOAF declare simple personal infor mation, like this excerpt extracted from Tim Berners-Lee profile63: rdf:type <http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card.rdf> owl:NamedIndividual, foaf:PersonalProfileDocument; dctitle “Tim Berners-Lee’s FOAF file”; cc:license <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/>; foaf:primaryTopic <https://www.w3.org/People/Berners -Lee/card#i>. <https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/card#i> rdf:type con:Male; foaf:mbox <mailto:timbl@w3.org>; foaf:phone <tel:+1-(617)-253-5702>; With respect to a personal data file, the DP Directive iden tifies the roles of data subject (the person about which data has been collected), data controllers and data processors. Data Con trollers (Art. 2 (d)) are those who, either alone or with others (joint controllership), control the contents and use of per sonal data (purpose and means of processing). They can be 60 A person is considered identifiable if a piece of information con tains elements of identification through which the person can be identified, directly or indirectly. As depicted in Recital 26 of the DP Directive, the standard is whether it is likely that reasonable means for identification (e.g. deanonymisation) will be available and ad ministered by the foreseeable users of the information (either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person, which includes third-party recipients). Recursively, if anyone can identify someone from the data, it is personal data. 61 European Commission’s press release announcing the proposed comprehensive reform of data protection rules, http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-46_en.htm?locale=en. 62 Schmachtenberg, M., Bizer, C, Paulheim, H., Adoption of the Linked Data Best Practices in Different Topical Domains.

Data processors (Art. 2 (e)) are a legally separate entity that pro cesses personal data on behalf of a controller. The definition of “processing of personal data” (contained in Art. 2 (c) of Convention 108; and Art. 2 (b) and Art. 3 (1) of the DP Directive,) covers “any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or al teration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combi nation, blocking, erasure or destruction”. In practice, this definition covers any possible usage of linked data. Personal data are processed under the liability of the data controller, who must implement all measures, both technical and organisational, to ensure that no harm is caused to the data subject by the processing. It is intricate to define the users of personal data in the complex environment of linked data, where many scenarios can be foreseen involving controllers and processors, alone or jointly, with different degrees of au tonomy and responsibility. This role qualification may render legal responsibility64 for complying with the respective obli gations under data protection law. (iii) to have a legitimate purpose: personal data must be col lected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes that are established by the data controllers, and not for other purposes which exceed the stated ones (according to the principle of purpose limitation, Art. 6 (b)). The compat ibility with these purposes can be assessed in relation to the specific and definable purpose: publishing and con suming linked data in a legally compliant way. However, if personal data no longer serve their initial purpose, but are to be kept in a personalised form for the purpose of historical, statistical or scientific use, the DP Directive and Convention 108 allows this possibility on condi tion that appropriate safeguards against misuse are applied (Art. 6 (1) (e); and Convention 108, Art. 5 (e)). (iv) to notify the supervisory authority (NDA) “before carrying out any wholly or partly automatic processing opera tion”. Such notification must contain specific details including, between others, “the purpose or purposes of the processing” (Art. 18 and 19 (1) (b) of DP Directive). (v) to respect data subject’s rights: the right of access to data, the right of rectification, erasure or blocking data when their processing does not comply with the provisions of the DP Directive (Art. 12), and the right to object to per sonal data processing (Art. 14). 3.2.2. Obligations about personal linked data Four major categories of obligations are required on those pro cessing personal linked data: The principles pursuant to the DP Directive when process ing personal data applied to linked data are subject of our analysis. (i) lawfully process the personal data (Art. 6 (1) (a) and (b) of the DP Directive; Art. 5 (a) and (b) of Convention 108). Those managing a personal linked dataset will have to demonstrate a legitimate legal basis for processing the personal data file. Storing and processing a personal linked data is possible if certain conditions hold. (ii) gather explicit consent65 from the data subjects. A valid consent shall fulfil these requirements: free, informed and concrete. Open consent, namely, unconditionally disclos ing personal information,66 cannot be sought within linked data. We may ask if the risks of hampering data protection are the same. If the risks are different, then perhaps there may exist grounds for a reconsideration of consent requirements and for a definition of open consent, which would stray further from the tradi tional model of specific informed consent (e.g. for research uses ‘in general’). Other conditions to store and process personal linked data exist. For example, if there is a vital interest of the data subject, if it is done in compliance with a legal ob ligation by the controller, if it is executed as a necessary step for the performance of a contract, and finally if there is a legitimate interest pursued by the controller. (i) the principle of proportionality imposes that personal data processing “must be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purposes for which they are collected and/or further pro cessed” (Art. 6 (c) DP Directive). Nevertheless, we may question how to respect this principle when reuse of per sonal data is allowed.We further contend how to respect the data minimisation principle with linked open data. (ii) the principles of purpose specification and use limitation67 (Art. 6 (1) (b) DP Directive; Art. 5 (b) Convention 108,) impose that the purposes for which personal data are col lected should be specified not later than at the time of data collection, and the subsequent use shall be limited to the fulfilment of those purposes. (iii) the principle of accountability (DP Directive, Art. 6 (2)) pos tulates the need of recording and making accessible the events related to the personal data. Semantic technolo gies particularly favour keeping a transparent account of the data transactions and chains of provenance are naturally represented as RDF graphs. (iv) the data quality principles, such as relevancy (Art. 6 (1) (c) DP Directive and accuracy of data (Art. 6 (1) (d) DP Direc tive). The limited retention of data (Art. 6 (1) (e) DP Directive; Art. 5 (e) of the Convention 108) warrants par ticular thought. It posits that data should be kept up to date when necessary, within a “time of conservation” (re-64 Art. 29 Working Party (2010), Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of “controller” and “processor”, WP 169, Brussels, 16 February 2010. 65 Concerning the validity of individual consent (Art. 2 (h) and Art. 7 of the Directive); see Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent, Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party. 66 Lunshof, J.E., Chadwick, R., Vorhaus D., and Church, G.

Technical report, Working Papers, ERCIS-European Re search Center for Information Systems (2014). 81 The European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS), registered a slight decrease in the number of service providers of fering access to “raw data” and an increase in the provision of “high quality processed data”. The latter m e a ns d a ta t h at is repre sented in a manner which supports data integration and analytics, i.e. data represented in manner which is interoperable, flexible and extensible, characteristics which conform as cornerstones of t he RDF data model. Table 2 – Legal instruments applied to typical linked data resources.

The notion of Meta-rule of law has been proposed to set the demo cratic conditions both of policies through digital or rights expression languages, and data (and meta-data) markets.83 3.4. Summary As analysed in this Section 3, in order to grant the lawful ness in using or publishing a linked data resource, the nature of the resource must be determined. As a rule-of-thumb, Table 2 depicts the applicable law in the most common cases, assum ing that the following assumptions hold: (i) linking data, i.e. publishing facts about other’s URIs, is the central activity of the whole linked data paradigm; (ii) individual RDF state ments have no IP protection; (iii) datasets and mappings are protected by database law (with the exception when triples are inferred); (iv) ontologies are regarded as copyright works and only occasionally as computer programs. In order to ease the lawful consumption of linked data, re sources should be accompanied by a description of their legal status (e.g. whether it has copyright, contains personal data, etc.), as postulated by Rodríguez et al.84 4. Conclusions 4.1. Review of legal aspects of linked data We have assessed that some cautions are necessary for con suming and publishing linked data in a lawful manner, and hence the existing legal framework has to be taken into account. As any specific legal characterisation of linked data re sources has not yet been construed, the assertions of this paper stemmed from a legal analysis of the European legal frame work, resorting to official sources and further discussion with experts on linked data. It was not intended as a thorough analy-82 Steyskal, S., Kirrane, S.

The potential threats of re-identification of individu als in anonymised datasets are boosted if these datasets are linked data – EU citizens, already concerned with security and privacy,85 may not realise the power of these new technical developments. It is our contention that rights and duties in relation to linked data resources configure a complex framework in a cross-border setting. Several, fragmented and differing legal instruments may be resorted among a mix of international, European and national rules: some resources can be pro tected by copyright and database laws, and their access may be limited by data protection, trade secrecy law, among others – each discipline conveying their own technical rules (in scope, enforcement and extent) within any single country. Although it was meant to harmonise and adapt copyright to the digital age, EU copyright rules are considered to be mal-adapted, outdated and fragmented towards the increase of cross-border information interconnectedness and exchange fa cilitated by the Internet, and utters a burden on online activities as to whether they are compliant with the law.86 Differences remain and the geographical scope of rights is limited to the territory of the Member State granting them. Any activity could be legal in one country but illegal in another due to the Member States discretion concerning exceptions and limi tations, causing cross-border friction and legal uncertainty. Moreover, these legal instruments (“national silos”) may be ap plicable in a concurrently and overlapping way to the same data source. Rights and duties also may apply to the same source of data (dataset) in a stratified way. For example, the dissemi nation of copyright-protected content on the Internet – e.g. uploading an existing ontology, requires, in principle, an au thorisation for each national territory in which the content is communicated to the public. Copyright law attempted to replicate the rules of the physi cal world into the digital world, by applying inadequate patterns to an entirely new context. In consequence, the traditional sta bility and the territoriality of copyright regime disrupted in the 85 In a recent Eurobarometer on Data Protection six out of ten re spondents said that they did not trust online businesses (63%), or phone companies and internet service providers (62%).

In the instance of the knowledge-based society, and facing the Digital Single Market vision, copyright rules need to be framed within a technology-neutral and future-proof way. 4.2. Outlook of future developments In a prospective thinking, further measures (legislative or non-legislative, including market-led solutions) need to be taken at EU level in the medium and long term ensuring an ad equate level of protection for right holders and in the data protection domain alike. The appointed limitations have been already acknowl edged by the European institutions, and the need for a reform was advanced in the Digital Agenda87 of the European Com mission, one of the seven pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and within the Intellectual Property Strategy88 in relation to the Digital Single Market.89 A “Public Consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules” took place in 2014 with important conclusions.90 Additionally, other market-led developments oc curred, like the work in the Linked Content Coalition.91 The required balance between exceptions and limitations in copyright could also be designed in the digital environ ment without any unequal treatment compared to those granted in the analogue world. Therefore, future compatibil ity of exceptions and limitations by taking due account of the effects of media convergence should also be considered. Ac cording to the European Parliament’s proposal,92 there is a call for the adoption of an open norm, introducing flexibility in the interpretation of exceptions and limitations in certain special cases that do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate inter ests of the author or right holder. As already stated, European data protection law has been under review for a long time.93 This review eventually re sulted in the recently approved General Data Protection Regulation (April 14th, 2016).94 The Regulation will enter into 87 Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010) 245 final/2. 88 A Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights, COM (2011) 287 final. 89 Communication on content in Digital Single Market, COM (2012) 789 final. 90 http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/ copyright-rules/index_en.htm (visited on April 2016). 91 http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/ (visited on April 2016). 92 Draft Report on the implementation of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (2014/2256(INI)), 14/01/2015. 93 Cf.

After nearly 4.000 amendments, the final draft of April 6th was approved by the EU Parliament on April 14th, 2014.

It repeals Directive 95/46/EC, provid ing a new background to the relationship between linked data and Data Protection. Hopefully, the GDPR will put an end to the “privacy patchwork” of the 28 EU Member States, as na tional Courts must apply its content without further ratification by national Parliaments. Yet, the construction of a Single Digital Market, protections enacted by DGDR, and provisions of the EU Agenda against terrorism and organised crime – espe cially in the aftermath of December 2015 and the recent attacks in Brussels – should be able to find a common ground in the immediate future. On March 11th, 2016, the Council agreed its negotiating position with EU Parliament on the proposal for a Directive on combatting terrorism.95 Very likely a proactive position (rather than merely reactive) will be held at the in stitutional level. It shall be harmonised with the basic positions and developments of GDPR. Four main innovations will be put in place: (i) the new Regu lation establishes a single, pan-European law for data protection; (ii) it sets a single regulatory framework for businesses as well, as companies – micro, small, medium-sized or corporations – will be treated differently but have to deal with one only Su pervisory Authority (SA); (iii) Data Protection SA will be able to fine companies who do not comply with EU rules with up maximum fines of €20 million or 4% of a business’s total world wide annual turnover; (iv) thus, service providers and other personal data processors on behalf of other businesses will be liable for data breaches, as they will have some direct obliga tions, such as taking adequate measures to protect personal data transfers. Therefore, along with the upcoming Directive on personal data processing in criminal matters, GDPR shapes a new general framework for the protection and exercise of rights. This foundational public character cannot be ignored. The text eventually approved consists of 99 articles, with 179 Recitals offering open statements and detailed explanations about the character, scope and nature of its implementation and intended effects. The new Regulation pays a special attention to the rights of access, rectification and erasure of personal information and it expands protections and rights to security issues.96 An adequate level of data protection rights should be kept for the processing and exchange of information in criminal matters, as stated even by the controversial (and confiden tial) “umbrella agreement” between US and EU on data 95 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/03/ 11-directive-on-combatting-terrorism/. 96 Recital 19 states that GDPR does not apply to “the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal of fences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public se curity and the free movement of such data”. It refers straight to the content of the next Directive on the protection of individuals, still pending, specifying that Member States may entrust compe tent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/ . . . with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for these purposes. transfers (October 9th, 2015).97 O t h er protective firewalls h a ve b e en built, after t he EU Court of Justice ruling against C o m mission’s US Safe Harbour Decision declaring s e c u re e n o u gh t he transfer of p e r s o n al d a ta from EU to USA.

We h ad a general directive that we replaced by regulation, but in t he police field we did not have anything like that. This is the first regulatory act which will provide police in all Member States with their common rules. In this frame work, the very important thing is that the general principles of proportionality, legitimacy and purpose-limitation are included in police work. That means that no form of mass surveillance is possible. The col lection of data is not possible. Retention for an unlimited or unclear period is not possible. Another important point is that we foresee the inclusion of data protection professionals in the police institutional setting: spe cifically, in police work [Our emphasis].” Debate on t he protection of individuals with regard to t he processing of personal data for t he purposes of crime prevention, Strasbourg, Wednesday, April 13th, 2016.
