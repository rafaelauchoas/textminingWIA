Halpern b,l a Computer Science Division, 387 Soda Hall, Universiry of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA h Computer Science Department, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 148.53, USA Abstract Belief change is a fundamental problem in AI: Agents constantly have to update their beliefs to accommodate new observations. In recent years, there has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining appropriate semanfic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in which to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge and plausibility: an agent believes C$ if he knows that C$ is more plausible than -4. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge, plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of Halpem and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then examine the problem of “minimal change”. This notion can be captured by using prior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated by “conditioning”. We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility measure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show how the two best-studied scenarios of fit into our framework. @ 1997 Elsevier Science belief change, belief revision and belief update, B.V. *Some of this work was done while both authors were at the IBM Almaden Research Center.

An alternative approach of $ is close worlds. Then we can interpret “the agent believes @’ as “the probability based on plausibility to 1” [ 501.

We briefly results here. Recall uncertainty in mind, we now describe plausibility measures that generalizes previous approaches, the relevant definitions [ 20,241, This including and review space is a tuple ( W, 3, Pr), where W is a set of worlds, F is subsets of W (that is, a set of subsets closed under union and that to which we assign probability), and Pr is a probability measure, in [0, I] satisfying the well-known to a number that a probability an algebra of measurable complementation is, a function mapping each set in 3 probability B are disjoint). A plausibility axioms in to numbers of a probability space is a direct generalization of set A”. If Pl( A) < Pl( B), [ 0, 11, maps them to elements as “the plausibility space. We simply replace the probability measure Pr by a plausibility measure Pl, which, rather than mapping sets in some arbitrary partially ordered in 3 then B is at least set. We read PI(A) as A. Formally, a plausibility space is a tuple S = (w 3, Pl), where W is a as plausible to some domain set of worlds, 7 is reflexive, D of plausibility values partially ordered by a relation 60 that is, it contains transitive, two for all d E D; we further special elements assume the ordering <u by taking dl <o d2 if dl <o d2 and dl # d2. We omit the subscript D from &, <D, TD and ID whenever that D is pointed: such that i D,D d <o TD < that Pl( a) = Tn and Pl(@) =Io. As usual, we define is an algebra of subsets of W, and Pl maps sets in F and anti-symmetric). We assume it is clear from context.

Some brief remarks on this definition: We have deliberately D of plausibility ordering play a significant subsets of interest and suppress mention of F, denoting the domain values from the tuple S, since for the purposes of this paper, only the is relevant. The algebra F also does not role in this paper. Unless we say otherwise, we assume _Y= contains all space as a pair induced by 6 on the subsets a plausibility suppressed in F (w,Pl). Clearly plausibility spaces generalize probability spaces.

The agent then compares the actual output We model this situation using the tools we presented in the previous sections. We start by describing two possible plausibility measures over worlds the resulting knowledge the agent’s knowledge using a Kripke structure. We then construct in this Kripke structures, and examine and belief. set-that is, the set of faulty components Knowledge. We model the agent’s knowledge about the circuit using the Kripke struc- ture Mzag = (Wdiag,ndiog,Kdiag). Each possible world w E Wdiog is composed of two parts: fauZt( w), thefailure in w, and vaZue( w), the value of all the lines in the circuit. We consider only worlds where the components in the circuit of Fig. 1, that are not in the failure sets perform as expected. For example, if and only if that 15 has value “high” if the AND gate Ai is not faulty, then we require that there is a both II and Z2 have the value “high”. Most accounts of diagnosis assume logical it must be the case that w is a possible world in M if and only if fauZt( w) and vuZue( w) are together consistent with A. The most straightforward let @diuR = GfauZ4( ci ) 7. . . ,fuulty( c,) , hi( 11) , . . . , hi( lk)} be the set of propositions, where i in a each fuuZty(ci) “high” state.

We define o, 5 value(w) the agent sets or observes. The agent knows which to be the tests he has and the results he observed. Therefore, we have (w, w’) E Kdia, if o, = owj. the agent observes hi(Zi ) A hi(Z2) A hi(Zs) A hi(Z7) A hi(Zs). The these are consistent with the correct behavior of the circuit, one of these worlds it might be in this case, since if is “high” regardless of values of those performed For example, agent then considers possible all worlds where the same observations hold. Since observations has an empty that the AND gate A2 is faulty. This would not affect the outputs A1 is non-faulty, A2’s output. failure set. However, other worlds are possible. For example, is “high”, and thus, 01’s output then its output imply Now suppose These observations “low”, then the correct values for 17 and Is should be “low” and “high”, respectively.) this case there are several possible that the agent observes hi(Zi) A +i(Z2) A hi( Zs) A hi(Z7) A -hi( Zs).

Thus, are faulty, but he may have beliefs there is more than one explanation for the observed that the circuit In general, is faulty. the agent can not know exactly which components on that score. Plausibility. To model the agent’s beliefs, we need to decide on the plausibility measure that only failure sets are relevant for determining the agent has at any world. We assume a plausibility measure over possible a world’s plausibility. Thus, we start by constructing 270 N.

In this measure Pl( Fi ) < Pl( F2) if that the likelihood of each component fi. This preference ordering the construction are independent of Proposition is preferred induces failing than minfEF,(lfl) < minfEFz(lfl). We can construct the same plausibility measure based on probabilistic failing arguments using is E.

Friedman, J.Y. Halpern/Artifcial Intelligence 95 (1997) 257-316 The same arguments that show that A2 gives us the AND rule also show that it gives us property K2 for beliefs. More precisely, we have the following result. Theorem 4. [f M sati$es QUAL, then for all worlds w in M, we have (a> (b) (cl Proof. In view of this result, we typically assume that QUAL holds whenever we want to reason about belief. The set fi(,,,i) consists of all worlds to which agent i assigns some degree of plausibil- ity in world w. We would not expect the agent to place a positive probability on worlds that he considers (even remotely) leads us to the following condition, to be impossible.

For all worlds w and w’ and all agents i, if (w, w’) E K; then Pi(W) = ‘/‘i( W’). It is easy to see that SDP implies that an agent knows his plausibility measure. In particular, as we shall see, with SDP we have that q5 +i (c, implies Ki(4 ti +). It is easy to verify that the structures described in the diagnosis example of Section 2.5 in the introduction, SDP is not appropriate satisfy CONS, REF, and SDP. As mentioned in all situations; several plausibility measures. To capture this, we need to generalize SDP The following example might help motivate at times we may want to allow the agent to consider possible the formal definition. the Rightfeet and the Leftfeet. The Rightfeet are known to usually there tell lie. Alice is a visitor to the island.

Thus, she considers One possible way of capturing and that he is a Leftfoot. island to usually is a Rightfoot this situation that Bob the worlds Alice to Bob’s tribe. Let WR (respectively WL) be into two sets, according that Alice considers possible where Bob is a Rightfoot (respectively considers possible the set of worlds Leftfoot). As the discussion of WR gives greater plausibility where Bob is lying; the formula T&i,,l(tell(#) where structures I in all the worlds is the formula telZ(q5) to worlds where Bob is telling above suggests, Alice’s plausibility measure at the worlds the truth than to worlds the opposite situation holds at worlds of WL.

For example, when we introduce (in Section 3.1)) these parameters might be the agent’s own actions in the future. Such a partition allows us such as “I do not know whether q5 is plausible or not, but I know to make statements that if I do a, then 4 is plausible”, where 4 is some statement about the future. If the agent does not know the value of these parameters, she will not necessarily know which conditionals that determine which conditional time into the picture are true at a given world (as was the case in the example above). it is possible 274 N.

For all worlds w and agents i, if w’ E fi(,,i, then ?i( w) = P~(w’).~ It is not hard to show that UNIF holds if and only if, for each agent i, we can partition the set of possible worlds plausibility space (Wc,Plc) w E C. Moreover, by the agent’s knowledge, then C G Ici( w). It easily follows if CONS also holds, in such a way that for each cell C in the partition, such that WC C C and Pi(w) = (WC, Plc) there is a for all worlds induced i.e., if C is a cell in the partition and w is some world C, then this partition the partition refines that SDP and CONS together imply UNIF.

In this section, we compare it to other notions considered in the literature. Recall that LB be the language where the only modal operators are BI , . . , B,. Let LKB be the language where we have Kl, . . . , K, and B1, . It is not hard to see (and will follow from our proofs below) even minimal restrict attention such as K2, we need to Kripke structures the AND rule to hold. Thus, for knowledge and plausibility , B, (but no +i operators). that to get belief to satisfy in this section, we that satisfy QUAL. ‘This condition is not the same as uniformity as defined in 1451; nther, it corresponds in the Lewis terminology to absoluteness. N.

Let M be that satisfy QUAL, and satisfying QUAL and CONS [ 34,37,44] is defined that belief in the literature in terms of a binary the properties of belief (in terms of plausibility) Work on belief and knowledge has focused on the modal systems S5, KD4.5, K45, and K with semantics based on Kripke structures as described in Section 2.1.

Can we define a which presumes relation Bi in terms of Ici and Pi such that (M, W) b Bi&, if and only if (M, U) k 4 in some structures, but not in general. for all u E E$( w)? We show that this is possible space. We say that A C W is a set of Let S = ( WPl) be a qualitative plausibility (where ;;i is the complement of A, i.e., W - A) that is more It is easy to verify that if such a set exists, then it must that A and A’ are both sets of most plausible worlds, We sets of this will show that we must have A = A’. To see that Pl (A n A’) > Pl (A n A’), that A n A’, A - A’ and A are pairwise disjoint.

That is, A is a minimal plausible be unique. To see this, suppose now show that Pl (A n A’) > Pl (A n A’).

For example, consider the space So = ( W Pl), where W = {wI 1 i 3 0} and PI is defined as follows: PI(A) = CQ if A contains an infinite number of worlds, and Pl( A) = ma_tiz,EA (i) otherwise. Suppose for otherwise Pl( A) = m. Thus, A must be that Pl( A) > PI(A). is infinite. Suppose wi E A. It is easy to see that A -- {Wi} finite. Thus, Pl(A - {w;}) > Pl(A - {wi}). Th is s h ows that there does not exist a set of most plausible worlds is infinite and A - {wi} ‘;i must be finite, in S. If there then we may not be able is no set of most plausible worlds, agent i’s beliefs. For example, consider to find a the structure M = r in Se above; truth values to primitive propositions pt , ~2, . . . in such a way that 7~( wi) (P,~) = Ict = W x W; and relation Bi that characterizes ( W, T, ICI, PI ), where W = {wi 1 i >, 0) is the set of worlds described assigns true if and only PI (wi> is the space SO described above.

If we measure the “distance” of a probability distribution Pr’ from Pr in terms of the cross-entropy of Pr’ relative to Pr, then it is well known that PrE is the distribution that minimizes the relative cross-entropy from Pr among all distributions Pr’ such that Pr’( E) = 1 1421.

Notice the plausibilities it possible 1) implies impossible Just as with probability, we assume that an agent has a prior plausibility measure on runs, that describes his prior assessment on the possible executions of the system. As the agent gains knowledge, he updates his prior by conditioning. More precisely, his previous assessment on the set of runs at each point in an possible considered at (r, m). This (posterior) updated assessment induces, via a projection to points, a plausibility measure on points. We can think of agent i’s posterior at time m as simply his prior conditioned on his knowledge at time m. in Fig. 2. This results of runs.

Let i and j be the minimal that Pli( (A U B) f’ Oi) > I, and Pl.;( (A U C) n 0.i) > I/. We claim indexes such that i = j. Assume, by way of contradiction, that i < j. Then, Pli( (A U C) n 0;) = 1; since Pies, (A U C) > Pl,s, (B), we get that and hence Pli (A n f2i) = Li. Moreover, Pl;( B n Q) = li. Using A3 in Si, we conclude that Pl,( (A U B) n fli) = -L;, which that Pli( (AU B) n L?i) > 1-i. Symmetric arguments show that contradicts our assumption i = j. By definition Pli( (A U B) n 0;) > Pli( C n a;) we also cannot have j < i. Thus, that Pli(A n 0,) > and Pl;((A U C) n Q) > Pli(B n 0,). Using A2 we conclude Pl;( (B UC) n 0,). for all j < i.

[y’, m] = [r, ml,. Thus, if [Y, rnli # For part (b), suppose that (Y’, m) E flc,,,,,jj. Since Z satisfies CONS, we have that (r, m). Moreover, since Z satisfies UNIF, we have that Pi( I’, m) = Pj( r, m). (r’, m) -i Thus, (Y’, m) E [r, m] i. We conclude that (r’,m+ For part (c), suppose (Y, m + 1) and Pf( r’, m + 1) = Pi( r, m + 1). Since Z satisfies perfect that ( r’, m) N; (r, m). Moreover, P;(r,m). We conclude desired. 1) No recall, we get since Z satisfies PERSIST, we get that Pi(r’, m) = as that (r’,m) E [r,m];. Thus, R( [r,m + I];) I],. This implies (I R( [r,m]i), that (r’,m+ that Q,,.,,,,i, C [r, ml;, as desired. 1) E [r,m+ Finally, we prove part (d) by induction on m. When m = 0, part that m > 0, (r’,O) E [r,O],, and (r’,m) holds. Suppose -i perfect recall, we have that (r’, m - 1) pi (r, m - 1). Using we get that (r’,m Using PERSIST, we conclude desired. that Pi(r’,m that Pi( r’, m) = P;(r, m). Thus, - 1) E [r,m - 11. This implies 0 (d) obviously (r,m). Since Z satisfies the induction hypothesis, - 1) = Pi(r,m - 1). (r’, m) E [r, m]i, as a prior over R’ Using both @ and @, we now construct that satisfies UNIF. For [ r]i abbreviate R( [r, 0] i).

Using part (b) Note of Lemma A.3 we get that if (r’,m) fl R;:,,,i, = 0, as desired. $2 [r”,m];, Thus, P/k,! is indeed well defined.

We claim that this family of priors satisfies UNIF. Notice that If r”” E .f$, ,) then, by definition, we get that ‘r’ E [r] ;. It easily guarantees r’ E L’,,,T,,;,.

For the opposite Since Y’ E R’(Kl(r’,m)), R;:,,, fl R’( K\( rl, nz) . The inclusion clusion, we must have there must also be some (s, m).

By part (c) of Lemma A.3, we get that that [Y’, 0] i = [r, 0] i. f (s,O) (s, 0) E [r, 0] ;. Now by part (d) of Lemma A.3, we get that (s, m) c [Y, m]i. Hence, Thus, Pii( s, m) = pipi( Yq m). Since Z satisfies UNIF and (s, m) E fic,f,,T,,i), it follows that that s E R;:,;,, [r’,O]i.

Given proof of Theorem 32. Finally, we need to ensure that 2’ satisfies A The proof of Theorem 32 shows that then so does 1’. Using parts (b) and (c) of Lemma A.2, it easily satisfies NORM, if1 follows that if Z satisfies QUAL or RANK, then so does Z’. If REF and UNIF are both in A (but SDP is not), then we need a further modification of the prior, (b”lyJy,;L prior of the agent resulting same arguments where Plr, in the same spirit of that in the proof of Theorem 32. Define Pr,, = (8) = _L and Plrli( A) = T for all A # 8. We now take the to show that the the It is straightforward ;) @ “r,i. i) = “il, system satisfies REF and the requirements of the theorem, using essentially to be $, for dealing with REF as in the proof of Theorem 32. the +i Finally, loss of generality suppose SDP E A but REF is not. Note that, since CONS and SDP imply UNIF, Z satisfies UNIF, so we can assume without that UNIF is also in A. To get Z’ to satisfy SDP, we further modify P’ so that it depends only on the agent, and not the run. Thus, we define py = @{Pr:.,, 1 r E R}, and define Pi,.,,!, = @,,,Fy’. in Clearly, with this prior, Z’ satisfies SDP. Again, we need to check prior does not affect the rest of our argument. Once more, the only difficulty comes case. Just as in the case of UNIF, we proceed by showing in dealing with that ?‘IR~(K;;(~I.~~)) = p~~,i,lR.‘(~l(l!.ll,)). The argument than that Again, for UNIF: We show that U,., Ryr,,i, rl R’(K’l(r’,~n)) that the inclusion suppose -j we must have (r,m) Y’ E ur, R&,;, (s, nz) _ Since s”’ E u,, R;:, iJ, there must also be some run r’ such that s E R;:, ,). Thus, (~7 m> E fl(r/,m,i). Since Z satisfies CONS, we have (s, LIZ) N; (Y’, m). It follows that (r’,m) -I (r, m).
