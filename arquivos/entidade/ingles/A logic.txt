IntroductionThis paper introduces an axiomatic model for bargaining analysis. We describe a bargainingsituation in propositional logic and represent bargainers’ preferences in total pre-orders.Based on the concept of minimal simultaneous concessions, we propose a solution ton-person bargaining problems and prove that the solution is uniquely characterizedby five logical axioms: Consistency, Comprehensiveness, Collective rationality, Disagreement,and Contraction independence. This framework provides a naive solution to multi-person,multi-issue bargaining problems in discrete domains. Although the solution is purelyqualitative, it can also be applied to continuous bargaining problems through a procedureof discretization, in which case the solution coincides with the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution.© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.As one of the most fundamental models in modern economic theory, the Nash bargaining solution [23] has been de-veloped into a highly sophisticated theory with extensive applications in economics, social science, political science andmanagement science [1,13,23,24,26,40,42]. Computer scientists, especially researchers in the area of artificial intelligence(AI), have found it useful in modeling interactions among distributed computer systems and autonomous software agentssince the early 90s [12,17,30,38]. Many applications have been developed for the design and evaluation of high-level inter-action protocols among autonomous agents for task assignment, resource allocation, conflict resolution, electronic tradingand web services [16,27,30,41,48].Traditionally, a bargaining situation is modeled as a numerical game, using the language of utility. In his seminal paper,Nash [23] defined a bargaining situation as a pair (S, d), where S ⊆ (cid:3)2 represents the set of utility pairs that can be derivedfrom possible agreements and d ∈ S is the utility pair that follows disagreement.1 A solution is a rule that associates toeach bargaining situation (S, d) a feasible utility pair of S. Nash proposed a set of axioms that he thought a solution shouldsatisfy and established the existence of a unique solution satisfying all the axioms [23]. Numerous extensions and alternativesolutions have been proposed in the past sixty years after this first axiomatic model of bargaining [42]. The subsequentwork has diverged in two different directions: the cooperative models and the non-cooperative models. The former, followingNash’s approach and thus also called axiomatic models, provide an axiomatic characterization of bargaining solutions [23,42].A bargaining problem is modelled as a one-shot game and solutions are characterized by a set of axioms, such as Paretooptimality, Symmetry, and so on. The non-cooperative models, also called strategic models, establish explicit constructions ofnegotiation procedures and identify the bargaining outcome as an equilibrium [1]. The attempt to establish the relationshipbetween the two models is known as the Nash program [1,24].The Nash bargaining model provides simple and mathematically elegant solutions to bargaining problems and facilitatesquantitative analysis of bargaining situations. However, in many real-world bargaining situations, the utility of a bargainerE-mail address: d.zhang@uws.edu.au.1 (cid:3)2 represents 2-dimensional real Euclidean space.0004-3702/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322cannot be measured using a numeric scale, therefore the solutions that are built on the Nash model become inapplicable.2Examples of such bargaining situations can be easily found in political/legal negotiations, household bargaining, labor dis-putes and so on. For instance, it is difficult to imagine an analysis of the Six-Party Talks on North Korea’s Nuclear Programthat is based on a numerical measure of each party’s utility gains or losses from the negotiations.3An alternative method of bargaining analysis, initially suggested by Shapley and Shubik, is modeling a bargaining situa-tion in terms of bargainers’ preference orderings over possible agreements [40, p. 91]. Formally, a bargaining situation canbe represented as a tuple ( A, D, (cid:2)1, (cid:2)2), where A is a set of possible agreements (described in physical terms), D is thedisagreement, and (cid:2)1 and (cid:2)2 are preference orderings over A ∪ {D}. The interpretation is that a (cid:2)i b if and only if player ieither prefers a to b or is indifferent [26, p. 9]. This allows us to assess a bargainer’s utility through pairwise comparisonsamong the possible agreements instead of quantitative measurement. Such a model of bargaining problems is called anordinal bargaining model. A bargaining solution is ordinal if it can be built on an ordinal bargaining model. We would liketo remark that a bargaining solution built on the Nash bargaining model can also be ordinal as long as it is invariant un-der any order-preserving transformations of utilities (ordinal invariance) because such a solution can be expressed in anordinal model [31]. Therefore the judgement of whether a solution is ordinal or cardinal is not by the use of numbers butits structure. In fact, most of the existing work on ordinal bargaining solutions in the literature was built on numericalmodels [3,25,35,37].The ordinal bargaining models are of interest because ordinal information is relatively easier to obtain than cardinal util-ities [36]. Asked if they prefer coffee or tea, anyone can provide a preference. However, if asked to value their preference incardinal scale, they would find it difficult [8]. Nevertheless, Shapley observed that there is no non-trivial ordinal bargainingsolution to two-player bargaining problems [39].4 The reason is, as pointed out by many researchers, that the informationabout bargainers’ attitudes towards risk, which in fact determines the negotiation power of a bargainer, is not describable byordinal preferences [26,31,40].5 With the Nash bargaining model, bargainers’ risk attitudes, combined with the preferenceson the possible agreements, are represented by utility scales, i.e., cardinal utility, through the non-linearity or curvature ofutility functions (for an intuitive example see [44]). However, such information is lost when the model is converted to anordinal model through an order-preserving transformation. Therefore the information about bargainers’ risk attitudes is lost.This suggests that additional components have to be introduced to the ordinal bargaining models to express bargainers’ riskattitudes.Rubinstein et al. introduced a variation of the ordinal bargaining model in which the preference ordering of each playeris extended to the space of lotteries over the possible agreements and the disagreement [33]. A player can express herattitudes towards risk through her preference on the lotteries. However, an ordinal preference on the lotteries is by nomeans easier to elicit than the utility scales on the possible agreements because the space of lotteries is also a continuum.More recently, O’Neill et al. introduced an ordinal bargaining solution based on the idea of gradual bargaining [25]. Instead ofmodeling a bargaining problem as a one-shot game, they look at bargaining as a family of bargaining games, parameterizedby time. The bargaining outcome can then be viewed as the limit of a step-by-step bargaining in which the agreementof the last negotiation becomes the disagreement point for the next. Players’ risk attitudes can then be observed throughthe variations of their utilities over time. However, there is no explicit representation of players’ attitudes towards risk.Zhang and Zhang proposed a purely qualitative model of bargaining based on bargainers’ ordinal preferences [44]. Similarto but different from Rubinstein et al.’s framework, the preference ordering of each player is defined on the player’s demanditems (instead of the lotteries of possible agreements). More precisely, the physical demands of each player are expressedby logical statements. A possible agreement is a logically consistent set of demands from each player. The risk attitudes ofa player are represented based on a relative ranking of the player’s demands: a risk-lover tends to insist on conflicting demandsmore firmly than a risk-averse player and therefore may rank these conflicting demands higher, and vice versa. Bargaining then isviewed as a procedure of conflict resolution over two sets of ranked demands (for two-player bargaining). A solution conceptwas proposed based on minimal changes but no axiomatic characterization was provided [44].This paper will develop an axiomatic model of bargaining based on the ordinal preference structure proposed in [44]. Wedescribe a bargaining situation in propositional logic and represent bargainers’ preferences in total pre-orders. Following thetradition of cooperative bargaining theory, we assume that any negotiation is conducted through an impartial arbitrator whohas complete information about the negotiation [22, Chapter 8].6 The agreement of a negotiation is the outcome of a se-quence of concessions simultaneously made by all players. We assume that whenever a player has to make a concession, shealways tries to make the concession as small as possible provided it is enough to break even. Based on the assumptions, wepropose a bargaining solution and establish that it is uniquely characterized by five plausible logical axioms. Our approach2 More precisely, most classical bargaining solutions built on the Nash bargaining model assume that individuals’ utility scales can be defined up toseparate increasing linear transformations. Such a utility measurement is often referred to as cardinal utility and a bargaining solution built on cardinalutilities is called a cardinal solution [40, p. 98].3 As Rubinstein comments “the language of utility allows the use of geometrical presentations and facilitates analysis; in contrast, the numerical presentation resultsin an unnatural statement of the axioms and the solutions” [34, p. 83].4 More precisely, the result says that a two-player bargaining problem has no single-valued solution satisfying ordinal invariance and strong individualrationality (see also [31, p. 70]).5 Although it was found, also by Shapley himself, that Shapley’s impossibility result does not apply to three-player bargaining problems, the problem ofrepresenting risk attitudes in ordinal structures still exists.6 A cooperative model of bargaining can also be used as a tool for off-line analysis of bargaining situations and for predicting bargaining outcomes.D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–13221309differs from most of the existing research on ordinal bargaining in that it is purely qualitative. However, we will demon-strate that the solution is applicable also to the continuous bargaining problems through a procedure of discretization, inwhich case the solution converges to the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will introduce a logic-based bargaining model to specifyarbitrary n-person bargaining games. Section 3 will introduce the axioms and construct the solution based on the extendedmodel. Section 4 contains our main result, the axiomatic characterization. In Section 5, we will use a typical game-theoreticbargaining problem to show that the proposed solution is also applicable to the continuous bargaining problem even thoughit is best suited to multi-issue, discrete bargaining problems. In Section 6, we conclude the work with a discussion of therelated work. Finally, to make the paper self-contained, we list the basic facts of the two most influential game-theoreticbargaining solutions, the Nash solution and the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution.2. The bargaining modelBargaining is a process through which a set of agents interact to reach an agreement. To model a bargaining situation, wedescribe the demands of each bargainer in logical statements. The demands of the bargainers may conflict, and thereforecollectively, they may be logically inconsistent. Successful bargaining will result in a mutually acceptable agreement thatcompromises the demands of the bargainers into logically consistent statements.To facilitate a logical model of bargaining, we assume a propositional language L. The language consists of a finiteset of propositional variables and the standard propositional connectives {¬, ∨, ∧, →}. We will apply the standard syntaxand semantics of propositional logic. Propositional sentences will be denoted by ϕ, ψ, . . . . As usual, the symbol (cid:9) denotesderivability, and the concept of logical consistency is defined as usual.Let (cid:3) be a binary relation on a non-empty set X . (cid:3) is a total pre-order, or complete transitive reflexive order, on X if itsatisfies the following properties:• Completeness or totality: For all ϕ, ψ ∈ X , ϕ (cid:3) ψ or ψ (cid:3) ϕ.• Reflexivity: For all ϕ ∈ X , ϕ (cid:3) ϕ.• Transitivity: For all ϕ, ψ, χ ∈ X , if ϕ (cid:3) ψ and ψ (cid:3) χ , then ϕ (cid:3) χ .2.1. Demands of a bargainerGiven a bargaining situation with n participants, assume that the final agreement is represented by a collection of logicalstatements in the language we specified above. Each participant in the bargaining requests that the final agreement containsa set of statements, which are referred to as the demands of the bargainer.7 For example, a buyer in a price negotiation mayhave the demands “the price of the product is no more than $10” and “the warranty is no fewer than three years”. In addition,we assume that each bargainer has a preference on the statements of her demands, indicating how eagerly she wants thestatements to be written in the final agreement. Formally, we can represent a bargainer’s demands and preferences in thefollowing structure:Definition 1. A demand set in L is a pair ( X, (cid:3)), where X is a finite, logically consistent set of sentences in L and (cid:3) isa total pre-order on X .As mentioned above, a demand set represents the statements an agent wants the agreement of a negotiation to stipulate.The ordering of the demand set represents how firmly the agent insists on her demands: the higher the firmer. In somesituations, such an ordering can be recorded by observing the sequence of demands the agent gives up during a course ofbargaining: the later it is dropped, the firmer. Note that the preference ordering of a player does not represent the payoff theplayer receives from the associated demands. For instance, suppose that two players bargain over the partition of a cake(Section 5). A player receives the highest payoff if she gets the whole cake. However, getting the whole cake should be theleast entrenched demand for a player unless she does not want to reach an agreement, because if both players insist onthe demand, no agreement could be reached. In addition, the preference ordering of a player is purely private information.A player can get great advantage if she knows other players’ preference orderings. However, how to take advantage of otherplayers’ information is a research topic of strategic models (or called non-cooperative models) of bargaining [1].We would like to remark that, in general, the demand set of a player is non-empty, which means that no player wouldparticipate in a negotiation for nothing. However, we will use the empty demand set (∅, (cid:3)) to indicate the situation inwhich a player discontinues a negotiation.Let ( X, (cid:3)) be a demand set. For any ϕ, ψ ∈ X , we write ϕ ≈ ψ to denote ϕ (cid:3) ψ and ψ (cid:3) ϕ. Obviously ≈ is an equiva-lence relation on X . Furthermore, ϕ (cid:12) ψ denotes ϕ (cid:3) ψ but ψ (cid:13)(cid:3) ϕ. Occasionally we also use (cid:4) and ≺ as the reverse orderof (cid:3) and (cid:12), respectively.7 We call these statements “demands” but they may be the player’s beliefs, goals, desired constraints or commonsense; whatever the player wants thefinal agreement to contain.1310D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322In the game-theoretical bargaining model, the concept of comprehensiveness plays an important role [32]. Formally, a set+, x ∈ S and y (cid:5) x implies y ∈ S [42]. In belief revision, we also have+ is called to be comprehensive if for all x, y ∈ (cid:3)nS ⊆ (cid:3)na similar concept, called cut [10].Definition 2. Given a demand set ( X, (cid:3)), a subset Y of X is comprehensive w.r.t. X if for any ϕ ∈ Y , ψ ∈ X and ψ (cid:3) ϕimplies ψ ∈ Y .In other words, if Y contains an item of X , it contains all the items of X that are at least as firmly kept as this item. Inanother view, a comprehensive subset is always an upper segment of the original set, i.e., a cut of X .2.2. Bargaining gameWith the representation of a single agent’s demands, we are now able to describe a bargaining situation with multipleagents. Consider a finite set N = {1, 2, . . . , n} of agents or players where n (cid:2) 2. We model an n-agent bargaining problem asfollows:Definition 3. An n-agent bargaining game is a tuple (( X1, (cid:3)1), . . . , ( Xn, (cid:3)n)), where ( Xi, (cid:3)i) is the demand set of agent iin L.We also write a bargaining game as (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N . The set of all n-agent bargaining games in language L is denoted by.Gn,LThere are two special kinds of bargaining situations. The first kind is that one of the agents discontinues an ongoingnegotiation by withdrawing all her demands. In such a case, we consider that the negotiation procedure terminates with adisagreement. The second special kind of bargaining situations is that there is no conflict among the demands from all theplayers in a negotiation, therefore no arbitration or compromises are actually needed. Formally, we introduce the followingconcepts:Definition 4. A bargaining game (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N is said to represent a disagreement situation if Xk = ∅ for some k. It is said tobe non-conflictive if it does not represent a disagreement situation andi∈N Xi is logically consistent.(cid:2)For a better understanding of the above bargaining model, let us consider a negotiation scenario.Example 1. Two political parties in the Parliament bargain over a government rescue plan in response to the 2008 finan-cial crisis. Each party may identify specific benefits from a different approach and therefore propose different rescue plans.Party A wants to put almost all the available funds into the major banks but leave a small portion for creating job opportuni-ties. Party B has a close relationship with the automobile industry and thus insists on investing in car manufacturers. Party Balso proposes that some money should be spent on helping people who hold significant mortgage debt.8 Both parties knowthat there is no need to give money to both sides of house mortgages: mortgagees and mortgagers. Also both parties real-ize that if putting money in both auto industry and financial institutions, the government will incur unprecedented heavydeficit. However, Party A holds a low deficit policy.9Suppose that we letcars: “rescue automobile industry”;banks: “rescue the major banks”;mortgagers: “help house mortgagers”;jobs: “create job opportunities”;deficit: “heavy government deficit”.Then Party A’s demands can be written as(cid:3)X A =banks, jobs, ¬deficit, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers), (cars ∧ banks) → deficit(cid:4)and Party B’s demands are(cid:3)X B =cars, mortgagers, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers), (cars ∧ banks) → deficit(cid:4)Now suppose that Party A’s preference on its demands is:8 For instance, there were some house owners whose property values became even lower than their mortgage debts after the financial crisis.9 The scenario was refined by taking one of the anonymous reviewers’ suggestions.D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–13221311(cars ∧ banks) → deficit ≈ A ¬deficit (cid:12) A ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers) (cid:12) A banks (cid:12) A jobsParty B’s preference is:¬(banks ∧ mortgagers) ≈B (cars ∧ banks) → deficit (cid:12)B cars (cid:12)B mortgagersTherefore, the bargaining problem can be modeled by the game (( X A, (cid:3) A), ( X B , (cid:3)B )). Obviously we cannot satisfy alldemands from both parties (i.e., write all the demands into the final agreement) because they are logically inconsistent. Theinconsistency can be identified as follows:• banks, mortgagers, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers) (cid:9) ⊥,• cars, banks, ¬deficit, (cars ∧ banks) → deficit (cid:9) ⊥.One may notice that the statements ‘¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)’ and ‘(cars ∧ banks) → deficit’ are more like constraints thandemands. Both of the parties request writing these statements into the final agreement because the statements also repre-sent the parties’ standpoints. For Party B, if Party A does not agree on ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers), she will not go on. However,dropping this statement can be an option of Party A if she has chance to keep other more crucial demands. Thereforea demand of a player can be a standpoint the player wants the agreement to support.2.3. SubgamesA bargaining situation changes with the progress of bargaining. The following concepts capture the relationship betweenthe bargaining situations before and after players make concessions.Definition 5. Given a bargaining game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N , a bargaining game Gby G(cid:16) (cid:17) G, if for all i ∈ N,(cid:16) = (( X(cid:16)i is a comprehensive subset of Xi ,1. X(cid:16)2. (cid:4)(cid:16)= (cid:4)i ∩( Xi).i× X(cid:16)iFurthermore, G(cid:16)is a proper subgame of G, denoted by G(cid:16) (cid:2) G, if X(cid:16)i⊂ Xi for all i ∈ N.(cid:16)i, (cid:3)(cid:16)i))i∈N is a subgame of G, denotedIntuitively, a subgame represents a contraction of the original problem: a few players make concessions by dropping somedemands. The first condition requires each agent to retain its most preferred segment of demands whenever a concession ismade. The second condition requires each agent to retain their preference ordering.We remark that, to be a proper subgame, each player has to make a concession, i.e., Xa subgame as the result of a concession made by all players simultaneously, i.e., a simultaneous concession. Note that Gand G(cid:16) = G (due to a bargaining game being a vector).(cid:16) (cid:13)(cid:2) G do not imply G(cid:16)i⊂ X . Therefore, we can view(cid:16) (cid:17) GDefinition 6. G(cid:16)is the maximal proper subgame of G, denoted by G(cid:16) (cid:2)max G, if1. G2. G(cid:16) (cid:2) G;(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:2) G implies G(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:17) G(cid:16).The concept of a maximal proper subgame in fact captures the idea of minimal simultaneous concessions: “if everyagent has to make a concession, what is the smallest step an agent can take?” The first condition requires every agent to makea concession, that is, the concession is done simultaneously by all agents. The second condition guarantees that there is noother simultaneous concession with fewer losses of demands. Note that the minimal loss or maximal gain we identify hereis not simply in quantity, but more importantly in quality. Each agent gives up only their least preferred demands.3. Bargaining solutionWe have presented an n-person bargaining model with logical representation of demands and ordinal representation ofpreferences. In this section, we propose a solution concept based on this bargaining model.3.1. Solution concept and the axiomsGenerally speaking, the outcome of bargaining is an agreement or contract that is accepted by all players. Therefore themajor concern of a player is which and how many demands of the player are included in the final agreement. Formally,given a bargaining game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N , a possible outcome of the game is a tuple (O 1, . . . , O n) such that O i ⊆ Xi forall i. The agreement with respect to the possible outcome can then be defined as(cid:2)i∈N O i .1312D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322Definition 7. A bargaining solution fgame. In other words, for any G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N ,i-th component of f (G).(cid:2)is a function that assigns to a bargaining game in Gn,La possible outcome of thef (G) = ( f 1(G), . . . , fn(G)), where f i(G) ⊆ Xi . We will write f i(G) as thei∈N f i(G) is called the agreement of the game, denoted by A(G).We now consider what properties a solution should have. Following the tradition of cooperative bargaining theory, wecall these properties axioms.We require first that a bargaining solution should resolve all possible conflicts in the demands. In other words, theagreement needs to be logically consistent.Axiom 1 (Consistency).(cid:2)i∈N f i(G) is consistent.The next axiom assumes that whenever an agent has to make a concession, she should only consider giving up thoseleast preferred demands (see Definition 2).Axiom 2 (Comprehensiveness). f i(G) is comprehensive for all i.The following two axioms specify two special situations of bargaining. The first axiom deals with the situation whenthere is no conflict among the players’ demands. In such a case we assume that all players mutually accept each others’demands. The concept of a non-conflict bargaining game is referred to Definition 4.Axiom 3 (Collective rationality). If G is non-conflictive, then f i(G) = Xi for all i.The second special case deals with the disagreement situations, that is, there is a k such that Xk = ∅ (see Definition 4).In such a case, no agreement is reached.Axiom 4 (Disagreement). If G represents a disagreement situation, then f i(G) = ∅ for all i.The final axiom requires that a bargaining solution should be independent of any minimal simultaneous concession ofthe bargaining game unless no concession is needed. Obviously the axiom is an analog to Nash’s Independence of IrrelevantAlternatives (IIA) (see Appendix A).10Axiom 5 (Contraction independence). If G(cid:16) (cid:2)max G, then f (G) = f (G(cid:16)) unless G is non-conflictive.(cid:16) (cid:2)max G represents that G(cid:16)Recall that Gis a minimal simulta-neous concession of G (see Definition 6). The axiom actually implies another assumption: “Whenever a bargaining situationrequires a compromise due to conflicting demands, every agent has to make a concession by dropping a number of demands.” Theaxiom says, if each agent gives up only a minimal number of the least preferred demands, the bargaining solution shouldnot be affected because all the highly preferred demands of all players remain in the subgame.is a maximal proper subgame of G, which means that G(cid:16)3.2. Solution constructionIn this subsection we seek a concrete bargaining solution that can be exactly characterized by the axioms we proposedin the previous section. Before we present the formal construction of our bargaining solution, let us describe the intuitionbehind the construction.A bargaining solution can be interpreted as an arbitration procedure; i.e., a rule an arbitrator uses to decide what out-come to select [31]. Suppose now that a negotiation is carried out through the following arbitration procedure. At thebeginning of the negotiation, all participants submit their demands to the arbitrator who is in charge of the negotiation. Ifthere is no conflict among the demands, the negotiation terminates and the agreement is simply the collection of all thedemands; otherwise, the negotiation moves to the next stage, in which each agent has two options: make a concessionby withdrawing a number of demands (an agent is not allowed to add new demands), or declare a breakdown, in whichcase the negotiation terminates with an empty agreement.11 The procedure continues until the remaining demands areconsistent.The following subsections will formalize the procedure.10 This axiom is also referred to as contraction independence [42].11 We could consider another possibility that the negotiation continues with one less agent. However, no matter whether an agreement is reached in thereduced game or not, the agreement should not be considered as the agreement of the original game because at least one player does not agree.D.

Demand hierarchiesGiven a demand set ( Xi, (cid:4)i) of player i where Xi (cid:13)= ∅, we can define an equivalence relation ≈ on Xi in terms of the}Lil=1 in short, be the partition of Xi induced by the equivalenceordering (cid:4)i (see Section 2.1).12 Let { X 1relation ≈.

In particular, X >0i= Xi .(cid:2)3.2.2. The simultaneous concession solutionNow we present the construction of our bargaining solution.Definition 8. A bargaining solution F on Gn,L(( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N ,is the simultaneous concession solution (SCS) if for any bargaining game G =(cid:5)F (G) =>μ1, . . . , X(X(∅, . . . , ∅),>μn),if μ < Lotherwisewhere L = mini∈N Li and μ = min{k:concessions of the game.(cid:2)ni=1 X >kiis consistent}. We call L the height of G and μ is the minimal rounds ofThe construction of the simultaneous solution actually simulates the arbitration procedure described in the beginningof Section 3.2. Given a bargaining game, if the game represents a disagreement situation (there is an agent who has anempty demand), then the height of the game is zero, i.e., L = 0. In this case, no agreement is reached (empty agreement).= Xi for all i. No agent has to make any concession. InIf the game is non-conflictive, then μ = 0. In this case, F i(G) = X >0the cases when the arbitration procedure has to run a few rounds, each agent makes a minimal concession in each round.Here a minimal concession means whenever a player has to make a concession, she always gives up all the least preferreddemands in her demand hierarchy.13 Based on the assumption, after μ rounds, all the remaining demands are consistent. Inthe case when one agent has nothing to give up (μ (cid:2) L), we assume that the agent will declare a breakdown. In all othercases, the negotiation will end up with all the remaining demands. Fig. 1 illustrates the construction of the solution. Thedashed rectangle contains the demands that constitute the solution.iExample 2. Based on the bargaining game described in Example 1, the demand hierarchies of these two parties can beillustrated by the following table (the higher the more preferred):12 Note that this equivalence relation has nothing to do with logical equivalence. Two logically equivalent statements can belong to difference equivalentclasses.13 Thinking in Experimental Economics, this gives us a way to observe a bargainer’s demand hierarchy.1314D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322Party A(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)banksjobsParty B(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)carsmortgagersIt is easy to see that L A = 4, L B = 3 and μ = 2. The simultaneous concession solution of the game is:F A(G) =F B (G) =(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cars ∧ banks) → deficit, ¬deficit, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)(cid:4)(cars ∧ banks) → deficit, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)Then, the outcome of the negotiation (the agreement) is:A(G) =(cid:3)(cid:4)(cars ∧ banks) → deficit, ¬deficit, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)which means that none of the proposed rescue plans were passed except that Party A’s low-deficit policy is confirmed.As mentioned in Section 1, the most difficulty establishing an ordinal bargaining theory is that the language of ordinalutility is less expressive than the language of cardinal utility. An ordinal bargaining theory has to offer a way to expressbargainers’ attitudes towards risk. The following example demonstrates how this can be done with our model.Example 3. Consider the bargaining game in Example 1 again. Suppose that Party A has an additional demand, namedcoffee, meaning requesting a cup of coffee. The demand hierarchy is reordered as follows (Party B’s demands and preferenceremain the same):Party A(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)banksjobscoffeeParty B(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)carsmortgagersIt is not hard to calculate that the simultaneous concession solution gives the following outcome:(cid:3)¬deficit, (cars ∧ banks) → deficit, ¬(banks ∧ mortgagers), banks(cid:4)Obviously, Party A gets benefit from the extra demand, which actually helps it delay one compulsory concession. Wecall such a demand a dummy demand.14 A dummy demand can be placed anywhere in the demand hierarchy to representa desired delay of concession.15 It is easy to see that the use of dummy demands mimics the non-linearity of cardinalpreferences.It is worth mentioning that delaying a compulsory concessions is risky. If Party B instead were more aggressive, asshown in the demand hierarchy below (nothing negotiable except mortgagers), the outcome of the bargaining would havebeen totally different.Party A(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)banksjobscoffeeParty B(cars ∧ banks) → deficit¬(banks ∧ mortgagers)carsmortgagers14 More precisely, a dummy demand is a demand that does not conflict with other demands. The use of the dummy demand was firstly proposed byZhang and Zhang [44].15 There are also many other ways to delay a compulsory concession, such as reclaiming an equivalent statement.D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–13221315The outcome of the above bargaining game is an empty set because L (cid:2) μ.In general, a player can express her attitudes towards risk via her schedule of concessions. A risk-averse player maychoose to give up the demands that more likely contradict other players’ demands in an earlier stage of a negotiation inorder to increase the possibility of reaching an agreement. Thus she may give these demands lower preference. In contrast,a risk-loving player could place less radical demands or a dummy demand at lower levels of her demand hierarchy toprotract a negotiation and gain more bargaining power.4. CharacterizationWe now establish that the axioms we presented in Section 3.1 exactly characterize the simultaneous concession solutiondefined in Section 3.2.2.4.1. The main theoremTheorem 1. A bargaining solution is the simultaneous concession solution F if and only if it satisfies the axioms: Consistency, Com-prehensiveness, Collective rationality, Disagreement, and Contraction independence.The proof of the theorem requires the following technical lemma.Lemma 1. Let G(cid:16)be the maximal proper subgame of G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N . Then G(cid:16) = (( X >1i, (cid:4)(cid:16)i))i∈N , where (cid:4)(cid:16)i= (cid:4)i ∩ ( X >1i× X >1i).Proof. Firstly, for all i ∈ N, Xi (cid:13)= ∅ because G has at least one proper subgame GObviously for each i ∈ N, X >1i , (cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:16)Secondly, let Gi . Let ϕ ∈ X(cid:16)(cid:16) = (( X(cid:16)(cid:16)Xi \ X 1i . Since Ghave ψ (cid:3)i ϕ. By the comprehensiveness of Xsubgame of G, which implies Xthat X(cid:16)(cid:16)ifor all i ∈ N, which implies that (( Xis a comprehensive subset of Xi . Therefore we have (( X >1i ))i∈N be any proper subgame of G, we prove that Gi(cid:16)(cid:16)is a subgame of G, we know that ϕ ∈ Xi . Now let us assume that ψ ∈ Xi . If ϕ ∈ X 1i , weis a proper. We have proven(cid:16)(cid:16)i , we yield that ψ ∈ X⊂ Xi , a contradiction. It turns out that ϕ /∈ X 1(cid:16)(cid:16)i . This means that Xi ⊆ Xi))i∈N . Note that X >1i))i∈N (cid:2) G., (cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)i . However, Gi . We yield that ϕ ∈ X >1. Thus Xi (cid:13)= X >1, (cid:4)(cid:16)i(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:17) (( X >1⊂ Xi , for all i., or X >1=i(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)iiiii ))i∈N (cid:17) (( X >1i, (cid:4)(cid:16)i))i∈N ., (cid:4)(cid:16)i))i∈N is the maximal proper subgame of G (obviouslyAccording to Definition 6, the above arguments imply that (( X >1(cid:16)(cid:16)i⊆ X >1ii , (cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:16)i(cid:16)one game can have at most one maximal proper subgame). (cid:3)Proof of Theorem 1. “⇒”. We prove that F satisfies all the axioms.otherwise, F (G) = ( XFirstly, it is easy to show that F satisfies Consistency. In fact, for any G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N , if μ (cid:2) L, F (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅);(cid:2)ni∈N F i(G) is consistent.i=1 XTo show F satisfies Comprehensiveness, for all i, if F i(G) = ∅, F i(G) is a comprehensive subset of Xi ; otherwise, wei . If ψ (cid:3) ϕ, we have l (cid:2) k.i where k > μ. Given any ψ ∈ Xi , let ψ ∈ Xl). By the definition of μ,is consistent. In both cases,. Let ϕ ∈ X k, . . . , X>μi>μi>μ1>μn(cid:2)assume that ϕ ∈ F i(G). Thus ϕ ∈ X>μTherefore ψ ∈ Xi, which implies ψ ∈ F i(G).To see that F satisfies Collective rationality, let G = (( X1, (cid:3)1), . . . , ( Xn, (cid:3)n)) be a non-conflictive bargaining game (seeDefinition 4). In such a situation, it is easy to know that L (cid:2) 1 and μ = 0. It then follows from the solution constructionthat for each i, F i(G) = X >0= Xi , as desired.Obviously F satisfies Disagreement because if a game represents a disagreement situation (see Definition 4), L = 0 butiμ (cid:2) 0, which implies μ (cid:13)< L.Finally we prove that F satisfies Contraction independence. Consider a bargaining game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N . In the casewhen L = 0, there exists a k such that Xk = ∅, which means that G has no proper subgame. Therefore F satisfies the axiomtrivially. We then can assume that L > 0. In the case that μ = 0, the game is non-conflictive becausei∈N Xi is consistent(cid:16)and Xi (cid:13)= ∅ for all i. This situation has been excluded by the axiom. We can now assume that μ > 0. Let Gi))i∈Nto represent the height and the minimal rounds of concessionsbe the maximal proper subgame of G. We write Land (cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16) = L − 1 and μ(cid:16) = μ − 1.i). Obviously, Lof GiTherefore, μ < L if and only if μ(cid:16) < L(cid:16)) = (∅, . . . , ∅). In the other case when μ < L, wehave F (G) = ( X) and F (Gand μ(cid:16)(cid:16)= X >1ii. In the case that μ (cid:2) L, F (G) = F (G(cid:16)) = ( X. According to Lemma 1, for each i, we have X). For each i ∈ N, we then have= (cid:3)i ∩ ( X(cid:16) = (( Xi, (cid:3)(cid:16), . . . , X, . . . , X× X(cid:2)(cid:16)i(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)>μ1>μn(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)1(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)nX>μi=(cid:6)k>μ= X\(cid:16)iXki= Xi \μ(cid:6)(cid:7)=XkiXi \ X 1iμ(cid:16)(cid:6)k=1(cid:16)kiX=k=1(cid:6)k>μ(cid:16)(cid:16)kiX= X(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)iμ(cid:6)(cid:8)\k=2XkiTherefore F (G) = F (G(cid:16)).(1)1316D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322(cid:2)“⇐”. Suppose that a bargaining solution f satisfies the axioms: Consistency, Comprehensiveness, Collective rationality, Dis-agreement, and Contraction independence. We show that for any bargaining game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N , f (G) = F (G) by inductionon μ.For the base case that μ = 0, we know thati∈N Xi is consistent. If there is a k such that Xk = ∅, then G representsa disagreement situation. By the axiom Disagreement, we have f (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅). On the other hand, for any disagreementgame, we have L = 0. Thus μ (cid:13)< L, which implies that F (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅) by the construction of F . Therefore,f (G) = F (G).If Xi (cid:13)= ∅ for all i, G is a non-conflictive game. By Collective rationality, we have f (G) = ( X1, . . . , Xn). Meanwhile, F (G) =( X >01 , . . . , X >0Now we assume that for any game Gn ) = ( X1, . . . , Xn). Therefore we also have f (G) = F (G).f (G(cid:16)). We consider a game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N withwhich μ = k + 1. If G represents a disagreement situation, then the height of the game L = 0. By Disagreement, we havef (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅). Since μ (cid:2) L, by the construction of F , we have F (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅). Therefore f (G) = F (G). Now weconsider the non-trivial case in which L > 0. Let Gsuch that μ(cid:16) = k,(cid:16)) = F (G(cid:16) = (( X(cid:16)(cid:16)i, (cid:3)(cid:16)i))i∈N , where(cid:16)1. Xi2. (cid:3)(cid:16)i= X >1i= (cid:3)i ∩ ( X, and(cid:16)i× X(cid:16)i).Since L > 0 with respect to game G, we have that Xactually the maximal proper subgame of G. It is easy to see that μ(cid:16) = k. By the inductive assumption, we haveis a proper subgame of G. By Lemma 1, G(cid:13)= Xi for all i. Thus G(cid:16)i(cid:16)(cid:16)is(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:7)fG(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:7)G== F(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)1X, . . . , X(cid:8)(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)nAccording to Contraction independence, we have(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)f (G) = f(cid:16)G=(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)1X, . . . , X(cid:16)>μ(cid:16)nSimilar to Eq.

Game-theoretic properties of the bargaining solutionAmong the axioms that characterize the simultaneous concession solution, Axioms 1, 3 and 4 are purely logical proper-ties. Axioms 2 and 5, although represented in logical form, are rooted in game theory. Axiom 2 is the logical counterpartof comprehensiveness, which is a fundamental assumption in cooperative bargaining theory [42]. Axiom 5 is an analogueof Nash’s Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (see Appendix A). One may wonder whether the simultaneous concessionsolution satisfies other game-theoretic properties, such as Pareto optimality, Individual rationality, and so on.It is worth mentioning that there is a subtle difference between the standard game-theoretic ordinal bargaining modeland our model. The preference orderings in the classical ordinal model are defined based on the set of possible outcomes,while in our model the preference orderings are based on the demand set of each player. To examine the game-theoreticproperties of the bargaining solutions in our model, we need to restate these properties in our language.Given a bargaining game G = (( X1, (cid:3)1), . . . , ( Xn, (cid:3)n)), we let Ω(G) = {(O 1, . . . , O n): O i ⊆ Xi for all i ∈ N}, i.e., the setof possible outcomes of G (see Section 3.1). A possible outcome (O 1, . . . , O n) is comprehensive if for each i, O i is a compre-hensive subset of Xi . It is consistent if(cid:2)i∈N O i is consistent.(cid:16) ∈ Ω(G), we writeFor any two possible outcomes O , O• O (cid:3) O• O (cid:3) O• O (cid:12) O(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:16)iff O i ⊇ O(cid:16)iff O (cid:3) Oiff O i ⊃ O(cid:16)i for all i;but O (cid:13)= O(cid:16)i for all i.(cid:16);Based on the above concepts, we are now able to discuss the game-theoretic properties of the simultaneous concessionsolution. Firstly, the solution trivially satisfies the following Individual rationality:f (G) (cid:3) (∅, . . . , ∅)This is not interesting because the property is satisfied by any bargaining solution (see Definition 7). However, the followingstrong version of the property is appealing, which says that as long as a negotiation does not end with disagreement, noneof the players receives empty gain.Proposition 1. Disagreement and Contract independence imply the following property• (Strong individual rationality) f (G) (cid:12) (∅, . . . , ∅) unless f (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅).D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–13221317Proof. We apply induction on the height of a game. For any G ∈ Gn,Lwhose height L = 0, the game represents a disagree-ment situation. Thus Disagreement implies f (G) = (∅, . . . , ∅). Assume that the proposition holds for any game in which theheight equals k. Now consider a game G whose height L = k + 1. Let Gbe the maximal proper subgame G. By Contract(cid:16)) (cid:12) (∅, . . . , ∅) unlessindependence, f (G) = f (Gf (G(cid:16)) = (∅, . . . , ∅). So does f (G) because f (G) = f (G(cid:16)). According to Lemma 1, the height of Gis k. By induction assumption, f (G(cid:16)). (cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:16)Next we consider Pareto optimality. Obviously it is not reasonable to require a bargaining solution to be maximal interms of set inclusion without requiring the outcome to be comprehensive and consistent. Even though we impose compre-hensiveness and consistency on any possible outcome, strong Pareto optimality is still not attainable because the domain ofproblems to which our model applies is discrete (so is non-convex, see [5]). However, we have the following variation ofweak Pareto optimality.Proposition 2. The simultaneous concession solution satisfies the following property• (Weak Pareto optimality) If f (G) (cid:13)= (∅, . . . , ∅), there is no comprehensive consistent outcome O ∈ Ω(G) such that O (cid:12) f (G).Proof. Given a bargaining game G = (( Xi, (cid:3)i))i∈N , by the construction of the simultaneous concession solution, if F (G) (cid:13)=(∅, . . . , ∅), then F (G) = ( X), where μ is the minimal rounds of concessions of the game (see Definition 8).Suppose that there were a comprehensive consistent outcome O = (O 1, . . . , O n) ∈ Ω(G) such that O (cid:12) F (G). For eachi ∈ N, we have F i(G) ⊂ O i ⊆ Xi , which implies that Xi∈N O i is consistent, so does(cid:2), which contradicts the definition of μ. (cid:3)⊆ O i (obviously μ > 0). Since>μ−1i, . . . , X>μ1>μn(cid:2)i∈N X>μ−1i5. Continuous domainWe have introduced a purely qualitative solution to the bargaining problems in discrete domains. In this section, wedemonstrate that our solution is also applicable to continuous domains via a procedure of discretization. More importantly,the process of discretization reveals the connection between the logic-based bargaining solution and the numerical bargain-ing solutions.To make the process easy to understand, let us consider a well-known bargaining scenario: bargaining over the partitionof a cake (see, for instance, [21]). Two players, A and B, bargain over the partition of a cake of size π (π > 0). The set ofpossible agreements is Φ = {(x A, xB ): 0 (cid:5) x A (cid:5) π and xB = π − x A}. For each xi ∈ [0, π ], U i(xi) is player i’s utility fromobtaining a share xi of the cake, where player i’s utility function U i : [0, π ] → (cid:3) is strictly increasing and continuous.Without loss of generality, we assume that the disagreement point is d = (U A(0), U B (0)). Let(u A, u B ): U A(x A) = u A and U B (xB ) = u B for some (x A, xB ) ∈ ΦΩ =(cid:3)(cid:4)Then (Ω, d) is the numerical game that represents the bargaining problem.To represent the bargaining situation in the logical model, we first have to discretize the problem. Let L A and L B be twonon-zero natural numbers, the granularity in which each player wants to discretize the problem. Let L = min{L A, L B }. Foreach i ∈ { A, B} and each l (1 (cid:5) l (cid:5) Li), let P i(l) represent the following proposition:(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10)xi (cid:2) U−1i1 − lLiU i(0) + lLiU i(π )(2)Informally, we can assume that the utility of a player represents her degree of satisfaction on the share of the cake shegains. Each player i ranks her satisfaction in Li levels from U i(0) to U i(π ). Note that L A is not necessarily equal to L B .P i(l) then represents the demand of player i that she requests a share, which can bring her a satisfaction at least to level l.For instance, P i(Li) represents the demand that player i wants the whole cake, which will bring her to the highest level ofsatisfaction.We assume that each player knows the rule of the game: the total shares the two players can request should not be more thanπ . This rule can be expressed by a set, R, of logical statements. The elements of R are in the form ¬(P A(k) ∧ P B (l)) ∈ R.¬(P A(k) ∧ P B (l)) ∈ R if and only ifU A(0) + k1 − kL AL AU B (0) + lL B1 − lL BU A(π )U B (π )+ U> π−1A−1B(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(3)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)ULet T represent the following commonsense: for each player, as long as a demand for a bigger share is satisfied, any demand fora smaller share is also satisfied. Formally, T contains the statements in the form P i(k) → P i(l), where P i(k) → P i(l) ∈ T if andonly if k (cid:2) l for all 1 (cid:5) k, l (cid:5) Li and i ∈ { A, B}. We write C = R ∪ T .Let G = (( X A, (cid:3) A), ( X B , (cid:3)B )) be the bargaining game, whereX A = C ∪X B = C ∪(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)P A(1), P A(2), . . . , P A(L A)(cid:4)P B (1), P B (2), . . . , P B (L B )1318D.

F (G) = (C ∪ {P A(L A − μ)}, C ∪ {P B (L B − μ)}).The condition μ (cid:2) L means that the bargaining goes to the situation in which one of the players is forced to give upeverything (the game knowledge and a share of the cake). Thus the game will end with disagreement. If this is not the case,an agreement will be reached, which should contain, among others, the statements P A(L A − μ) and P B (L B − μ). In otherwords, the partition of the cake, (x A, xB ), satisfies the following conditions:1 − μL A(cid:9)1 − μL BU A(π )(cid:10)μL AμL BU A(0) +U B (0) +x A (cid:2) UxB (cid:2) UU B (π )−1A−1B(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)Combining with the condition x A + xB (cid:5) π , we have:(cid:14)(cid:9)x A ∈U−1A(cid:14)(cid:9)xB ∈U−1BμL AμL BU A(0) +U B (0) +(cid:9)1 − μL A1 − μL B(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10)U A(π )(cid:10)(cid:10), π − U−1B(cid:9)U B (π ), π − U−1A(cid:9)μL BμL AU B (0) +U A(0) +(cid:9)1 − μL B(cid:9)1 − μL A(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:15)U B (π )(cid:10)(cid:15)U A(π )(5)(6)Note that instead of giving the actual value of the bargaining outcome, the solution specifies an interval as its estimationof the bargaining outcome. This is due to the process of discretization. Proposition 3 will show that with the refinement ofdiscretization, the estimation converges to a single point.For a better understanding of the discretization procedure, let us consider an instance of the problem (see also [44]).Assume that player A has a linear utility scale of its share, U A(x A) = x A , and player B has a utility scale that is proportionalB . Let us assume that π = 100 and L A = L B = 10. Then for each l (1 (cid:5) l (cid:5) 10), P A(l)to the square of his share, U B (xB ) = x2represents the statement “x A (cid:2) 10l” (i.e., U A(x A) (cid:2) (1 − l10l” (i.e.,L AU B (xB ) (cid:2) (1 − lU B (π )). The demand hierarchy of each player represents the player’s demands, the scheduleL Bof concessions at each round, and the player’s knowledge of the game rules (see Table 1). It is not hard to know thatμ = 7. Therefore the simultaneous concession solution gives an estimation of the bargaining outcome as: x A ∈ [30, 45.2]and xB ∈ [54.8, 70] (Table 2 demonstrates the bargaining procedure).U A(π )) and P B (l) represents “xB (cid:2) 10)U A(0) + lL A)U B (0) + lL B√16 Note that each player ranks the game rule and commonsense highest. The ranking of the other demands follows exactly the natural order of concessions,i.e., the demands that have to be dropped earlier are ranked lower.17 Note that P i (k) → P i (l) ∈ C if k (cid:2) l.D.

Surprisingly, with the refinement of the discretization, the predictionis no longer in favor of the Nash solution but is approaching the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution. For instance, when L A =L B = 20, the solution gives the range x A ∈ [35, 40.8] and xB ∈ [59.2, 65]. When L A = L B = 100, the solution ranges becomex A ∈ [38, 38.4] and xB ∈ [61.6, 62].

Conclusion and related workIn this paper we introduced a logic-based axiomatic model of bargaining for qualitative bargaining analysis. With themodel a bargaining situation is described by a set of propositional statements and bargainers’ preferences are represented bytotal pre-orders. We proposed a solution to n-person bargaining problems based on the assumption of minimal simultaneous1320D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–1322concessions. We proved that the solution can be characterized by five natural and intuitive logical axioms. We demonstratedthat the solution is applicable not only to bargaining problems in discrete domains but also problems in continuous domains.In the latter case the solution gives an approximation of the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution.The key to our approach is the way in which the bargainers’ attitudes towards risk are expressed. We describe bar-gainers’ physical demands in logical statements together with the ordinal representation of preferences. A player’s attitudetowards risk is reflected by the player’s preferences over conflicting demands. A risk-averse player tends to give lower pref-erences to conflicting demands in order to reduce the risk of breakdown, whereas a risk-loving player would rather givelower preference to the conflicting demands to protract a negotiation in order to gain more benefit. We have observedthat logical relations among bargainers’ demands play an important role in the bargaining model. It is the combination ofordinal preferences and logical consistency that provides a medium for the expression of bargainers’ risk postures. Such arepresentation is much more natural than the representation through non-linearity of utility functions.Our bargaining solution is built on ordinal preferences; therefore it is an ordinal solution. Most existing work on ordinalbargaining solutions comes with conditions. Shapley, Kibris, Safra and Samet showed the existence of ordinal solutions tothe problems with no less than three players [14,35,40]. Calvo and Peters showed that ordinal solutions exist if at least oneplayer is cardinal [3]. As mentioned in Section 1, Rubinstein et al.’s solution requires each player to provide a preferenceordering on the space of lotteries over the set of possible agreements [33]. O’Neill et al.’s solution gives an outcome whichis a limit of a family of bargaining solutions in continuous domains [25]. In contrast, the solution proposed in this paper isapplicable to any n-player bargaining problem with no constraints on the number or the type of players.We would like to remark that our framework provides a naive solution to multi-issue bargaining. The analysis of multi-issue bargaining can be extremely complicated. Multi-issue bargaining problems are mostly procedure-dependent, thusaxiomatic analysis becomes much harder. Almost all existing research on multi-issue bargaining is based on non-cooperativemodels, such as [6,7,11,43]. Axiomatic analysis requires aggregation of preferences on issues. The simplest and most com-monly used assumption is additivity of utility over issues [28]. With additivity, a multi-issue bargaining problem can bereduced to a single-issue problem, which is less interesting [29]. Unlike the existing work on multi-issue bargaining, wedescribe negotiation terms in logical statements. The relations between bargaining issues can be specified by logical con-nectives. With the benefit of the expressiveness of logical language, our solution has clear advantages in dealing withbargaining situations with complicated relations among bargaining issues and bargaining problems in which quantitativeanalysis are hard to apply. Such bargaining situations are common in legal bargaining, labor bargaining, political bargainingand family bargaining.As one of the frameworks for conflict resolution, this work has a close relationship with the axiomatic models of beliefrevision, belief merging and belief arbitration. In fact, the axioms Consistency and Collective rationality are fundamentalassumptions for all these operations [4,9,15,18]. The idea of simultaneous concessions is also applicable to belief merging.18Nevertheless, the differences between bargaining and belief merging are obvious. For merging, the information sources arepassive therefore we can optimize the outcome of merging. However, in a bargaining, bargainers take initiative. The outcomeof bargaining purely relies on bargainers’ strategies. For example, assume a bargaining situation (( X1, (cid:3)1), ( X2, (cid:3)2)) asfollows:• X1 = {p, q} and X2 = {p, ¬q};• p ≈1 q and p ≈2 ¬q.Then the bargaining ends with disagreement because no player is prepared to compromise. However, from the belief merg-ing point of view, it is reasonable to assume that the merging of these two information sources contains p (for instance,Axiom A7 in [18]). In addition, a bargaining model can also partially encode players’ strategic reasoning. Suppose thatplayer 1 is risk-averse who is willing to give up q in order to keep p, i.e., p (cid:12)1 q; while player 2 is a risk-lover whocreates a dummy demand p ∨ ¬p and adds it to her demand set in order to circumvent a compulsory concession, i.e.,p ≈2 ¬q (cid:12)2 p ∨ ¬p. The outcome of bargaining will then be ({p}, {p, ¬q}). Note that player 2 does not lose anything, whichshows another difference between bargaining and belief merging (see footnote 18).There have been a few other frameworks for negotiation or bargaining built upon, or in the spirit of, belief revisiontheory. Booth proposed a negotiation model based on multi-agent belief contraction (or social contraction) [2]. Zhang et al.introduced the idea of modeling negotiation as a process of mutual belief revision [45]. Meyer et al. discussed the logicalproperties of a negotiation model based on AGM theory [19,20]. However, none of these works provided an axiomatic modelof negotiation with characterization of players’ preference orderings.This work is part of an ongoing project on logical analysis of bargaining reasoning. In [46], we proposed a bargainingmodel in which negotiation items were represented in propositional logic but players’ preferences are represented numer-ically. Based on such a semi-quantitative model, we demonstrated that the Nash solution is still applicable if we applylotteries (randomization) to the set of possible agreements. In [47], we removed the requirement of randomization andconstructed a bargaining solution so that it can be characterized by a combination of logical axioms and game-theoretic18 For instance, if we impose the rule – “a merging operation must not give preference to any sources” – on a belief merging operator, then we can have anaxiom saying that “whenever two belief bases are logically inconsistent, none of them can be fully retained in the merging outcome” (Axiom A4 in [15]).D. Zhang / Artificial Intelligence 174 (2010) 1307–13221321axioms. In [44], we introduced a bargaining model in which bargaining items are described by logical statements andplayers’ preferences represented in pre-orders. Based on such a purely qualitative model, a logic-based bargaining solutionwas constructed. In this paper, we developed an axiomatic model for the solution, thereby laying down a foundation forthe logic-based cooperative theory of bargaining. Meanwhile, the logic-based axiomatic model sheds light on the study oflogical analysis on strategic bargaining reasoning.There are a number of challenging issues on bargaining reasoning that need to be addressed in strategic models (ornon-cooperative models) of bargaining.19 Firstly, the axiomatic model abstracts all the items that a player wants the finalagreement to contain as the demands of the player. However, as we have seen in Example 1, some of these demands mayrepresent the player’s beliefs, goals or desired constraints. Identifying the roles of these specific demands in the player’sstrategic reasoning requires a model of the player and a model of the bargaining procedure. Secondly, a cooperative theoryof bargaining assumes that the information about bargainers’ preferences is available for bargaining analysis. However, fromeach player’s point of view, such information is private and disclosure of the information would lose the players theirbargaining power. The investigations on the possibility of one player manipulating a bargaining game using the knowledgeof other players’ private information also rely on a strategic model of bargaining. Finally, an interesting research direction forthe future is to study the ways in which coalitions of players influence bargaining outcomes, especially for knowledge-basedcoalitions.AcknowledgementsThe author would like to thank the anonymous referees for their detailed, insightful and useful comments.

Two classical game-theoretic bargaining solutionsTo make the paper self-contained, we briefly review the basic facts of the two classical game-theoretic bargaining so-lutions: the Nash solution [23] and the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution [13]. For more details on these bargaining solutions, thereader is referred to [42].In game theory, an n-player bargaining game is defined as a pair (S, d), where S ⊆ (cid:3)n represents the feasible set thatcan be derived from possible agreements and d ∈ S stands for the disagreement point. It is assumed that S is convexis a function that assigns to each bargaining game (S, d) a unique point of S, i.e.,and compact. A bargaining solution ff (S, d) ∈ S. A bargaining solution N is the Nash solution if for any bargaining game (S, d), N(S, d) is the maximizer of theproduct1(cid:3)i(cid:3)n(xi − di) over S.20(cid:16)Nash showed that a bargaining solution f = N if and only if it satisfies the following axioms [23]:• Pareto optimality: There is no y ∈ S such that y (cid:2) f (S, d).• Symmetry: If (S, d) is a symmetric game, then f i(S, d) = f j(S, d) for all i, j.• Scale Invariance: For any positive affine transformation τ = (τ1, . . . , τn), τ ( f (S, d)) = f (τ (S), τ (d)).• Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives: If S(cid:16) ⊆ S and f (S, d) ∈ S(cid:16), d) = f (S, d)., then f (S(cid:16)A bargaining solution K S is the Kalai–Smorodinsky solution (KS-solution) if for any bargaining game (S, d), KS(S, d) is themaximal point of S on the segment connecting d to a(S, d), where ai(S, d) = max{xi: x ∈ S & x (cid:6) d} for all i.Kalai and Smorodinsky showed that a solution f = KS for 2-person bargaining games if and only if it satisfies Paretooptimality, Symmetry, Scale Invariance as well as the following Restricted Monotonicity [13]:• Restricted Monotonicity: If S(cid:16) ⊆ S and a(S(cid:16), d) = a(S, d), then f (S, d) (cid:6) f (S(cid:16), d).In spite of the large number of other solutions that have been proposed in the literature, these two solutions are mostinfluential in game theory (see [42] for a comprehensive survey).References[1] Ken Binmore, Martin J.
