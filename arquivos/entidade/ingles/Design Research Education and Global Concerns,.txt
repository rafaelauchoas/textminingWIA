Design educa-tion has a critical role to play in this transformation, as design is a materially engaged, world-building activity. Design is complicit in the problems we are facing, and informs and shapes how people live. In this article, I seed ideas about design research education for global challenges. I speak to the merits of post-disciplinary and hybrid strategies, and look to science for clues about how to respond to twenty-first-century challenges through design. I posit sustainability brokering as a new pathway for design, and anticipating al-ternative futures as a critical step in developing transformative innovation. I then propose participatory research through design as a foundational meth-odology; describe four pillars of practice to scaffold sophisticated research at undergraduate and master’s level; and lay out a work plan for building research capacity in a doctoral school. Through this process, I articulate core skills that design researchers will likely require if they are to contribute to global challenges constructively. My aim is to seed fruitful regenerative dis-cussion with these propositions.Copyright © 2020, Tongji University and Tongji University Press. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

It requires culture change, in society broadly, but also in design education, as design shapes our world. Humans — impactful species that we are — must become more mindful of how intertwined we are with nature, and with each other across the globe, and the broad-reaching impact of our situated (material, social, cultural, political, and ecological) practices. We need to make room for more diverse stories — a plurality of experiences and perspectives — and start choosing vibrant, regenerative futures that consider diverse, more-than-human con-cerns.2 Design education is necessarily a part of this transformation. Design and designers have contributed in profound ways to the problems we face, and continue to shape our world. For design to contribute constructively, design education must be continually renewed. Rather than “teaching skills related to processes and working methods of an age that has ended,”3 we need to teach for the inherent instability of the circumstances at hand. We need to equip designers to respond not only to urgent crises such as COVID-19, climate change, ecosystem collapse, social and environmental injustices, war, mass migration, poverty, food scarcity, and more; but also to as-yet- unknown possibilities. This is not a new story. For decades, Tomás Maldonado, Victor Papanek, Buckminster Fuller, Tony Fry, Ezio Manzini, Ann Light and her colleagues, Eli Blevis, Arturo Escobar, and more have been telling this story.4 And yet, it still urgently requires our attentiveness and care.In this article, I focus on design research education for global challenges. I make a series of propositions: taking a post-disciplinary approach, using hybrid strategies, and looking to science and creativity for clues about how design research education might become fit for twenty-first-century chal-lenges. I posit sustainability brokering — a proposition of resilience and sustainability studies to transform innovation for sustainability5 — as a new pathway for design. From this vantage point, I outline the value of anticipa-tion if we want to develop radically different ways of living — more sustain-able, nourishing, and regenerative. I then lay out the practices and principles that guide my design research pedagogy. I describe a participatory, applied action-reflection approach to research-through-design plus four pillars of practice that I find essential for designers to contribute to transformational innovation. These can scaffold sophisticated research at the undergraduate and master’s level. I then describe a work plan for building research capacity in an art and design doctoral school. This process results in a list of core skills that (I believe) design researchers require if they are to contribute to global challenges constructively. The ideas I present are not new. However, I find that they are not always successfully disseminated or assimilated into practice, and when intro-duced to fledgling design researchers, these approaches often prove game-changers. Further, my understanding of their value has become more pointed during the COVID-19 pandemic (unfolding as I write), as design students Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns1726 John Dewey, Art as Experience (New York: Penguin Group, 2005); John Dewey, “De-mocracy in Education,” The Elementary School Teacher 4, no. 4 (1903): 193–204, available at https://www.journals.uchi-cago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/453309; John Dewey, The Public and Its Problems: An Essay in Political Inquiry (New York: Holt, 1927).7 Jane Addams, Democracy and Social Ethics (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2002).8 George Herbert Mead, Mind, Self and Society, vol. 111 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934).9 Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, trans.

I hope that juxtaposing and articulating them from my particular perspective serves to refresh them, and thereby bring them in new ways to the consideration of the design community. As a design researcher and educator, my praxis is informed by American pragmatism — Dewey’s active inquiry, expansive aesthetics, and problem- centered pedagogy;6 Jane Addams’s pragmatism in action: relationality, contextualization, diversity, and ethics of care;7 George Herbert Mead’s perspectives on relations between self and community.8 It also leans on Brazilian educator and philosopher Paolo Freire’s commitment to praxis as theory in action — combining creative reflection and thoughtful action to transform the world;9 and feminist philosophies — a critical commitment to self-reflexivity, contextuality of knowledge, and (more-than-human) em-powerment.10 My stance is research-oriented and practically informed. I teach and supervise into second and third cycle (master’s and PhD) design research programs in Scandinavia and elsewhere, and make occasional forays into undergraduate education, using the same research-oriented methods. My primary areas of expertise are embodied design, and partici-patory, speculative, and critical research-through-design. I have an uncon-ventional education — I transitioned from professional practice into a design master’s program; I hold a PhD but do not have an undergraduate degree. My professional experience includes live art, working with food and devel-oping policy advice. From these divergent perspectives, I reflect on what research-oriented design students might expect of the academy, what the world might need from design, and thus what I, as a design research edu-cator need to deliver. I begin with post-disciplinarity.Post-DisciplinarityFeminist studies scholar Nina Lykke explains that while her field can be in-terpreted as an independent field of knowledge production, it “should claim its innovative force and academic authority in contrast to traditional discipli-narily specialized ways of organizing scholarly knowledge;” and “keep alive the tension that is embedded in defining itself both as a field of knowledge production in its own right and as a field characterized by a total openness to transversal dialogues, crossing all disciplinary boundaries.”11 This double stance is what makes Feminist Studies a post-disciplinary discipline (or post-discipline). I suggest her reasoning can be applied word for word to design research, to the benefit of the field. From this perspective, design research renegotiates not only the content of science and knowledge production, but also what Donna Haraway calls its thinking technologies,12 including its “modes of working and organizing, critically posing questions such as, ‘What kind of phenomena are science and scholarly knowledge production? How should they be carried out to reach good results? What is a good result? What does it mean to work and write in a scholarly way? Which kinds of organiza-tional structures give the optimal basis for reaching good results’?”13 she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 202017314 Doreen Massey, “Negotiating Disciplinary Boundaries,” Current Sociology 47, no. 4 (1999): 5–12, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0011392199047004003; Stephen Edelston Toulmin, Return to Reason (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009); Tomas Hellström, Merle Jacob, and Søren Barlebo Wenneberg, “The ‘Discipline’ of Post-Academic Science: Reconstructing the Paradigmatic Foundations of a Virtual Re-search Institute,” Science and Public Policy 30, no. 4 (2003): 251–60, DOI: https://doi.org/10.3152/147154303781780407.15 Alan Blackwell et al., “Creating Value across Boundaries: Maximising the Return from Interdisciplinary Innovation” (re-search report, UK National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, 2010), https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/creating_value_across_boundaries.pdf.16 Michael Gibbons, The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies (London: Sage, 1994).17 Tim Coles, C.

Indeed, when disciplinary concerns dominate, salient issues may be rendered in-visible.14 So while disciplines per se are not abandoned, a post-disciplinary researcher tries to remain vigilant to their limitations, and in doing so, test their boundaries and contribute to their growth. This approach runs counter to the interdisciplinary approach to innovation that brings together knowledge from different research disciplines to generate ideas.15 It offers an emergent and responsive approach to complex, contemporary issues in ways that transgress disciplinary — and other siloed — ways of thinking. When taking a post-disciplinary approach to applied research, knowledge emerges from the context of application with “distinct theoretical structures, research methods and modes of practice which may not be locatable on the prevailing disciplinary map.”16 This stance enables researchers to respond to the situated concerns at hand. Post-disciplinarity is routine in public and private sector consultancy, for example in the service industries.17 Bringing this mindset into a university structure enables researchers, educators, and students to bring divergent perspectives to a context of concern, converge existing approaches, and invent new ones in response to emergent issues. Design research is at once multifaceted, theoretically engaged, and ap-plied. These characteristics position it ideally to embrace post- disciplinarity as a pathway to move beyond siloed understandings of problems, and co-create, with stakeholders, radically new ways of responding to challenges and concerns. When designers understand “how to use the specialized knowledge of all the different disciplines involved in [a] task in a way that best produces a positive outcome”18 they can support themselves, their team, and others to reinvigorate how we approach wicked problems and grand societal challenges. A post-disciplinary stance can assist designers in evolving their practice and step up to challenges in ways that are at once empowered and empowering.—Takeaway: Skill in post-disciplinary practice will benefit designers who wish to engage with wicked problems and global challenges.The Grandest Challenge?In 2009, Johan Rockström and his colleagues19 identified nine planetary boundaries, beyond which we risk triggering earth system tipping points, uncontrollable ecosystem feedback loops, and an unsafe operating space for humans. We have long transgressed several of these global thresholds,20 and as a result are experiencing more extreme and complex weather events and accelerating species extinctions.21 With business as usual, we might expect increasingly catastrophic outcomes.22 This problem is a global challenge — one of four challenges for design education identified by Ken Friedman23 — and is currently not well covered by design education.24 And yet, it touches every material interaction that humans enact.

Yet our current food system is making both people and planet sick.26 Fortunately, if the science is right, it is not too late to reverse this trend.27 We need to reconnect our everyday actions and our development pathways with the biosphere’s capacity to sus-tain them. Experts tell us that this challenge is neither a science problem nor a technology problem — it is a problem with our sociopolitical values.28 We need social change29 to shift the beliefs, attitudes, values, and societal struc-tures that drive our behaviors; to rebuild our cultures from the bottom up; and to develop new models for living.30 How to make this shift is an intricate design problem; to address it we need to be educating designers and design researchers, positioning it as both background and foreground for every single design action. As Manzini eloquently stresses, “These changes require designers to rethink themselves, to rethink how they operate and reshape their position in society.”31 I propose that they require designers to forge new kinds of collaborative partnerships and engage with new kinds of knowledge in an ongoing, self-reflexive, regenerative process. —Takeaway: The ability to think and discuss design beyond the discipline itself will enable designers to forge new kinds of collaborative partnerships and engage with new kinds of knowledge, in an ongoing, self-reflexive, regenerative process; this will enable designers to continually renew our discipline towards locally situated, globally sensitive impact.—In 2013, Melissa Leach, Kate Raworth, and Johan Rockström32 mapped out social and planetary boundaries, to delineate an alternative, just pathway for sustainable development. “Just as there are planetary boundaries beyond which lies environmental deg-radation that is dangerous for humanity, so too there are social boundaries below which lie resource deprivations that endanger human well-being…. Combining the inner limits of social boundaries and the outer limits of planetary boundaries … creates a doughnut-shaped space within which all of humanity can thrive by pursuing a range of possible pathways that could deliver inclusive and sustainable development.” (Figures 1–3). Their framework clarifies one of humanity’s major challenges: ensuring “that the use of Earth’s resources achieves the human rights of all ... while simultaneously ensuring that the total pressure on Earth systems remains within planetary boundaries.”33 This model is not without critics. Latin American environmentalist Eduardo Gudynas,34 cautions we cannot forget the long tradition of debates on development and the environment,35 nor uncritically adopt Western concepts of development. We must break with anthropocentric ethics and acknowledge the rights of nature. In the new ethic, rather than separating environmental and social components, some would be contained within others. We need non-Western voices, to make such shifts.Building on this research, the Digital Revolution and Sustainable Devel-opment: Opportunities and Challenges36 report details six transformations she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020ationTOOHSREVOcpohellumtionicalgdinan &egnitrophosphorus loclimatechangee rnozo n e la yde pletiothe s af e  aSE C O L O G ICAL CEILINGj u s t space for hn d O C I A L  FOUNDATIONwaterfoodumanityaoccidificeanenergyhealthnetworkshousinggenderequalityLLAFeducationTROHSincome& workpeace &justicesocialequitypoliticalvoiceREGENERATIVE AND DIST R I B U T I VO M YNOCE  Elandconversionreta w a l sr e s h w at h d rw ifniotullopriabiodilvoesrssityBeyond the boundaryBoundary not quantifiedye rnozo n e lade pleti oclimatechangeE C O L O G ICAL CEILINGE N V I R O N M ENTAL CEILINGaoccidificeanw a t e rfoodO C I A L  FOUNDATIONhealthenerg ySniotullopriabiodilvoesrssityskrowtenhousinggeeqnudealityrLLAFTROHSeducationekmroowcin & ationTOOHSREVOcphoellumtiioncalgndin &as loegp hosphorunitrop e ace &ju sticesocialequityp o li c a l tiv o i c elandconversionrtea w a l sf r e s h w at h d rw i175Figure 1Raworth’s “Doughnut Diagram.” Between the social and planetary boundaries lies an environmentally safe and socially just space in which humanity can thrive.

Education, Gender, and Inequality. Involving ministries of education, science and technology, gender equality and family affairs, this transformation covers investments in education (early childhood development, primary and secondary education, vocational training and higher education), social protection systems and labor standards, and R&D. It directly targets SDGs 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10, and reinforces other SDG outcomes. Health, Wellbeing, and Demography. Group interventions to ensure Universal Health Coverage (UHC), promote healthy behaviors, and address social determinants of health and wellbeing. It directly targets SDGs 2, 3, and 5 with strong synergies into many other goals. Implementation will need to be led by ministries of health. Energy Decarbonization and Sustainable Industry. This transformation groups investments in energy access; the decarbonization of power, trans-port, buildings, and industry; and curbing industrial pollution. It directly targets SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 11–15, and reinforces several other goals. Implementation will require coordination across a large number of industries, including energy, transport, buildings, and environment. Sustainable Food, Land, Water, and Oceans. Interventions to make food and other agricultural or forest production systems more produc-tive and resilient to climate change must be coordinated with efforts to conserve and restore biodiversity; and interventions to promote healthy diets alongside major reductions in food waste and losses. Important trade-offs exist between these interventions, so we recommend identifying and addressing them inside one transformation, which will need to mobilize a broad range of ministries, such as agriculture, forestry, environment, natural resources, and health. This broad transformation directly promotes SDGs 2, 3, 6, and 12–15. Many other SDGs are reinforced by these investments. 5. Sustainable Cities and Communities. Cities, towns, and other communities require integrated investments in infrastructure, urban services, as well as resilience to climate change. These interventions target of course SDG 11 and they also contribute directly to goals 6, 9, and 11. Indirectly virtually all SDGs are support-ed by this transformation, which relies on leadership from the ministries of transport, urban development, and water resources. 6. Harnessing the Digital Revolution for Sustainable Development. If managed well, digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and modern communication technologies can make major contributions towards virtually all SDGs.necessary to achieve dramatic improvements on the UN World Sustainability Development Goals and move us back into the safe operating space for hu-manity (Table 1).37 These transformations read as management and coordi-nation issues. Yet, without widespread societal integration — broad-reaching acceptance and uptake — they will not gain traction. The work of Raworth, Leach, Rockström, and Sachs and his colleagues is critically important as we try to grapple with global challenges. At the same time, we cannot sweep aside the concerns raised by Gudynas.38 In an address to the 2019 UN Sustainable Development Transformation Forum, Daniel Hausknost39 suggests that the Western approach to sustainable development is “dying of improvement,” driven by three myths: 1) green growth;40 2) a belief in — and reliance on — conscious individual behavior she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 202017741 Hausknost, “Tackling the Political Economy.”42 Carl DiSalvo, Johan Redström, and Matt Watson, “Commentaries on the Special Issue on Practice-Oriented Approaches to Sustainable HCI,” ACM Transaction on Computer–Human Interaction 20, no. 4 (2013): article no. 26, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/2509404.2509408; Terry Irwin, “Transition Design: A Proposal for a New Area of Design Practice, Study, and Re-search,” Design and Culture 7, no. 2 (2015): 229–46, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/17547075.2015.1051829; Bran Knowles et al., “Design Patterns, Principles, and Strategies for Sustainable HCI,” in Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New York: ACM, 2016), 3581–88, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/2851581.2856497; Victor Margolin, The Politics of the Artifi-cial: Essays on Design and Design Studies (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2018); Ankita Raturi et al., “Designing Sus-tainable Food Systems,” in Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New York: ACM, 2017), 609–16, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3027063.3027075.43 Blevis, “Seeing What Is and What Can Be.”44 Light et al., “Design for Existential Crisis.”45 Escobar, Designs for the Pluriverse.46 Manzini, Design, When Everybody Designs.47 Richard Dobbs et al., “Resource Revolution: Meeting the World’s Energy, Materials, Food, and Water Needs,” McKinsey & Company, 2011, accessed May 18, 2020, https://www.mckinsey.com/busi-ness-functions/sustainability/our-insights/resource-revolution; Martin L.

When subjected to critical scru-tiny, none of these myths holds. We need to move away from such thinking. A “purposive and time-bound transformation entails non-linear, disruptive, and, by definition, unpredictable forms of change, and … political insti-tutions with the capacity, power, and legitimacy to make transformative decisions of creative destruction.”41 Or — as Hausknost starkly characterizes our current position — we can continue to talk about transformation without actually meaning transformation and govern ourselves into irreversible climate collapse.—Takeaway: These intertwined challenges suggest that, if design is to con-structively engage in world-making, design researchers need to be inter-linking situated concerns, planetary science, and governance. —I am not alone in believing that design should respond to this challenge, and is increasingly well-positioned to do so.42 Blevis posits sustainability as a foundational imperative of design;43 Light and colleagues declare climate change an existential crisis — not only for humanity but for design as a disci-pline.44 In Designs for the Pluriverse, Escobar provides a new vision for design theory and practice aimed at channeling design’s world-making capacity toward ways of being and doing that are deeply attuned to justice and the Earth.45 His vision of locally organized, radical interdependence further politicizes Manzini’s thesis that everyone designs.46 It foregrounds the need to acknowledge and empower people from all walks of life to (re)interpret and (re)design products, services, and materials to fit their situated needs; and empower them to take ownership of the innovation process.In the top-down, dominant model for climate change response, econ-omists develop policy mechanisms to internalize the external ecological and moral costs of an individual’s or country’s actions on others.47 They then appeal to governments to inform, educate, and persuade citizens to respond to climate change.48 This approach places the onus on individuals to align their actions with policy directives. It “obscure(s) the extent to which governments sustain unsustainable economic institutions and ways of life, and the extent to which they have a hand in structuring options and possibilities.”49 It is shaped by normative epistemologies and goals including faith in technological progress and universal conceptions of the public and the public good.50 In contrast, bottom-up approaches to capacity building and policy-making from participatory design, research through design and co-design,51 common issues to empower civil society actors to be collabora-tive agents for systemic change. Such approaches recognize climate risks as both product and driver of social and natural systems and their interaction.52 They leverage design’s capacities for world-making to help people imagine and then prototype radical change. In doing so, they open the door towards a more profound engagement with the climate crisis, ownership of transfor-mational ideas, recognition of their relevance to personal situated experi-ence and thus a shift from invention to transformative innovation, through societal integration.

At their most effective, [they] inspire people to make changes for themselves and … inspire others to follow.53 If we are to make a systemic shift from the top-down model, we require systems and frameworks that empower people from civil and civic society to engage interdependently in creative world-making. Working together, individuals and communities would benefit from articulating, and perhaps reconfiguring, their desires; imagining new practices that are desirable and fit within the safe and just space for humanity; resourcing and developing infrastructure for these practices — new policies, technologies, relation-ships — so they might be adopted, adapted to unique circumstances, and also proliferate. This process would enable us to evolve our values and tradi-tions, by using situated practice as a pathway to cultural transformation. To be sustainable, underlying design actions must be directed towards aligning policy, techno-science, and creative engagement across the board towards social, material, cultural, political, and ecological sustainability. That means transforming the values that drive business, government and scientific re-search as well as everyday situated actions. —Takeaways: Familiarity with sustainability science, environmental human-ities, economics, and environmental politics and governance54 will enable design researchers’ to better respond to global challenges, with the added benefit that the learning process will further their capacity for effective post-disciplinary practice. Designers need to be willing to engage with divergent perspectives and situated understandings of what is considered valuable by different actors, to ensure a plurality of voices inform their work. They need skills in creative practices and bottom-up approaches to world-making and policymaking to be able to move fluidly between diverse and divergent disciplines and worldviews and direct design actions towards aligning policy, techno-scientific research, and creative engagement.—In the next two sections, I argue that capacities in sustainability brokering and anticipation may strengthen designers’ ability to develop that famil-iarity, those skills, and that fluidity.Sustainability BrokeringDrawing on the management sciences,55 Leach and colleagues explain that “navigating the complex, uncertain world and dynamic thresholds that chal-lenge sustainability requires us to track between big-picture planetary and social boundaries and the ways they interact in particular local settings.56 Global and regional scenarios, forecasting, and backcasting need to be trian-gulated with grounded local processes and implications. An understanding of shifting global planetary boundaries, safe operating spaces, and the global SDGs required to stay within them needs to be combined with appreciation of particular local, sustainable development meanings and goals, and of how to draw from innovative grassroots capacity. Such sustainability brokering involves skills and competencies that are currently seriously neglected. Building these requires new kinds of training, capacity building, and recognition. she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 202017957 Leach et al., “Transforming Innovation for Sustainability,” 5, emphasis mine.58 Ibid., 1.59 Westley et al., “Tipping toward Sustainability.”60 Wendell Bell, Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes and Knowledge, vol. 1 (London: Transaction Publishers, 2003).61 For examples of the method in applica-tions, see “Alliance for Strategic Sustain-able Development,” accessed May 23, 2020, http://www.alliance-ssd.org/.62 Göran Broman, John Holmberg, and Karl-Henrik Robört, “Simplicity Without Reduction: Thinking Upstream Towards the Sustainable Society,” Interfaces 30, no. 3 (2000): 13–25, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1287/inte.30.3.13.11662; John Holmberg, “Backcasting: A Natural Step in Operationalising Sustainable Development,” Greener Management International, Autumn 1998, available at Gale Academic OneFile, accessed May 22, 2020, https://go.gale.com/ps/anon-ymous?id=GALE%7CA55308829&sid=-googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkac-cess=abs&issn=09669671&p=A-ONE&sw=w.63 Joan Manuel F Mendoza et al., “Inte-grating Backcasting and Eco-Design for the Circular Economy: The BECE Framework,” Journal of Industrial Ecology 21, no. 3 (2017): 526–44, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12590; Josefin Wangel, “Change by Whom?

I am the only design researcher involved.Guided by wider political debate about values, interests, and priorities … sustainability brokers could form the vanguard of transformation now needed to safeguard our planet for current and future generations.”57 The type of transformative innovation they describe gives greater recogni-tion and power to grassroots innovation actors and processes, and involves them within an inclusive, multi-scale innovation politics.58 The skills and competencies needed include the capacity to anticipate shocks, support engagement, and co-create; the ability to conduct careful design and facil-itation, resourced by research geared to stakeholders’ needs; and creative, cross-sector, and cross-disciplinary decision making and innovation. Sustain-ability brokers also need the capacity to design processes to sustain knowl-edge integration and behavioral change; and build worldwide communities of like-minded people cutting across disciplinary divides, eventually bound together by trust and by shared values and understandings.59 Critically, it involves backcasting, an approach from Future Studies.60 In contrast to forecasting — trying to predict the future from today’s trends — back-casting begins by defining the objective and then asking “what shall we do today (and subsequently) to achieve the objective?”61 The method involves four steps. 1) Define conditions for a sustainable future — for example, aligning with the just space for humanity identified by Leach, Raworth and Rockström. 2) Analyze situated activities and competencies in relation to these conditions. 3) Envision future possibilities, free of existing con-straints. 4) Identify strategies to link the present situation with the desirable future sustainable situation.62 When approached interdependently, these steps enable people to define objectives, sensitive to local conditions. Thus, through a focus on the desired future state, rather than the problematic present, and involving diverse stakeholders in the process — including grass-roots innovation actors and processes — backcasting assists people to leap-frog iterative development63 and enact transformative innovation.Sustainability brokering sounds suspiciously like design as I know it — participatory, experimental, and collaborative research through design, informed by principles of equity, access, diversity, and social justice; bringing scientific knowledge around the SDGs and planetary boundaries together with deep engagement in grassroots, situated practices. My experience also suggests that design research is what many scientists in sustainability sci-ence are looking for … although they may not realize it.64 The questions, thus — for design research education, as well as practice — become, “Are de-signers (researchers and educators) ready to tackle the role of sustainability brokers?” “Are we able to use the social and planetary boundaries, and the notion of a just operating system as guiding principles, as we respond to situ-ated concerns?” The idea is to engage with all 17 sustainability development goals and 169 specific targets, while ensuring deeply informed consideration of planetary impact as situated research unfolds — rather than simply using these boundaries as a checklist.The larger question of this article is, “If design is to effectively engage with global challenges, how do we educate for such roles?” To this I might add, “Does design have an image crisis?” My answer to the latter is yes, for three reasons. First, design is not a homogenous ecosystem; however, the dominant Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns18065 Participatory design, co-design, bio- design, and others.66 Geoffrey Tweedale and Philip Hansen, “Protecting the Workers: The Medical Board and the Asbestos Industry, 1930s–1960s,” Medical History 42, no. 4 (1998): 439–57, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/s0025727300064346.67 For example, see Papanek, Design for the Real World.68 Neimanis et al., “Four Problems.”69 For a range of compelling examples, see John Thackara, How to Thrive in the Next Economy (London: Thames & Hudson, 2015); Paul Hawken, ed., Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming (London: Penguin, 2017); Julia Watson, Lo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism (Colonge: Taschen, 2020); Pablo Calderón Salazar, Mela Zuljevic, and Liesbeth Huybrechts, “Southern Manners in Northern Lands: Design Interventions for Autonomía,” Strategic Design Research Journal 11, no. 2 (2018): 103–14, https://doi.org/10.4013/sdrj.2018.112.06; Figueres and Rivett- Carnac, The Future We Choose; “Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Devel-opment,” http://www.alliance-ssd.org/.70 For a discussion, see Johan Redström, “Certain Uncertainties and the Design of Design Education,” She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics and Innovation 6, no. 1 (2020): 83–100, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2020.02.001.71 Ibid.72 For example, see Danielle Wilde and Jenny Underwood, “Designing towards the Unknown: Engaging with Material and Aesthetic Uncertainty,” Informatics, Special Issue on Tangible and Embodied Interaction 5, no. 1 (2018): 13, DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/informatics5010001.cultural understanding of design seems to be adding aesthetic sophistica-tion to material products. Second, wide swathes of the design industry are complicit in many of the problems we need to address. Third, the types of design practice oriented towards achieving more just societies65 — more socially, materially, and ecologically regenerating societies — are relatively alien to anyone who hasn’t had first-hand experience with them. What design research can bring to global challenges is thus little known by many of the (government, industry, scientific, and civil society) actors who might benefit from collaboration with design researchers, expert in such methods.Transformative innovation requires we move far beyond solution-oriented approaches to problem solving. We need to engage with complex systems and have the humility to recognize that any seemingly positive contribution we make may come with bigger headaches later on. For instance, asbestos resolved a number of issues in the building industry with extraordinary efficacy but is still causing health issues around the world today — more than a hundred years after the first documented death.66 We need to move beyond a search for efficient solutions, and deepen our understanding of what might be at stake. Many negative impacts on human and planetary life, throughout history, can be traced back to acts of design.67 Today, many designers remain complicit in the creation of complex issues. As a community, we must act — and we must do so with care. Design shapes the world we live in. Rigorous design research, in particular when approached from intersectional perspectives, can combine theory, practice, and creativity in unique ways. The grand challenge of reconfiguring how humans live within our planetary and social boundaries demands a response. The design community cannot stand to the side, nor can we resolve this issue on our own. As a community of practice, we must participate, collaborate, and invite participation in the act of brokering transformative innovation. We can look to resilience and sus-tainability science, economics, environmental humanities, and critical post-humanities68 for clues as to how to engage across disciplinary boundaries, fortify our post-disciplinary practice, and broker sustainability. We can — and should — also look elsewhere: to other fields, sectors and other forms of action.69 In any case, the experimental nature of design research enables us to expand what we might imagine by thinking through moving, making, and situated doing. Design makes things possible in the face of uncertainties.70 And, while I agree with Redström, that “we cannot ignore the issue of how to make design less certain of itself,”71 I also know that design has experience and methods for staying with uncertainty and designing into the unknown.72 We must draw upon this experience, develop relevant capacities, and ap-proach grand challenges with humility.—Takeaways: The grand challenge of design education appears to be twofold: i) Equip designers to innovate transformatively, by developing the neces-sary skills and capacities to broker sustainability and anticipate trans-formative innovation; andii) Ensure actors across society recognize the potential of design — beyond material and interaction aesthetics — so that designers may leverage their world-making skills towards profound and meaningful impact.she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 202018173 For more information, visit https://theconversation.com.74 For more information, visit https://medium.com.75 Alexander Leicht, Julia Heiss, and Won Jung Byun, eds., Issues and Trends in Education for Sustainable Development (Paris: UNESCO, 2018), available at https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445.76 William Colglazier, “Sustainable Devel-opment Agenda: 2030,” Science 349, no. 6252 (2015): 1048–50, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad2333; William M.

While many programs deliver some of these skills, I am unaware of any that deliver all of them in ways that foreground the design research strength of thinking through moving, making, and doing throughout. And yet, I posit that embodied engagement with the materiality of our world — thinking through moving, making, and (situated) doing — is what transforms such activities into design research skills.To respond to (ii): Design researchers must be skilled in diverse forms of dissemination — not only peer-reviewed publication, websites, and social media. For instance, they may maintain longer form blogs; make efforts to have their work featured in magazines; write for accessible fora such as The Conversation73 and Medium;74 produce non-scholarly books; postcards, posters, video, zines, and more. To create this material will require them to reframe their work at each step. It will enrich their understanding of the research, as it unfolds. In the process, they may consider their potential contributions from scientific, methodological, cultural, and designerly per-spectives — and become effectual in ways that move radically beyond siloed understandings of academic relevance and impact.Anticipation When developing their 2018 Issues and Trends in Education for Sustainable Development report,75 UNESCO built on profoundly considered bottom-up guidelines including Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 and more.76 They concluded that if we are to achieve sustainable development, “individuals must learn to understand the complexities, uncertainties, trade-offs, and risks related to global and local sustainability challenges. They must become ‘sustainability citizens’ … [who] participate in socio-political processes, moving their soci-eties towards sustainable development.”77 The authors articulate eight key competencies crucial for people to think and act in favor of sustainable development: systems thinking, anticipa-tion, normative competency, strategic competency, collaboration, critical thinking, self-awareness, and integrated problem-solving. Sustainability citizenship depends on the interplay of all eight competencies with people’s values and motivational drivers, and relevant opportunities.78 Some — such as systems thinking, critical thinking, and self-awareness — might be con-sidered prerequisites for others. In this section, I focus on anticipation. Anticipation enables us to move from future imaginaries to new practices (oriented towards long-term flourishing) that can be implemented today. The field of Anticipation Studies79 champions a pathway akin to design world-making processes and backcasting to develop policies and tech-nologies to support the newly imagined practices.

Implementable nows are transformative innova-tions that can be implemented today. The aim is to envision divergent new practices for today, inspired by future imaginaries, and then infrastructure them. Rather than forecasting, the process leapfrogs the adjacent possible to articulate eminently more desirable — perhaps wildly fantastic — futures, unconstrained by existing poor choices or perceived technological limits, then backcasts to work out what the next step might be. Once the next steps have been identified, local actors forge new relationships and (as required) work in collaboration with industry, government, scientists, policymakers, and technology developers, to resource the newly imagined practices. This process is context dependent, so cannot be systematized here, though many successful examples may be found.81 In its entirety, the approach enables actors to bypass iterative development and make actionable, transformative leaps. Anticipation involves stakeholders from civil and civic society. It flattens existing hierarchies by involving and recognizing individual felt experience and phenomenologically grounded expertise. It thus affords bottom-up transformation of top-down systems and structures from within. Such a pro-cess encompasses the two necessary but distinct components of anticipation: “a forward-looking attitude and the use of the former’s results for action.”82 It leans powerfully on Beckert’s notion that imaginaries of future situations can provide orientation in decision making, despite the incalculability of outcomes.83 It allows actors “to move beyond inherited thought patterns and categories by bringing them into an as-if world in which given reality is surpassed and a different one considered.”84 In essence, anticipation lever-ages design’s world-making capacities to generate new practices, policies, technologies, and relationships. In doing so, it ensures these are personally meaningful, contextually relevant, and ecologically impactful. It connects to language that policymakers are engaging with through UNESCO and venues such as the Anticipation Conference (which brings together policymakers with researchers from future studies, anticipation studies and design).85 It facilitates the process, and furthers the cause, of legitimizing design re-search as a critical twenty-first-century practice.Anticipation competency can be instructed via mastery of existing exper-imental design methods, and reconfiguring them to unique research con-texts.

As numerous participatory and co-design scholars demonstrate, this infrastructuring pro-cess invigorates democracy, sustains participation and design-for-future-use at community and societal scales; and is necessary to move from ideas to action and implement change.94 To enact it, designers need to draw from (and move fluidly between) diverse and divergent disciplines and world views. They must take a post-disciplinary approach to the application of the methods, frameworks, and theories that make design research a pow-erful force for imagining and spearheading real-world change. Educating design researchers with these skills will equip them to support the emer-gence of new social imaginaries — collective beliefs about how society func-tions — that can enable or disable societal transformation and are critical to its realization.95 It will equip them to critically consider present imaginaries alongside lost or forgotten historical practices and existing infrastructure, and support participants from civil and civic society to understand, imagine, and work together towards transformative innovation that has real-world social, ecological, and policy impact. —Takeaways: Designers need skills in experimental participatory design and co-design methods. They must learn to draw from, and move fluidly between, diverse and divergent disciplines and worldviews as they apply methods, frameworks, and theories. They require facilitation and re-sourcing skills. And, they need fluency in all eight competencies identified by UNESCO: systems thinking, anticipation, normative competency, strategic competency, collaboration, critical thinking, self-awareness, and integrated problem-solving — in particular anticipation. Revolution–izing DesignOur global challenges unfold in the context of the fourth industrial revolu-tion. In 2016, the World Economic Forum positioned this revolution as the most intense and important challenge that humans must grapple with.96 The first industrial revolution was the shift to fossil fuels for energy and mechanical power. The second (in the decades around 1900) brought break-throughs in electricity distribution, wireless and wired communication, the synthesis of ammonia, and new forms of power generation. The third began in the 1950s, with the development of digital systems communica-tion, advances in computing power, and new ways of generating, processing and sharing information. The fourth industrial revolution is the fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The velocity, scope, and systems impact — the sheer speed of cur-rent breakthroughs — of this industrial revolution has no historical prece-dent. It is disrupting almost every industry in every country, and is expected to transform entire systems of production, management, and governance.97 This revolution is not without challenges.98 As Rabeh Morrar, Hussam Arman, and Saeed Mousa stress, we need to create the conditions for the fourth industrial revolution and associated emerging technologies, in ways that bring new opportunities and benefits to people and society, and are Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns18499 Rabeh Morrar, Husam Arman, and Saeed Mousa, “The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0): A Social Innovation Perspective,” Technology Innovation Management Review 7, no. 11 (2017): 12–20, available at https://timreview.ca/article/1117.100 William Gaver, “What Should We Expect from Research through Design?,” in CHI ’12: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New York: ACM, 2012), 937–46, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208538.101 Nigel Cross, “Designerly Ways of Knowing,” Design Studies 3, no. 4 (1982): 221–27, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/0142-694X(82)90040-0.also sustainable. At the same time, we must remedy the damage to society caused by the last three revolutions.99 To ensure innovations are societally relevant and also sustainably responsive to global needs and situated con-cerns requires the involvement of diverse stakeholders. I propose participa-tory research through design, guided by four pillars of practice, as a viable pathway to this end.—Takeaways: For designers to be empowered actors in the fourth indus-trial revolution, they need to be skilled in physical, digital, and biological spheres. They require the capacity to respond to — and shape — rapid, even unexpected advances in technology that are sensitive to societal and envi-ronmental impact. Principles in PracticeFor the remainder of the article, I lay out the practices and principles that guide my pedagogical work, moving from the ultimate particular of research concerns to the broader dilemma of designing for what we do not under-stand. I describe my foundational methodology of participatory research through design; present four multi-faceted pillars developed to enable un-dergraduate and master’s students to build a sophisticated research practice; and propose a work plan for building research capacity in a doctoral design school. The ideas are not groundbreaking. But my experience suggests that many research students are not assimilating them. Articulating them as a framework — pillars which frame the construction of research — is helpful. When applied consistently across an education, the methodology and pil-lars result in students who critically engage with twenty-first-century chal-lenges in sophisticated ways, researching through design. I begin with the methodology.Participatory Research through DesignResearch through design (RtD) is a critical design practice that engages divergent ways of knowing, sensing, and being at the service of a research inquiry. It makes use of designerly activities as a way of approaching messy situations with unclear or conflicting agendas;100 privileges synthesis and experimentation rather than studying a problem, to solve it.101 RtD opens new perspectives on a research object, and may lead to unexpectedly rich responses to an inquiry and to new questions. Participatory RtD extends RtD, by drawing on participatory design, co-design, critical and speculative design practices. In participatory RtD, the design researcher engages partic-ipants in a) critical reflection and social critique through everyday activities, and b) embodied engagement in creative play with research ideas and tech-niques — all while the research is in process. Participatory RtD thus affords participant-led (as well as designer-led) first-person perspective approaches to RtD, and thence the research object. It makes stakeholder engagement in discussions around possible futures, as well as consideration of broad poten-tialities of emerging propositions as they unfold achievable. It enables the she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020185102 Elizabeth B.-N.

Further, it enables designers, research teams, and participating experts to experiment with where control is situated. Significantly, in participatory RtD, the designer is not the expert. Instead, they acknowledge other stakeholders’ expertise and capacity to contribute to a design response that is rich and democratic. Participatory RtD brings differing perspectives to bear on creative decision making; and enables researchers to navigate tensions of difference, articulate more precisely and realistically what might be meaningful for stakeholders with divergent values, and identify which benefits to aim for.102 In practice, participants engage with and prototype artefacts, ideas, practices, and experiences to col-lectively and critically reflect on research questions and emergent responses. Throughout these processes, designers draw on participant feedback in a hermeneutic cycle of creativity and self-reflection — information and find-ings are used to find ways forward and also revisit previous considerations. In this applied action-reflection approach, making, testing, and experi-menting serve as a form of negotiation of emergent ideas. As a research technique, participatory RtD assists people in bringing into language things that they may not previously have reflected on or tried to articulate. It makes use of design research methods such as generative toolkits103 and thinking through moving, making, and (often situated) doing to critically engage with present conditions; it leverages estrangement104 to open participant stakeholders to exchange unfiltered views and surface new possibilities.105 If we take the example of food-related research: experimental, partici-patory RtD activities might include eating, foraging, using food to visualize data, co-developing dining experiences, or otherwise enjoying convivial activities that prompt people to constructively reframe, reconsider, and reconceptualize a problem space — and thence build more complex, situated understandings.106 Food is personally meaningful, and culturally, politically, and ecologically charged. It also acts like social glue. Further, as Petra Bauer and Sofia Wiberg remind us, “Cooking is such a simple thing to do together, and the roles can be overturned in who has knowledge, who has power in a specific situation, and who knows what.”107 Food provides a familiar and potent context through which to negotiate understandings of the present, and partial visions of possible futures. Whatever form the participation takes in participatory RtD, the process draws from related research; incorporates situated concerns; uses critical reflection and social critique through everyday activities; and deploys em-bodied engagement with creative play to prompt expanded consideration of the subject of study and give rise to new possibilities for action. As a methodology, participatory RtD is made fit for purpose by col-liding participatory, collaborative, speculative, and critical design with anticipation studies, science and technology studies, sustainability science (discussed above), and a feminist ethics of care.108 Doing so connects the designer to an evolving and growing effort to rework the role of the human-ities and their relation to science, technology, art and contemporary society.

Participatory RtD positions the designer and designed in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, bringing mindful attention to social and ecological sustainability as critically intertwined concerns.The theoretical underpinnings of participatory RtD, and how the theory plays out in practice, is unpacked at.110 What is important to note here is that participatory research-through-design acknowledges that capacity for agency extends beyond human actors to include human, non-human and inanimate materials and relationships.111 It opens research–assemblages to new forms of reading, so that materials can be evaluated by their capac-ities to affect.112 This reorientation assists design researchers to radically destabilize how they might otherwise support and read participant actions in a co-design context. Instead of focusing solely on the reactions of human participants, design researchers can bring focus to all of the forces (or affects) operating at the level of actions or events, including those in which the human collaborators play a relatively minor role.113 Take the example of food and data physicalization114 — the practice of bringing data into three-dimensional, material form.115 Eric Baumer and his colleagues116 argue that to achieve nuanced reflection, data must be synthesized by a person, not simply encountered. Such synthesis requires reflecting on the complex relationships that exist between the person’s felt experience — their understanding of what feels right, as well as right for them — and the systems view of what has been measured and how those measurements are represented. By virtue of their physicality, data physical-izations enable exploration and synthesis of data representations through all of the senses and sensorimotor capacities. The body thus becomes an active agent in understanding — people can literally, as well as intellectually and emotionally, “feel” the data, self-reflect, and thereby arrive at nuanced understandings about these relationships, the data, and themselves. Food affords complex interactions between bodily senses through its richly varied, sensorially stimulating material qualities. It resonates personally, socio-culturally, and politically; and as people engage with food it trans-forms — through physical and chemical interactions while cooking, eating, and digesting; and through multi-species engagement as it perishes, grows, and moves.By flattening the hierarchy between these human, non-human, and inanimate materials and relationships, we can arrive at a new materialist ontology, wherein there are “no structures, no systems and no mecha-nisms;” “instead, there are ‘events;’ an endless cascade of events comprising the material effects of both nature and culture that together produce the world.”117 This way of thinking opens the path to responsively craft the human and non-human elements in a research process. By taking ‘things’ seriously, designers and design researchers can “recognize more fully how these [things] come to be constituted and thought in and through particular she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020187116 Eric P.S.

DiSalvo suggests that designers need to be educated to recognize that consensus is not always pos-sible or desirable.121 According to Chantal Mouffe, difference is essential for a pluralistic democratic society, and conflict — expressed as tension, friction, and dissension — defends against the erasure of difference.122 In comple-ment, participatory design scholars stress that “defining what innovation is, who innovates, where and under what conditions innovation occurs is an important battleground within society.”123 Design education needs to equip designers to align different contexts and their representatives; to make vis-ible, perform, and debate differences between current issues; and to prac-tically explore how an alternative future might tangibly unfold today. This process must account for difference. It must acknowledge that first person perspective, embodied experiences are situated, and are central to forming worldviews. Embodied experiences can be invisible and socially constructed. As the preeminent disability theory scholar, Tobin Siebers, explains about disability: it is in part medically constructed, in part socially constructed; the economy between social representations and the body is not unidirectional or non-existent, but reciprocal and thus complexly embodied.124 I propose that this notion of complex embodiment may be applied to all embodied experience, to afford more comprehensive recognition of difference.—Takeaways: Designers need the theoretical background to honor and value the experiences and epistemologies of stakeholders. They must be skilled in negotiating a lack of consensus. Further, they must be skilled in working with complex embodiment as the status quo.Pillars of PracticeUndergraduate and master’s students in particular need frameworks to conduct design research and scaffold post-disciplinary thinking and collab-orative engagement with divergent actors — and to action the recommen-dations I make above. To this end, I articulate four multi-faceted pillars that intertwine research and practice as if indivisible (Table 2). Each pillar is a set of basic questions. I advise my students to cycle through these as they work, hermeneutically building their knowledge as their research unfolds. The research questions and literature review form the foundation for their research, even as these shift and take new forms as the research unfolds.

WHY, WHERE and for WHOM are you doing what you are doing? What is your context of action? Acknowledge the specificity and diversity of sociocultural, political, geographic, and other situated contexts, attitudes, mindsets, bodies, and entanglements. Further, recognize that diversity is often invisible, and people are experts in their own experience.2. HOW are you developing your design outcomes? What are your methods and methodology, for research, practice, and dissemination?3. with WHOM are you conducting your research and development? Who are the experts you collaborate with, and seek out for their professional or personal expertise (and who carry both)?4. WHAT are you developing? What new material and interaction aesthetics, and new (social, technological, fashionable, embodied, wearable, ingestible…) imaginaries does your work bring forth? What role does it play in the journey from speculative futures to “implementable nows”?this foundation, the pillars slowly come together in a unique form, providing strength and structure to the research outcomes. The whole thus serves as an emerging structure on which students can hang their understandings as their targets shift and move; and ensures they attend to critical aspects of research in practice. The Four Pillar Framework enables novice researchers and designers to develop sophisticated work — to ground critical inquiries, whether via research through design, for design, with design, about design, or any other concatenation thereof.125The first pillar, WHY, WHERE and for WHOM … encompasses two research foci: i) the problem, tension point, or area of concern; and ii) the focus within this — the boundaries of the inquiry. It invites the student researcher to consider the context of the design (artifact, system, prac-tice, and so on) in development, from two distinct vantage points: within and without. The view from within constitutes the first-person, situated, embodied experience of the user of the design, and includes their phenom-enological experience of the design itself, and of the world, as mediated by the design. In complement, the view from without constitutes the envi-ronmental context for the design experience, and the perspective of others. Critically, “others” is a shifting target that encompasses the human and non-human things engaging with the design. These can be active or pas-sive, willing or incidental participants, interested or indifferent observers; they may also shift and change over time, as might the circumstances of use. This pillar demands specificity and is crucial in avoiding designs for non-representative, normative ideals. Participatory design research holds a commitment to honoring and valuing the experiences and epistemologies of all stakeholders through theory and practice.126 This pillar assists the researcher to uphold this commitment.

To “queer” is to deconstruct sexuality and gender; see it as a discursive social construction, fluid, plural, and contin-ually negotiated, rather than natural, fixed.127 In relation to participatory design, Jacob (Jenna) McWilliams explains,128“queer theory [is] a framework committed to highlighting and challenging prevailing assumptions about how sexuality and gender shape experiences, identities, and learning. Queer theory has been embraced in some academic disciplines … as a powerful lens through which to interrogate the functions of power, discourse, and the ways in which identities shape and are shaped by social norms around sexuality and gender…. Queer theory is an epistemolog-ical and ontological shift; embraced fully, it demands resistance to or rejection of dominant assumptions about who people are, what learning looks like, and how educational design can and should be undertaken.”As I explain to my students, “that buff white guy” is not in the room. They need to observe real-world diversity, look beyond assumptions, prejudices and stereotypes, and be specific about the many, varied things with which their design engages. The second pillar, HOW … concerns questions of methodology. It requires students to determine what methods they will use, why these methods, how they will use them, and why in that way. It demands they consider dissemination, and thus the type(s) of contribution that might emerge from their inquiry. It prompts them to (re)consider their experi-mental thinking around who should care and why. Who they are designing for, and whether they expect to make scientific, methodological, cultural or designerly contributions. One expects a designerly contribution from design research. When consciously engaged with, (re)consideration of the other types of contribution can open up thinking about the work and who may benefit from learning about it.The third pillar, with WHOM … brings focus to expertise. It concerns expert stakeholders with personal and professional expertise, and considers everyone expert in their own experience. It thus encompasses experimental ethnography, autoethnography, and autobiographical research;129 methods that allow the design researcher to engage with first-person perspectives;130 and “research labs in the wild” — participatory events that conflate lab, field, and showroom131 — to expose early-stage ideas to the scrutiny of diverse publics, so they might be refined to better align with situated concerns before being scaled up and deployed with stakeholders in later stages of the research study.132The fourth pillar, WHAT …, is oriented towards the design object — be it system, practice or artifact — utilized within, or emerging as a product of, the participatory experiments. This pillar invites the student researcher to consider the material and interaction aesthetics of the research objects they develop. It requires cycling back to the first pillar, and considering the phenomenological experience of participants, the relationships between the object and other “things,” and the environment or context of use. It, further, prompts consideration of how research experiments might be bringing forth new social, technological, fashionable, embodied (etc.) imaginaries, and assisting with the journey from speculative futures to real-world change.Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns190133 Wilde et al., “Embodied Design Ideation Methods.”134 Max Liboiron, Alex Zahara, and Ignace Schoot, “Community Peer Review: A Method to Bring Consent and Self- Determination into the Sciences,” June 7, 2018, DOI: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints201806.0104.v1. 135 Barbara Adams, “Crafting Capacities,” in Design as Future-Making, ed.

When working with the pillars, student researchers must continually engage with diversity and ethics, and they must make use of defamiliariza-tion (estrangement) as a strategy to remain off-balance and keep the work alive.133 They must hold equity and access as guiding principles; balance environmental, economic and social justice with humility and solidarity; champion social justice, participation and collaboration; consider commu-nity peer review to bolster claims for societal relevance;134 and enact the scientific method (observe, take notes, analyze) through design practices and experimental ethnography, EVEN AS THEY PARTICIPATE in the worlds they are making. In doing so, they continually cycle through the pillars, her-meneutically building knowledge through experimental means. The frame-work assists them to think in new ways about what constitutes a body, a technology, wearing, being worn, or undertaking whatever activity they are designing. It prompts them to play with scale, and to work with and against the scale of the body — the scale at which most people think and imagine. It asks them to take an expanded view of craft — see it as a fundamentally social way of working with people through the medium and intelligence of materiality.135 It asks for an expanded view of materiality — flattening the hi-erarchies that can arise between bodies, contexts, and research materials.136 Beyond these basics, the framework encourages the student researcher to extend the body — literally, metaphorically, materially, and relationally. To be intimate, startling. To see idiosyncrasy as an opportunity and divergence from norms as vibrant and enriching.137 To design for all kinds of embodi-ment, not only human embodiment. Ask challenging questions. Critically reflect on how to leverage the rich capacities of bodies and imaginations. Actively consider the many, rich and varied ways of being embodied and present; how people might engage with the broad ecosystem impact of our actions, interwoven with, and through, the ecologies we move through.In concrete terms, student researchers use embodied ideation methods to develop interim outcomes and intermediate knowledge.138 The partial resolution of concepts and ideas destabilizes and shifts forward momentum in new directions, so they can surprise themselves and discover something new. These partially-resolved outcomes result in strong pivots: new ways of thinking about and designing for bodies, materials, contexts; new ways to imagine and then design. Students think through moving, making, and situ-ated doing — prototyping emerging ideas in a three-step process. First, they work with materials that are not programmed or (at first glance) program-mable: so-called “lo-tech” materials such as paper, woven and non-woven textiles, tape, and string. They then work with known, perhaps off-the-shelf, technologies and biologies: materials about which we have deep cultural experience and knowledge. Finally, they work with and prototype bespoke, emerging, or yet-to-be-imagined technologies and biologies. This pathway assists them in experimenting wildly and keeping their ideas open for as long as possible so that their creative process is not truncated, and it can give rise to new responses to the issues, dreams, and concerns with which they are engaging. Of course, this process must be carefully handled to ensure teams arrive at outcomes in the time required, and so project management becomes a foundational skill.she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020191139 Stuart Firestein, Ignorance: How It Drives Science (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012). 140 Judith Butler, Giving an Account of Oneself (New York: Fordham University Press, 2009).141 Linda Candy and Ernest Edmonds, “Practice- Based Research in the Cre-ative Arts: Foundations and Futures from the Front Line,” Leonardo 51, no. 1 (2018): 63–69, https://doi.org/10.1162/LEON_a_01471; For a rich, ongoing discus-sion, see the Art of Research conference series “Art of Research 2020 — at Aalto University,” accessed 23 April 2020, https://artofresearch2020.aalto.fi/. Staying in unknowing is not easy. Most people prefer to operate within their abilities — do what they know works, and thus avoid risking failure. Yet, according to physicist James Clerk Maxwell, “Thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science.”139 Not knowing is fundamental to developing something new — a crucial skill with the global challenges we face. It is an ethical issue. Judith Butler tells us “we must recognize that ethics requires us to risk ourselves precisely at moments of unknowingness, when what forms us diverges from what lies before us, when our willingness to become undone in relation to others constitutes our chance of becoming human.”140 This approach to design research pedagogy attempts to support students to grapple with our need to redraw what it is to be human, living on this planet, today. The final steps consist of (re)positioning the process and outcomes in re-lation to existing knowledge, and identifying future research directions. The entire process involves thinking through moving, making and doing, diverse forms of dissemination (the preparation of which is a form of thinking) and thinking through writing. It requires careful project management to afford the necessary curiosity-driven experiments.—Takeaways: Experimental ethnography, including auto-ethnography and autobiographical research, are critical methods should designers wish to de-velop sophisticated, context-sensitive work. Designers need to deepen their engagement with issues of identity, discourses of power, and epistemology, so they can honor and value the experiences and epistemologies of all stake-holders. They need skill in estrangement and the capacity to stay in a place of “not knowing” for as long as possible if they are to develop something new. They also need project management skills to support curiosity-driven exploration and ensure timely results.Building Capacity: Doctoral Training for Design Researchers In this section, I offer a concrete contribution to doctoral training: a work plan to build research capacity in an art and design doctoral school. Doctoral education differs from undergraduate and master’s-level research training, in that its primary purpose is to train designers to become researchers — the focus is on developing (design) research skills, rather than design skills. Doctoral education is hardly new, so on the surface, this task may seem straightforward. However, in art and design — disciplines where practice is paramount and practitioners typically undertake research as a cornerstone of their work — this simple reality raises numerous challenges. Research practices and conceptions of rigor across art and design can diverge consid-erably. Research undertaken for academia is understood differently from research for practice. Practice-based doctoral training is relatively new, and understandings of how to conduct practice-based research are not agreed upon and continue to evolve.141 Unsurprisingly under these conditions, con-sistent evaluation criteria are difficult to define, and institutions can struggle to know how to support doctoral candidates.

Thomas Markus-sen and his colleagues (building on Eva Brandt and Thomas Binder) describe dynamic research sketching, see Thomas Markussen et al., “Dynamic Research Sketching: A New Explanatory Tool for Understanding Theory Construction in Design Research,” in Proceedings of the 8th International Design Research Society Conference (Bangkok, Thailand: Chulalongkorn University, 2012); Eva Brandt and Thomas Binder, “Experi-mental Design Research: Genealogy, Intervention, Argument” (Paper pre-sented at International Association of Societies of Design Research 2007, Hong Kong, China), available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262037737.I propose a six-phase work plan to recognize these challenges and make moves to address them. It is designed to raise the performance of a doctoral school through close work with the doctoral committee, deans and research leaders (the leadership team), research supervisors, and candidates. Each phase is considered a performative act. Each act uses design methods to leverage the performativity of language, and the resulting speech acts gen-erate consequences.142 All but the last act involve capacity-building work-shops and convivial discussions. The workshops have a topic or theme, ex-plored with the three stakeholder groups, together or in tandem, and result in tasks to be implemented and discussed in future acts. The discussions complement the workshops: small meetings that afford mentoring for indi-viduals and study or research groups. This multi-pronged approach allows trickle-up and trickle-down of knowledge; it recognizes current approaches; supports existing strengths; creates space to respond to struggles; and paves the road to higher quality overall. The plan, as a whole, results in: evaluation guidelines; a framework for ongoing systemic change; and a series of actions to position the institution as a research leadership node, connecting art and design universities regionally and internationally. The six acts build on each other over an academic year. Much of the work is group work, designed to stimulate participation and active learning. Rather than being silos of familiarity, groups are designed to afford cross-fertilization of disciplines and approaches, and cut across levels of research expertise. They provide a critical framework through which to engage with texts, theories, practices, and positions diffractively. They thus value and provide space for difference. As Karen Barad elaborates,143 building on Haraway,144 diffractive reading maps interference, rather than replication, reflection, or reproduction. It implies the possibility of diver-gent perspectives on the same material. It thus affords space to account for different disciplinary perspectives, practices, and values. It better positions researchers to challenge their assumptions and embrace other perspectives, and affords rapid and easy identification of research opportunities. Impor-tantly, diffraction posits situatedness as a methodology and an ethics, and creates space for an ethics of care.145 The ethical turn in design is relatively new146 and must advance beyond the procedural moves required by the academy, to deep reflection on the practice of design, as well as the practice of the everyday.147 Figure 4 illustrates the work plan process, and Table 3 unpacks each act into concrete actions.148she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020193:sksaT.kcabdeeflacitircotdnopserdnareviledot.semehthcraeseR:t4cA>>stnedutsignppuqeiingeB.yticapachcirneotffatsl.snaphcraeseR:t3cA>>.semehthcraeseR:t2cA>>it.secneepmoc)sevitcepsrepthobmorf(iphsnoitlaerrosivrepusehT.stnedutsdnaffatsyrosivrepus,ymedacaehtfoylltauumebnactiosltyeairporppatilednahdnadnalaittneopdesilaernulebisivekamotsievitjceboyrosivrepusehtotsllitkseercnocrevileD.liacfieneb:sksaT.noitnettatnegrudeentahtsaerateucadnfisecitcarP&sdohteMyranilpicsid-tsoP5TCAnilyevitceffeegagneotwohdnatsrednU:mAiiphsnoitlaeRrosivrepuS-etaddnaCehTinIgnisucoF3TCAfosessenkaewdnatshgnertsehtdnatsrednU:mAifOmaerDeWtahWdnaevaHeWtahW1TCAyranililpcsid-tsoppoeveddnahcraeserevitaroballoct-eaddnaciehtegarevelotwohdnatsrednU:mAisnoitartsurfdnaserisedehtdnamargorptnerruceht!snoitadnemmocermorFtfarDevitaroballoCsecitcarpsecitcarp&sdohtemyrandeppatnUlaitnetopltnempoevederutufpamdaorAoTrofmoceA C T  6  rlipcidisACT 5 post-e  c a n d i d a te-supervisor relationshipnapllanosrepehTrosivrepus-etaddnaCiisphsnoitlaernoisivrepuSgnirotnem&desab-ecitcarPsegnellahc:hcraeserseitinutroppo&hcraeseRpohskrowhcraeseRsemehtlarotcoDlmuucirrucg in                t hnisucof3TCAm ofare dewtahw&evahewtahwT 1CAhcraeseRsasnoitcatuptuoylraohcsl&gnitropeRpugnitirw?ignpoeveDlairetircnoitlauavelmuucirruclarotcoDlsebareviledignhsilbuPhcraeserruoygndiliuBspuorghcraesersemehThcraeseRisetaddnaClarotcoDimaeTphsredaeLsrosivrepuSgninnalpdrawrons & fm endatiotuptuolarutluc&cfintiA CT 4 scieytinummocgniduilACT 2 btxenehtnapldnasnoitadnemmocerrevileD:mAiignhsilbuP&noitlauavElignnnaPdrawroF&snoitadnemmoceR6TCAttupuOlarutluC&cfiitneicS4TCAhcraesericgeartstlpoeveddnayfitnedI:mAiytinummoCgndiliuB2TCAotloohcsehtrofsievitjceboehT.loohcsehtrofspetsdnacitsitrarofairetircnoitlauavelpoeveD:mAidnuorasdeent‘seaddnacidnatsrednu;snoitceridsloohcsngisedfokrowentaniedonaemocebwohdnatsrednu;sehcaorppadesab-ecitcarpwohteartsnomeddna,semehthcraeserigngreme.yticapachcraeserriehtgnisiarotdettimmocylralimisgnitirwdnatnempoevedlyroeht,ecitcarpevitaerctnegrevdriofsucoltgnirehagasaevresyamsemehtfoecnatropmieht;evitroppusylltauumebnac:t3cA>>:sksaT.icofhcraeserevitaercdnacitsitranwarD.loohcsngised.lehcstiRsamohTybaniyticapachcraesixSnilnaPkroWA-ergndiliuB:stcA4erugiF.hcnualcilbuprofydaer;yllanrentil.srapmexegniripsnI.semehthcraeseR:t5cA>>tdevorppa—nempoevedleruutfrofpamdaoR:sksaT.tcapmilanoitanrentievitceffelebarevileDlanFi—hcraeserpugnitirwdnagnitroper;gnnoiitisop&ygeartstnoitacilbuP:t4cA>>.semehthcraeseRellienaDyb0202©ignvehcai.)weverilanrentirof(noitacilbuptfarD.edliWWilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns                                                                                                                                                                      194Table 3 A Work Plan in Six Acts: Transforming doctoral training and building research capacity in a design school.

Advanced Studio Course in Aalto University’s Creative Sustainability Master’s Programme,” DFG, accessed April 26, 2020, http://dfg-course.aalto.fi/.The grand challenge of design education appears to be twofold: 1) equip designers to innovate transformatively; and 2) ensure actors across society recognize the potential of design — beyond material and interaction aes-thetics — so that designers may leverage their world-making skills towards profound and meaningful impact. My focus in this section is predominantly on the first challenge. In Table 4, I collate the takeaways from my argu-ment into a list of skills and competencies I believe are needed by design researchers if they are to contribute to global challenges constructively. This list — developed over several years, in diverse educational contexts — is a work in progress and is far from refined. My intention with this formal pre-sentation is to invite discussion, reflection, and debate, so that as a commu-nity, we might consider my recommendations diffractively: from a variety of perspectives, highlighting difference rather than similarity, to arrive at a more pluralistic understanding of what is needed.If we are to respond constructively to global challenges, people must be empowered to act. To collectively anticipate alternatives; shift the beliefs, attitudes, values and systems that guide, shape, and constrain our behav-iors; and ultimately reorient cultures from a strong focus on consumption towards regeneration, and thereby interdependent personal, societal, and more-than-human — planetary — flourishing. Doing so may indeed re-quire what Daniel Hausknost calls “creative destruction.” As he argues in his address to the UN Sustainable Development Transformation Forum, achieving “a purposive and time-bound transformation entails non-linear, disruptive and by definition unpredictable forms of change and … political institutions with the capacity, power, and legitimacy to make transformative decisions.”149 I propose that design research has an important role to play within this process. However, equipping designers to respond to problems of this magnitude remains a critical challenge.150 Light and colleagues, in bringing focus to creative practice, make a strong move in response to this challenge.151 Aalto University’s Design for Government course makes an-other strong move.152 Other institutions are making advances. More work is needed. We must educate our students to reflect on the social and environmental impact of their design activities — the materials and processes they use; the artefacts and systems they create; the ways they engage with human and non-human stakeholders. We must teach them to consider how their actions impact our performance in relation to the social and planetary boundaries, and whether they position us within the safe and just operating space, described above. Our understanding of these benchmarks must be context-sensitive and continually evolving, as we empower the marginalized and respond to the particular within a global ecosystem. Design must be participatory; sensitive to first-person perspective, situated experience; and account for a plurality of voices. This move alone will go far in helping to transform design education, and make it fit for twenty-first-century con-cerns. The skills in Table 4 will further assist this process. They represent the takeaways pulled from the text above.Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns198Table 4 Draft recommendations: skills design researchers need to grapple with global challenges.Skills and capacities needed by design researchers to grapple with global challenges:• Skill in post-disciplinary practice.• The ability to think and discuss design beyond the discipline itself;

We need transfor-mative change — the kind highlighted last year in the IPBES Global Assess-ment Report (the one that found a million species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction in coming decades): fundamental, system-wide reorganiza-tion across technological, economic and social factors, including paradigms, goals and values, promoting social and environmental responsibilities across all sectors. As daunting and costly as this may sound — it pales in comparison to the price we are already paying.”153 Following, on May 10, 2020, in a letter to the Guardian newspaper enti-tled “After Coronavirus, Focus on the Climate Emergency,” twelve leading climate scientists bluntly deliver their expert opinion. “It is time to ac-knowledge our collective failure to respond to climate change, identify its consequences, and accept the massive personal, local, national, and global adaptation that awaits us all.”154 Jørgen Randers, a co-author of The Limits to Growth, its 1992 and 2004 sequels, and author (in 2012) of 2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years,155 explains that we know what the problem is — climate change, short term thinking, an extractive relationship to the earth’s ecosystem, and slow-moving mechanisms of governance — and we know what the solutions are.156 The challenge is implementation. We need to convince people to think in the long(er) term, and make it profit-able (I suggest beneficial writ large) to do the right thing, and we need a system that is capable of making big decisions quickly.157 In response, Birger Sevaldson reminds us all that most “established sciences are ‘sciences of what is.’ Design has the potential to be the science of what ought to be.”158 Global challenges are vast and complex, and they play out very differ-ently in different places and for different actors. They are further compli-cated by cause and effect being difficult to correlate empirically, let alone perceptually — the timescales of planetary change can be very different from those of human experience. COVID-19 is not more or less complex than other global challenges, but has created a more immediate and instanta-neous need to transform how we work, socialize, manage healthcare, and deliver education. It is also demonstrating our capacity for rapid, radical change. I hope our education systems might learn from this example. Faced with the complications of COVID-19, students are deferring or cancelling planned study. Education and research financing models are in question.159 In many places, restructuring has begun. Perhaps the dramatic and drastic situation of COVID-19 is the opportunity we need, to (re)consider and trans-form our educational structures? As we rebuild society, might we rethink what design research education is, to better account for global challenges?Being a designer means being an optimist — to be designers, we must make proposals, and we base these proposals on the opportunities we Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns200160 Manzini, “New Design Knowledge,” 4.161 Ibid., 8–9, emphasis in original.162 See Note 69.163 Waag, “BioHack Academy: BioFactory,” Waag technology and society, accessed May 11, 2020, https://waag.org/en/project/biohack-academy-biofactory.meet.160 Global challenges are nothing if not an opportunity for design. As Manzini explains,161 “There is [at the time, emerging, now urgent] demand for sustainable solutions and for visions of sustainability.” Feasible alter-natives indicate new qualities, such as the quality of places, communities, commons, and time. In every country in the world there are cases of social, technological, and material innovation that could be seen as significant steps towards sustainability.162 But they do not always easily scale or map well to other circumstances. There is much to do and to learn for designers and design. However, design research education must transform if it is to equip designers to constructively respond.In this article, I make a case for praxis — research in action — that can assist this transformation. I propose participatory research through design as a foundational methodology; four pillars to enable undergraduate and mas-ter’s students to develop sophisticated design research; a work plan to build capacity in a doctoral school; and a list of skills and capacities that design re-searchers will need if they are to respond constructively to global challenges. This list will never be exhaustive. Nonetheless, it provides concrete require-ments to which design schools and universities can respond. Planting these seeds does not require new programs. The methodology, pillars of practice, and many of the skills can be inserted into existing undergraduate and mas-ter’s curricula. The content of courses may have to change — perhaps radi-cally in some cases — to ensure, for example, that skills in biodesign become commonplace. Or that students develop their capacities for engaging with scientists, negotiating relationships with diverse civil and civic society actors, making visible tension points, and fast-tracking transformative innovation. At SDU (The University of Southern Denmark, Kolding campus) I devel-oped our capacities in biodesign with a modest investment, a lot of good will, a partnership with a local biologist, and three formal mechanisms. These were Waag Technology and Society’s Biohack Academy;163 a flexible 10ECTS teaching module (IT Product Design Professional Research Ap-prenticeship); and the coordinated, distributed public events connected to Danish National Research Week (Forskningens Døgn). These mechanisms enabled me to gather and build equipment, skills, and community, and strengthen collaboration within the university and with diverse local, re-gional, and international actors from civil and civic society. These actors, today, collectively sustain interest in the idea of situated biohacking, in Kolding and beyond; and this new capacity laid a foundation for new re-search, partners, and revenue streams. Investment to make similar changes in another institution could also be approached iteratively and creatively, with significant impact. Whatever the capacities of the institution, teaching staff must be supported to develop experience and skills; afforded flexibility (and a certain amount of autonomy) when determining the content of their courses; and provided a budget for equipment, as possible, where needed. They must also be encouraged — not only with words, but with seed funding and workload redistribution where needed — so they can identify opportu-nities and build community in partnership with diverse civil and civic society stakeholders, including individuals, organizations and community groups that have enthusiasm and experience in the targeted domains.she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020201164 Eduardo Mendieta, “Philosophy of Liberation,” in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Edward N. Zalta (Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University, 2016), available at https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/liberation/; drawing on: Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed; Paulo Freire, Education for Critical Consciousness, vol. 1 (London: Continuum, 1974).165 Manzini, “New Design Knowledge,” 6.Building research capacity at the doctoral level is perhaps not so dif-ferent than at the undergrad level. It requires iterative surgery. The work plan I describe above is designed to intervene in an existing program: six performative acts in which an external facilitator works with the leadership team, supervisors, and current cohort of candidates. Through a guided process, these actors collectively diagnose and respond to existing strengths and weaknesses; build research and supervision capacities; and develop a roadmap to ensure ongoing impact. Implementing this work plan requires a commitment of resources — time, money, and effort. Many art and design institutions struggle to build their capacity, for a range of reasons. They al-ready commit resources, either directly or indirectly, in trying to address this issue. The work plan will help them to (re)focus their efforts, and be more effective in this endeavor. It will lead to more robust supervision, research training, and practice, to the benefit of the candidates, the supervisors, the institution itself, and the broader research community.Educational institutions are not famously flexible, but we live in curious times. The need to transform how we live, and the underlying philosophies that guide decision making and action in much of the world, cannot reason-ably be disputed. Design, and thus design research education has an obliga-tion to respond — just as we are part of the problem, we must, humbly and mindfully, be part of the transformation. As Brazilian educator Paulo Freire explains, if people are to overcome their dependence, they can only do so through their own agency, by becoming the subject of their own liberation. To become a subject of one’s own liberation means to engage in a process of conscientização, or consciousness raising, through a pedagogy that rejects the notion of the learner as a passive receptacle and instead departs from the fundamental realization that learning is a dynamic process. Two key notions of Freire’s pedagogical theory are that (1) teaching requires listening to the people; and (2) schooling means life, that is, learning is both indispensable to life and it takes place in the midst of living.164 I propose design research, similarly, requires listening to the people, and as a praxis, is indispensable to life and takes place in the midst of living. In the first half of this article, I raised the idea of designers as sustain-ability brokers. In 2008, Manzini suggested that if designers want to work as agents for sustainability, they need to better understand the contexts in which they are operating. He said that they must also understand change in progress, as well as how to re-orient that change towards sustainability. This is not easy. It requires generating system transformations such that “all social actors use new ways of thinking and acting with totally new artifacts, organizational forms and networks…. Designers, too, must rethink them-selves, rethink how they operate and reshape their position in society.”165The steps I propose here — the seeds I have planted — are designed to empower design research educators, and thence design researchers, to facili-tate this process. To empower people, including themselves, to be the archi-tects of our reconnection with nature and eventual whole-of-system flour-ishing. The objective in committing these ideas to print is to invite others to join me in asking what we might grow as we reflect on what designers and design researchers might rightfully expect from the academy if they are to Wilde: Design Research Education and Global Concerns202166 Manzini, Design, When Everybody Designs.167 Karen Hao, “Live-Streaming Helped China’s Farmers Survive the Pandemic.

The aim is to equip designer researchers to assist in the building of bridges; to con-nect the desires, fears, and interests of everyday designers166 and the latest scientific knowledge; and to facilitate a two-stage transformative innovation process. This entails 1) developing “anticipatory future imaginaries,” and 2) backcasting to implementable nows and, through a collective, rigorous, and creative resourcing process, implement transformative innovation. The resulting innovations may be modest — novel applications of existing tech-nologies, such as an app that connects farmers in rural China with people in the city, for meaningful exchange as well as commerce.167 Or they may be technologically sophisticated, such as a custom technology set-up that enables an entrepreneur to grow vanilla beans locally and sustainably, with a small footprint, and control the system from his phone instead of traveling to politically unstable, remote locations in another country at considerable expense and personal risk to procure them.168 Or they may be materially and relationally sophisticated, as they are at BlueCity169 — a platform and accelerator for circular entrepreneurs situated in Tropicana, a former sub-tropical swimming oasis, complete with slides and hot tubs. At BlueCity, a restaurant’s coffee waste is used by two co-located businesses to grow mushrooms (some of which go back to the restaurant) and mycelium for packaging materials; fruit waste from the port is turned into strong leather like material for bags and books; a slow fashion label recycles car and bicycle tires into accessories, with people who have a distance to the labor market; and another business turns corporate waste streams into consumer prod-ucts. Any combination of the above might work.170 What is important is that they make a profound difference. Participatory research through design and the four pillars of practice support grounded planning, (re)configuring the research as it unfolds. Together, they ensure robust research decision making, and contextually rel-evant research outcomes. The work plan, in complement, bolsters the efforts of supervisors, doctoral candidates, and the leadership team, and focuses curriculum development to the benefit of all. The six acts that make up the work plan involve capacity-building workshops and convivial discussions, where “coffee and cake” combine with constructive critique. These activities are meant to be convivial — friendly, at times lively — and involve com-mensality. Commensality is the practice of eating together, leveraging the social and sensory aspects of food, as well as the nutritive. The inclusion of commensality reflects the need to maintain joy, in our determination, as we grapple with challenges large and small. This need is not specific to research into food systems. It is crucial to any topic of twenty-first-century complex design research.Equipping design researchers to respond to global challenges is one of four challenges for design education identified by Friedman.171 The others — performance challenges, systemic challenges, and contextual challenges — do not sit apart, but are currently better served by design education.172 The moves I propose here respond to that gap. Through them, I hope to meaningfully contribute to a constructive transformation of design research education from within, and in doing so, seed regenerative futures she ji The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation Vol. 6, No. 2, Summer 2020203for the discipline. The overarching objective is to support civil and civic society actors — including designers, design researchers, and educators — to reorient our actions towards the environment and care more for our more-than-human selves, loved ones, and diverse fellow travelers; and to enhance our capacities for human-nature relatedness. I believe that doing so will assist us in developing the resilience we need to participate in our communi-ties and ecosystems more constructively. I find this vision of constructive participation in community particu-larly compelling as I sit in my glassed-in-balcony-cum-office, with a heater, a blanket, and a beach hat to shade my eyes, and closed in by lockdown, acutely aware of my privilege — feeling relatively safe (if extremely trou-bled) during the COVID-19 pandemic. I see the upset around me, and dare to hope it may finally serve as the impetus we need to take meaningful, broad-reaching, locally situated, planetary scale, action. In any case, I hope the seeds I plant here bear fruit and grow.AcknowledgmentsI extend my heartfelt gratitude to the reviewers for their generous engage-ment with my clumsy draft manuscript.
