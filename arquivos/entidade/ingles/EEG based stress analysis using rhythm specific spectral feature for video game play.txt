Inrecent years, the rise of video gameplay is unprecedented, further triggered by the lock-down imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers and organizations havecontributed to the practical analysis of the impacts of such extended periods of gameplay,which lacks coordinated studies to underline the outcomes and reflect those in future gamedesigning and public awareness about video gameplay. Investigations have mostly focusedon the “gameplay stress” based on physical syndromes only. Some studies have analyzedthe effects of video gameplay with EEG, MRI, etc., without concentrating on the relaxationprocedure after video gameplay.MethodsThis paper presents an end-to-end stress analysis for video gaming stimuli using EEG.The PSD value of the Alpha and Beta bands is computed to calculate the Beta-to-Alpharatio (BAR). In this article, BAR is used to denote mental stress. Subjects are chosen basedon various factors such as gender, gameplay experience, age, and BMI. EEG is recorded usingScan SynAmps2 Express equipment. There are three types of video gameplay: strategic,puzzle, and combinational. Relaxation is accomplished in this study by the use of music ofvarious pitches. Two types of regression analysis is done to mathematically model stress and1   relaxation curve. Brain topography is rendered to indicate the stressed and relaxed regionof the brain.ResultsIn the relaxed state, the subjects have BAR 0.701, which is considered the baseline value.Non-gamer subjects have an average BAR of 2.403 for 1 hour of strategic video gameplay,whereas gamers have 2.218 BAR concurrently. After 12 minutes of listening to low-pitchmusic, gamers achieved 0.709 BAR, which is nearly the baseline value. In comparison toQuartic regression, the 4P L symmetrical sigmoid function performs regression analysis withfewer parameters and computational power.ConclusionNon-gamers experience more stress than gamers, whereas strategic game creates morestress on human brain. During gameplay, the beta band in the frontal region is mostlyactivated. For relaxation, low pitch music is the most useful media. Residual stress is evi-dent in the frontal lobe when the subjects experienced high pitch music. Quartic regressionperforms regression analysis follow the relaxation curve more accurately compared to 4PLsymmetrical sigmoid function.Keywords: Beta-Alpha ratio, EEG, Stress - relaxation modeling, Topography, Videogameplay.1. IntroductionIn the modern society, stress is a significant matter of concern. According to WHO,loss of productivity and mental health disorders have globally cost a significant capital[19]. When the human body is exposed to negative stimuli, it responds with stress. Acutestress is the result of short-term stressful events, which are typically indicated by transient∗Corresponding authorEmail addresses: swapno15roy@gmail.com (Shidhartho Roy ID ), monira@eee.kuet.ac.bd (MoniraIslam ), suyusuf@eee.kuet.ac.bd (Md.

Acute stress lasting for a long time might turn into episodic stress.Chronic stress, anxiety, and clinical depression can result from prolonged exposure to stressfactors or traumatic situations [21]. This paper mainly centers around acute stress. Tostudy acute stress, video gameplay has been employed as the stimulus.Video games (VG) are becoming increasingly popular among young people in currentculture, and VG are growing in popularity not just as a research tool but also as an areaof study.In addition, a plenty of research is focused on the neurological and behavioralconsequences of VG because of the expanding popularity and universal applications, offeringa comprehensive brain correlation in recent decades. Moreover, the rising diversity of digitaltechnology, such as smartphones and tablets, has brought entertainment software or VGinto the mainstream. Thus, a significant portion of society (more than 30% in tablets and70% in smartphones) is exposed to these technologies and may now, in some way, be termedas casual gamers [8].Because of its high temporal resolution, non-invasiveness, and low cost, electroencephalog-raphy (EEG) is frequently utilized in research, including neural engineering, neuroscience,and biomedical engineering (e.g., brain-computer interfaces, BCI [10], sleep analysis [18],stress analysis [32], and seizure detection [7]). EEG has provided insight into the brain’sfunctioning in many cognitive processes and is regarded as the building block of functionalsignaling in the brain. Oscillations of various frequencies are linked to various cognitivefunctions. Alpha oscillations, for example, are linked to relaxation, whereas beta rhythmsare linked to tension.When it comes to relaxation, listening to music is unquestionably a top contender. Musichas a powerful impact on both the mind and the body. Faster music can help us to con-centrate and feel more alert. Upbeat music can boost one’s mood and make one feel moreoptimistic about life. A slower tempo can relax the mind and muscles, making a person feelsoothed while letting go of the day’s stress. This study uses three different types of music(low, medium, and high pitch) to study relaxation.In the mainstream media, both good and bad health claims associated with VG arecommon. These comments are primarily unconfirmed and sensational, based on ’expert’3opinions, but without proof. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to know theactual impacts of long-term exposure to video gaming in a deeper technical context. Theeffect can be positive in the form of cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social benefits[33] or can be negative in the form of exposure to graphic violence, addiction, contribution toobesity, and cardiometabolism [13]. For a long time, video gaming has been on the increase.However, the growth in gaming was unprecedented during the COVID pandemic. Accordingto a gamesindustry.biz study, VG sales have surged by 63 percent in 50 major areas sincepre-pandemic time [34]. The home quarantine compelled everyone to explore the worldof gaming, resulting in an 80% increase in the number of new games downloaded. Underthe pandemic, the social infrastructure for individuals, particularly those in quarantine, hasevolved into various platforms [15]. The rise of gameplay in recent years is evident fromFig. 1. In early 2020, when lockdown started, the duration of video gameplay in hours hasalmost doubled from before.Figure 1: The surge of gameplay hours watched since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, the gameplayhours watched have almost doubled [29].Some researchers have previously focused on the influence of VG, depending on par-ticipants’ exposure to that particular game or studies, on the content features of VG [14].Some research specializes in the genres of VG with prominent graphic violence (action, war,shooting, killing, etc.) On this basis, a reasonable quantity of scientific documentation on4the research of violence in VG and violence acclimatization is used [16]. For decades, social,political, and scientific considerations have been given to the link between exposure to me-dia violence and violent behavior. Extensive empirical data suggest that exposure to mediaviolence impacts aggressive behavior, abuse, violent cognition, physiologic excitement, andteenage animosity [30]. Another study has shown that playing some VG, particularly ”ac-tion” games, often improves the cognitive function [16]. It has also given thought on howthe business may be better regulated to promote games for cognitive advancement. Consid-erable research has been conducted on the stressful effects of video gaming on the humanbrain [12]. Using EEG as a tool for study, Soysal et al. distinguished the function of thebrain for different games and the stress level caused by them. It can differentiate betweena relaxed and a stressed individual [26]. Saputra et al. researched a crucial aspect of videogaming and found that, in addition to the entertainment value of video gaming, players getstressed when they experience frustration as a result of virtual failure [24].Figure 2: Paper organization structure.Despite these researches, relatively few works are based on relaxing the stress causedby video gaming. The motivation behind this study was to resemble real-world scenariosas EEG stimuli and analyze video gameplay with EEG. For this purpose, we conducted anopen survey on the nature of video gaming on various people. Among 214 participants,41.35% indicated they do not do anything after gaming, while 38.67% stated they like somemusic after a prolonged gaming period. Because these two populations outnumber others,5AbstractI. IntroductionII. Literature reviewIII. MethodologyV. OutcomesVI. ConclusionRelaxation analysisIV.

To select the video gaming period, we asked our participantshow long they play at a time. On average, they reported that they play 55.6 minutes ofVG. Some gamers also documented that they play 3 to 4 hours at a stretch, and this hasbeen considered as outlier in this study. The relaxation period of 12 minutes is also basedon the survey. Subjects were asked to choose how long they want to spend time after videogameplay before starting another cognitive intensive work. The average response time was11.08 minutes.6[25][1][32][22]Furthermore, a few studies have been discovered to develop a mathematical model basedon stress development from gaming and the relaxation via music of various pitches. Ourgoal in this study is mental state analysis during gameplay of various game genres, brainmapping of these states, mental state analysis after playtime, relaxing via multiple forms ofmusic, and corresponding regression analysis. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the firstattempt to aggregate all of them 1. The rest of the paper is organized as shown in Fig. 2.2. Literature ReviewFrom the very beginning of the research to examine the response of the brain due tovideo gameplay, the effects of video gameplay using EEG has been emphasized. Previouslysome of the studies have been focused on other techniques rather than EEG. But EEG hadgood accuracy in examining brain activity for video game playing. From 2017 to 2021, manydevelopments took place in this era, such as using fMRI, MRI, PPG, GSR, fNIRS, ECG, etc.But accuracy was not good compared to EEG. Though ECG is the technique that is usedthe second-highest for this purpose, it is actually a low-quality method. Furthermore, it isdifficult to eliminate noise with conventional filtering methods for fNIRS. From the table 1below, it is clear that the EEG technique is best suited for examining the stress analysis indifferent time duration.Figure 3: Block diagram of this experiment.1After acceptance, code and dataset will be made open access for further research in the link: https://github.com/royShidhartho/Stress-analysis-video-gameplay7Subject preparationData acquisitionEEG preprocessingFeature extractionPower ratioEEG topographyRelaxation with musicGameplayRegression analysisAnother assessment observed from the literature review is that people aged 19 to 24 yearsare mostly impacted by video gaming. This circumstance has both positive and negativeimpacts on society. Though video gameplay can improve problem-solving skills, it is time-consuming. We had also observed that old adults, as well as patients, are involved in playinggameplay. The peak age ranged from 19 to 24 years and with increasing age, the observationand the interest in video gaming becomes lower consequently.3. MethodologyTo achieve the objective of this experiment, several methods are used. Subjects werefirst prepared after settling on a data acquisition protocol using an EEG recording deviceEEG signal and pre-processing by both onboard and digital devices. The power ratio wascomputed after extracting features from the clean EEG signal. This experiment made use ofa variety of games and music. Following the experiment, brain mapping was created usingthe EEG topography approach, and mathematical modeling was completed using regressionanalysis. Fig. 3 illustrates the block diagram of this experiment.3.1. Subject PreparationFour focus groups are organized for this study (F G1 – F G4) and from four to 17 each(N = 45). Participants were selected using an open survey procedure based on their expe-rience in gaming and their health condition. All subjects are between the ages of 20 and 24years (22.29 on average) and university students. These are organized into four focus groups:two groups are called ’Gamers’ who on average play games 10 hours a week or more. Theother two groups play games for less than 2 hour per week or do not play at all. Both menand women participated in the gamer and non-gamer groups. The proportion of women innon-gamers is 45.83%, compared to 19.04% in gamers. There is also a lack of sleep disordersor other serious disorders in the selected subjects. Furthermore, the subjects were unawareof the study’s goals. In figure 4, the subject distribution is depicted. Another criteria forselecting the subjects was to select them from a wide BMI spectrum. Eight of the subjectsin this study are obese (BMI 30.0 and above), 18 of them are overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9),812 of them are normal (BMI 18.5-24.9), and the rest of them, 7, are underweight (belowBMI 18.5).Figure 4: Subject distribution of this study. Blue shades denote the male subjects, and pink shade embodiesthe female subjects.3.2. Stimuli preparationVG is used as stimuli to create stress in this study. Based on game design, all VG weredivided into three groups. On one end of the scale, puzzle games demand quick thinking,whereas strategy games need quick response and extended pondering.1. Puzzle: Video puzzle games aim to solve riddles. Logic, pattern recognition, sequenceresolution, and word completion are only a few of the problem-solving capabilities thatthese puzzles might test for. The player may have endless time or endeavors to solvea puzzle or a time restriction, or it may make it more challenging to do fundamentalproblems by having to do it in real-time.Gameplay format: These games usually include rules in which players use a grid,network, or other interactive areas to control game pieces. In order to earn a triumph,the players must unravel clues so that they may then move to the next level. Usually,completing every riddle will lead to a more complicated task.92. Strategy: A video strategy game promotes strategic thinking and preparation towin. It focuses on strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical questions. In this area,there are additional action games. Many games also feature economic concerns andexploration. It is classified into four subtypes depending on whether the game is inturn or in real-time, whether strategic or tactical—for example, Rome: Total War,Dota 2, etc.Gameplay format: In order to reduce opposing troops, a player must perform a se-quence of operations against one or more opponents. Victory is achieved through agreater plan with less luck. The user receives a divine vision of the game world, withmost strategy VG offering them indirect authority over the game units. Consequently,most strategy games involve a mixture of tactical and strategic considerations andcontain various fighting components.3. Combinational:It accumulates both the puzzle and strategy type games. Such asGrand Theft Auto, San andreas etc.Gameplay format: A combination game implies a timed sequence of plays, each ofwhich leaves the opponent incapable or near impossible to block or otherwise preventthe next succession.Figure 5: Game classification considered for this study.103.3. EEG data AcquisitionThe Scan SynAmps2 Express equipment (Compumedics Ltd., VIC, Australia) was usedto acquire EEG signals. A wired EEG cap containing 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes, comprising30 EEG electrodes and two reference electrodes, was utilized to acquire EEG data (oppo-site lateral mastoids). An adapted international 10–20 system was used to put the EEGelectrodes. All electrodes and the skin had a contact impedance of less than 5 kΩ . TheEEG recordings were amplified and digitized at 500 Hz using the Scan SynAmps2 Expressdevice (resolution: 16 bits). Scan 4.5 from Neuroscan is the data collecting tool. On thecomputer, the raw data was stored as .cnt files. Figure 6 manifests the the experimentelectrode positions.Figure 6: 10-20 system of electrode placement. Blue electrode denotes the electrode positions used in thisexperiment.The acquisition of data is divided into two streams – one during video gameplay and onefollowing gameplay. In the gameplay stage, the relaxed state value was captured initiallyafter 10 minutes of relaxation in experimental set-up data. The data was collected during11F8Fp2F7FzF4CzC4T4C3T5P3PzP4T6O2O1Fp1F3NasionT3A1A2FT7FC3FCzFC4FT8TP7CP3CPzCP4TP8Ozthe games in an interval of 15 minutes. Data were recorded after the gameplay within aperiod of 3 minutes. The workflow of data gathering for the experiment is displayed in theFig. 7 .Figure 7: Data acquisition protocol. The orange color palette denotes the during gameplay phase, and thegreen color palette represents after gameplay phase.3.4. Feature extractionThe FFT is a sophisticated reversible mapping technique used to transfer a signal from atime domain to a frequency domain. In the periodogram calculated by the FFT technique,the PSD properties of artifact-free EEG data may be evaluated. However, there is elevatedvolatility and low statistical precision in the periodogram. Welch developed a modifiedperiodogram averaging approach, resulting in a reduction in PSD variance [31].This process involves splitting time series data into segments, overlapping them, andthen conducting FFT, calculating and averaging the amplitude of each segment.In thisstudy, 72 minutes EEG signals were selected as samples, and the window length of each10 seconds was divided into four equal segments. The time sequence was separated into50% for each sample of 10 seconds, and four segments were overlapped. For each segment,12Relaxed state valueAfter 15 min. of gameplayAfter 30 min. of gameplayAfter 45 min. of gameplayAfter 60 min. of gameplayAfter 3 min. of relaxationAfter 6 min. of relaxationAfter 9 min. of relaxationAfter 12 min. of relaxationFFT was used to calculate and average the capacity of the overlapping FFT coefficients inall segments. This calculation is done for all frequency ranges until, ultimately, the Alphaand Beta PSD (µV 2/Hz) values have been generated. The PSD is manifested according toWelch in the following equation:Pd(f ) =1M UM −1(cid:88)n=0(cid:12)xd(n)w(n)e−j2πf n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2,(1)for d = 1, 2, 3, ..., L signal intervals, xd(n) is the sequence, where M is the intervallength. w(n) represents the window data, whereas U is the normalization factor for windowpower. U is defined as [27],U =1MM −1(cid:88)n=0|w(n)|2 .(2)The Welch spectrum of power can be shown as the mean over these modified peri-odograms:PW elch(f ) =1LL−1(cid:88)i=0Pd(f ),(3)where PW elch is each interval’s periodogram of the EEG signal.Rhythm power ratio The power ratio was calculated by dividing the absolute powerof one frequency band by the absolute power of another frequency band, using the averagedPSD of each frequency band. Delta activity revealed the deep resting condition of a person.It was not presumed to display substantial activity in the face of stress, which is why thisrhythm has not been studied. By dividing the PSD of beta by the PSD of alpha, thebeta/alpha rhythm power ratio was determined. After that, it was evaluated with the ratiovalue of the difference between the baseline and the stress session. The processes can alsobe used to determine the Theta/Beta ratio and differentiate between relaxed and stressedstates.The path of data collecting, signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and power ratiocomputation is depicted in Figure 3.133.4.1. EEG topographyEEG topography is a sort of neuroimage including the geometrical design of uniformlyspaced sites of multiple EEG electrodes on the head. A certain computer software mapsthe activity on the color screen or printer in many tones of colors by sorting the number ofactions (for example, blue might represent low EEG amplitude, while yellow and red mightrepresent larger amplitudes). From EEG topography, we are exploring the residual stresson the human brain. Residual stress is termed as the remaining stress after the designedrelaxation period for this study.In mathematical interpolation techniques (calculation of intermediate values on the val-ues of their neighbors), the spatial locations between electrodes are established to provide asmooth color gradation. This technique delivers the position of rhythm, amplitude changesregarding the skull surface, and a considerably more precise and realistic image.Comparing topographies for pattern similarity in various settings can demonstrate var-ious thinking processes and so directly test cognitive theories. Topographic analysis ofvariance (TANOVA) is a statistical test that examines similarity topographies. In this to-pographic similarity measure, called ”angle measure,” the topographical pattern similarityis measured by a high dimensional angle between two topographies.Multivariate topography patterns across all sensors are displayed as (cid:126)A and (cid:126)B vectorswith a size equal to that of the two situations. The following equation (Eq. 4) calculates anangle cosine of θ to quantify the topographical similitude between the two scenarios.(cid:126)A. (cid:126)B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:126)B(cid:126)A(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .(cid:12)The cosine value is an index that shows the spatial correlation between two circumstancescos θ =(4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),in which the +1 value indicates the same patterns as the -1 value. In addition, because themagnitude of the response in the two circumstances normalizes this index, it benefits thatthe magnitude of the responses does not impact it.3.4.2. Regression analysis and metricsTwo types of regression analysis is employed in this paper.14Figure 8: Symmetrical sigmoid function.• 4PL Symmetrical sigmoid function This results in a more advanced model thatis better suited to many biological processes. The four-parameter logistic regression isknown as this model (4PL). It is very beneficial for dose-response or receptor bindingtests or comparative tests.It contains four parameters to be evaluated to ’fit thecurve,’ as the name suggests. The model is designed for data making an S-shapedcurve. The model’s equation is:y = d +a − dc )b ,1 + ( x(5)where , a = the least value that can be achieved (i.e. what happens at relaxed state.), d= the highest value that can be achieved (i.e. what happens after 1 hour of gameplay),c = inflection point (i.e. the point on the S shaped curve halfway between a and d),and b = Hill’s slope of the curve (the steepness of the curve at point c).Fig. 8 denotes the structure of the 4PL Symmetrical sigmoid function.• Quartic Regression The quartic regression adapts to a data set with a quarticfunction (a polynomial function with a degree of 4). The form of quartic function is:15y = a + bx + cx2 + dx3 + ex4 + f x5(6)The quartic function takes a range of forms with various inflection points (when afunction changes form) and zero to many roots (places where the graph crosses theaxis). If the f value exceeds 0, three distinct fundamental forms can be present.Metrics Two types of regression metrics are employed here to fit the stress and relaxationcurve for this experiment.• Coefficient of determinationA statistical measure of how close the data are to the correct regression line is R-squared. It is also known as the determination coefficient or the multiple regressioncoefficients. A linear model may explain a certain proportion of the variation in aresponse variable:R2 = 1 −sum of the squares of residualstotal sum of squares(7)A high R2 number, in general, suggests that the model is a good fit for the data,though fit interpretations vary depending on the context of study. For example, a R2of 0.44 shows that 44 percent of the variation in the outcome can be explained simplyby predicting the outcome using the covariates in the model. In certain subjects, suchas the social sciences, that proportion may be difficult to forecast; in others, such asthe physical sciences, one would expect R2 to be considerably closer to 100%.• Akaike information criterion (AIC)The AIC is a prediction error estimator and a comparable quality for a certain numberof data models. AIC determines the quality of each model concerning each of the othermodels based on the collection of models for the data [17]. AIC offers a way to pickthe model. The information theory is the basis of AIC. When used to describe theprocess that produced the data, a statistic model is virtually never accurate; hence,16information is lost through the usage of the model to describe the process. The AICcalculates the amount of information lost by a particular model: the less informationlost, the greater the model’s quality [28].AIC = 2k − 2ln( ˆL),(8)where ˆL is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model and k is thenumber of estimated parameters in the model. AIC considers the trade-off betweenmodel goodness of fit and model simplicity when assessing the amount of informationlost by a model. To put it another way, AIC considers both the risks of overfittingand underfitting.3.5. Relaxation analysisMusic is used as a relaxation media in this study. Pitch has been used to categorizemusic in this research. Pitch is the characteristic that allows people to perceive sounds as”upper” or ”lower” in the sense of musical melodies. It is a perceptual feature of soundsthat allows them to be arranged on a frequency-related scale[1]. Only sounds with a preciseand stable frequency that can be differentiated from noise can calculate pitch. Pitch is asignificant auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.Pitch can be described as a frequency; however, it is a subjective psychoacoustical aspectof sound rather than a completely objective physical characteristic. Pitch has long been acritical topic in psychoacoustics, with theories of sound encoding, processing, and perceptionin the auditory system being created and tested. The frequency of vibration of the soundwaves that create them determines the pitch of sounds. A high pitch is defined as a frequencyof 880 hertz [Hz; cycles per second], while a low pitch is defined as a frequency of 55 hertz[Hz; cycles per second]. The music is divided into the following categories:• Low pitch music: below 200 Hz,• Medium pitch music: 200 to 600 Hz, and17• High pitch music: above 600 HzTo bring down the beta band activity in previous levels, subjects are divided into 4 groups.• Group 1: No music was introduced to bring down the brain activity to normal.• Group 2: Low pitch music was introduced to bring down the brain activity to normal.• Group 3: Medium pitch music was introduced to bring down the brain activity tonormal• Group 4: High pitch music was introduced to bring down the brain activity to normal.4. Experimental result analysisThe full experimental study is divided into three phases; stress level observation duringgaming, relaxation level determination after video gameplay and mathematical modelingof brain stress and relaxation. After discussing all the observations, the summary of thediscussion’s are pointed out in evaluation sub-section.4.1. Stress analysisBefore going into the gameplay and data acquisition, the relaxed state alpha and betavalue are measured. On average, the subjects exhibit BAR as 0.701 (Alpha = 4.329, Beta= 3.034). This value from now on is considered as the baseline value. When the gameplaystarts, subjects have gone through 3 distinct set of VG; puzzle, combinational, and strategic.As the subjects are broadly divided into 2 groups, gamer and non-gamer, each group’s dataare calculated in average. For data acquisition, 15 minutes interval is considered.Overall, in all categories of games, Strategic games are more stressful to subjects. Bycomparison of gamer and non-gamer, gamers are more likely to adopt strategic games. Inthe case of puzzle-type games, non-gamer people are more stressed than the gamer subjectgroup. The difference is also more significant here. As gamer group are more used to solvethe puzzle patterns it is less stressful to them. Same goes for strategic game also. But in thecase of strategic game the action / shooting scenes of games are almost have same impact18Table 2: Change of mental states during gameplay, observed with BAR.GameGamerAfterIncreaseAfterIncreaseAfterIncreaseAfter 1IncreaseTypestype15 min(%)30 min(%)45 min(%)PuzzleGamer0.7290.03840.8740.19791.2970.4595Non-Gamer0.8620.18680.9840.28761.5420.54541.8970.6305Hour1.541(%)0.5451Combi-Gamer0.8140.13880.9170.23561.3410.47731.7970.6099nationalNon-StrategicGamerGamerNon-Gamer1.0840.35331.2950.45871.7420.59762.1490.67381.1730.40241.3760.49061.8620.62352.2180.68391.3370.47571.4260.50841.8560.62232.4030.7083on both type of subjects. The difference is also been observed in the topographic plot ofbrain activity. In the topographic plot, the blue region indicates the dominance of alphaactivity and the red region denotes the dominance of beta activity. After only 15 minutes ofgameplay, the frontal lobe of non-gamers is indicating the dominance of beta band activity.This frontal lobe is directly connected with concentration, planning, and motor control.So, this topographic plot clearly indicates that non-gamers are more impacted with puzzlegameplay.Over the gameplay time, this trend is continued to grow. Also in the same time, thereis a medium hotspot of beta activity in the occipital lobe which is responsible for vision.This hotspot indicates the pressure increase in eyes for constant gameplay. And, also thisregion keeps growing over time. Another interesting phenomenon happens after 45 minutesof gameplay. The parietal lobe, responsible for body awareness, exhibits a mild hotspotconnecting the frontal and occipital lobe. All of these brain activities clearly indicate thatnon-gamers show a greater beta activity over gamers. As strategic type games create themaximum stress on subjects, so in case of topographic representation only subject reactionon strategic game is depicted in Fig. 9.19Figure 9: Topographic representation during gaming for strategic type gameplay. The blue color palettedenotes the dominance of alpha activity in that region.4.2. Music evoked relaxation analysis4.2.1. PuzzleIn puzzle-type gameplay, the after-gameplay BAR was 1.541 for gamers and 1.897 fornon-gamers. Among the four subject groups, the group exposed to low pitch music forrelaxation was more evident to bring down the beta band activity faster than the otherthree groups. Within this group, the beta activity in the frontal lobe and motor cortex wasdowned significantly faster than the other three groups. Another interesting phenomenonhappened in the group, which is not exposed to no music. Their response to the brainrelaxation process was just below the medium pitch song-exposed group. It is evident fromthe brain response that low pitch music relaxes the stressed brain faster than high pitchmusic. Also, at the same time, high music relaxes the brain at a much slower rate, and theresidual beta-band activity is highest among all three types of music. Another noticeablechange in brain activity is the creation of a mild hotspot in the temporal lobe. The changeof mental state for puzzle-type gameplay is shown in Table 3. The residual stress is evident20GamerNon-gamerAfter 15 minutesAfter 30 minutesAfter 45 minutesAfter 1 hourin the frontal lobe when the subjects experienced high pitch music.Table 3: Change of mental states after gameplay (puzzle), observed with BAR.MusicGamerImmediatelyAfter3After6After9After 12TypestypeAfterGamer1.541min1.023min0.865min0.812min0.709Non-Gamer1.8971.1370.9120.8560.716LowpitchMediumGamer1.5411.1480.8920.8410.714PitchNon-Gamer1.8971.2391.0260.9130.768HighpitchGamer1.5411.2670.9140.8620.736Non-Gamer1.8971.3421.1030.9240.784NoGamer1.5411.1860.8950.8520.7181.8971.2891.0780.9170.796musicNon-Gamer4.2.2. CombinationalFor combinational game types, the residual stress after 12 minutes of rest was more thanin puzzle-type gameplay. Table 4 documented the mental state change for relaxation aftercombinational type gameplay. The relaxation curve after combinational type gameplay isbetween the responses after puzzle and strategic type gameplay. The mild hotspots of thefrontal lobe are smaller than strategic type gameplay (Fig. 10). Another notable observationis when subjects were not experienced with any music. In this case, the response is almostsimilar to the medium pitch music response.21Table 4: Change of mental states after gameplay (combinational), observed with BAR.MusicGamerImmediatelyAfter3After6After9After 12TypestypeAfterGamer1.797min1.434min0.968min0.873min0.713Non-Gamer2.1491.6141.1720.8660.72LowpitchMediumGamer1.7971.3490.980.8510.718PitchNon-Gamer2.1491.6141.1720.9240.829HighpitchGamer1.7971.5421.0340.8720.820Non-Gamer2.1491.8241.1970.9350.805NoGamer1.7971.4790.9710.8070.7242.1491.6721.0940.8940.815musicNon-Gamer4.2.3. StrategicFor strategic type gameplay, low pitch music was helpful for both gamers and non-gamers. Another interesting observation is that for non-gamers, high pitch music and nomusic yields an almost similar response in the relaxation curve.In Fig. 10 the phasesof brain after 12 minutes for various cases are depicted in topographic representation. Amild hotspot of beta activity in the frontal lobe is present for non-gamers when they areexperienced to medium pitch music for relaxation. Nevertheless, the overall percentage ofbeta activity is much higher in non-gamers who experienced high pitch music. When gamershave not experienced any music, some mild activity zones are visible frontal and occipitallobes. Overall, both for gamers and non-gamers, low pitch music brings more relaxationthan any other relaxation procedure (Table 5).22Figure 10: Topographic representation after gaming for strategic type gameplay.

Regression based mathematical analysisFor the mathematical modelling of the entire experiment, two different phases have beenfollowed, such as:1. During gameplay: Tables 6 and 7 denote the parameters for 4PL symmetrical sig-moid function and quartic regression, respectively. R2 and AIC is used to measurethe goodness of the mathematical modeling for the respective equations. In the latergameplay period, stress increase rate was much higher than the earlier time.2. After gameplay: In Tables 8 and 9, the mathematical modeling for brain relaxationis documented. In the first three minutes the rate of relaxation is higher than the latersegments.In Fig. 12, the comparison between the two mathematical models is depicted. In almostall cases, the quartic regression dominates over the 4PL symmetrical sigmoid function. But24this achievement has come with a price for quartic regression. On average, 20-30% morecomputational power was required to model quartic regression than the 4PL symmetricalsigmoid function.Table 6: Parameters and metrics of mathematical modeling for during gameplay experiment (4PL symmet-rical sigmoid function).GameGamerCoefficientMetricstypetypeabcdR2AICPuzzleGamer0.71135.008241.05071.66530.9996-27.47NonGamer0.77014.514342.85312.14710.9887-8.195Combi-Gamer0.73713.154862.61043.01420.9943-12.68nationalNonGamer0.72231.1433700887940.9919-8.719StrategicGamer0.71870.9913240353390540.989-6.724NonGamer0.74720.9616290172460270.4 0.96050.3441The strategic game creates more stress on the subjects of the three broad categoriesof games discussed here. However, gamer subject groups adapted more to strategic gamesbecause of their experience.In the relaxation phase, the subject groups who experienced puzzle games achieved lessBAR than other groups. Even for non-gamers, this observation stands out. We concludethat even when subjects were not experienced to puzzle games, puzzles are commonplace inour lives. So, the brain seems to adapt too quickly.For mathematical modeling, during gameplay, the stress curve is very predictable, re-sulting in R2 value 1 for every case. However, when 4PL symmetrical sigmoid functionswere used to model relaxation curves, the R2 value drops to even 0.9913. Only in twocases, the R2 value attains 1. In quartic regression function, despite requiring much more25Table 7: Parameters and metrics of mathematical modeling for during gameplay experiment (quartic re-gression).GameGamerCoefficienttypetypeabcdeMetricsR2PuzzleGamer0.7010.01184-0.001365.373E-5-5.086E-7NonGamer0.7010.04116-0.0034110.598E-5-9.169E-7Combi-Gamer0.7010.02556-0.002026.227E-5-5.103E-7nationalNonGamer0.7010.05173-0.002687.081E-5-5.629E-7StrategicGamer0.7010.06878-0.003799.874E-5-7.942E-7NonGamer0.7010.0989-545410.000126-9.152E-7111111computational power, yields the R2 value to 1.5. Outcome of the StudyThe key outcome of the study is delineated as follows:1. Non-gamers experience more stress than gamers,2. During gameplay, the beta band in the frontal region is mostly activated,3. Strategic game creates more stress on human brain,4. Low pitch music is the most useful media for relaxation,5. Residual stress is evident in the frontal lobe when the subjects experienced high pitchmusic,6. During relaxation, the alpha band in the frontal region is mostly activated,7. 4PL symmetrical sigmoid function performs regression analysis with minimum param-eters/ computational power,26Figure 12: Residuals of cubic and original average dataTable 8: After gameplay mathematical modeling with 4PL symmetrical sigmoid function.Game type Music typeLow PitchGamertypeGamerNon GamerPuzzleCombi-nationalStrategicMediumGamerPitchNon GamerHigh PitchNo musicLow PitchGamerNon GamerGamerNon GamerGamerNon GamerMediumGamerPitchNon GamerHigh PitchNo musicLow PitchGamerNon GamerGamerNon GamerGamerNon GamerMediumGamerPitchNon GamerGamerHigh PitchNo musicCoefficienta1.54101.89701.54141.89701.54121.89691.54171.89691.79872.14841.79752.14861.79702.14871.79752.14902.21752.40242.21832.40222.2188b0.39370.49671.27290.790443.29040.82841.63800.47072.26731.46881.62541.72682.31981.70942.76642.52950.81971.10491.58531.24441.6827Non Gamer2.399616Gamer2.217533Non Gamer2.4004541.7547621.4266251.721276c360.909814.71214.27995.17633.48658.93883.9345922.32994.15145.80554.30454.39383.33994.40004.18413.91010.898617.24735.80479.58135.99977.5923237.8044797.344441d-2.4249-0.55700.51330.25160.8151-0.02150.6141-7.71680.64910.21790.53030.58750.77320.58870.67390.7385-0.7128-0.26890.2552-0.48170.27235950.03812683-0.064708110.09479044MetricsR20.99790.99730.99370.99990.99890.00090.991310.9940.99960.99840.99970.99990.99990.999710.99650.99880.99990.99950.99980.99850.99990.9989AIC-20.95-16.05-15.37-36.46-24.73-28.03-13.77-40.25-12.53-23.86-19.37-25.68-35.66-31-27.28-42.42-12.21-16.5-30.82-21.38-25.39-15.49-28.79-17.128.

This paper presents acomprehensive stress analysis for video gameplay from a wide range of perspectives. Stresswas analyzed from the rhythm-specific spectral feature, BAR, from EEG. Among all games,the strategic game proves to be the most stressful. Non-gamers exhibit more stress to videogameplay than gamers, demonstrating the adaptability of video gameplay with stress. Musicof various pitches was used to compare no music after the gameplay for relaxation analysis.After video gameplay, low pitch music proved to be the most effective media for relaxation.Regression analysis was used to represent relaxation and stress mathematically better. Themost effective function for this is quartic regression. EEG topography has been used toidentify the activation hotspot within the brain for a specific game or relaxation procedure.28During gameplay, the frontal region is particularly active. This work can be expanded toinclude other types of VG or even other stressful activities.In addition, any relaxationtechnique other than music can be used to normalize brain activity.AcknowledgementsNone.
