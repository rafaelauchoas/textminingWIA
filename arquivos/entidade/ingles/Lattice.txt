As a branch of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Discoveryprovides techniques with which computers can automatically find fundamental knowledgeand principles that are original and useful [10]. Therefore, a fundamental issue of thetheoretical aspect of Knowledge Discovery is to establish some suitable mathematicalmodels for conjectures, consequences and hypotheses. In a sense, the whole subject ofmathematical logic aims at studying various mathematical models of consequences (i.e.,reasoning). On the other hand, not too much attention has been paid to conjecturesand hypotheses in the community of mathematical logic. Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira[19] gave a quite general algebraic model for conjectures and hypotheses, as well asconsequences. In their model, all statements or propositions of human thinking arerepresented as elements of an orthocomplemented lattice. They defined several interestingoperators in orthocomplemented lattices. These operators formalize our intuitive notions ofconjecture, consequence and hypothesis in an algebraic framework. Working in this model,they were able to present a nice classification of conjectures and consequences and to givea characterization of hypotheses.Orthocomplemented lattices are very general algebraic structures, and so Trillas,Cubillo and Castiñeira’s model provides us with a sufficiently broad framework in whichwe can describe mathematically conjectures and hypotheses. First, Boolean algebras areorthocomplemented lattices. Thus, the results obtained in [19] applies to Boolean (two-valued) logic. For example, Theorems 6.8 and 6.9 in [19] generalize Watanabe’s structuretheorem of hypotheses [20]; and Subsection 5.3 of [19] renders an abstract setting inwhich Reiter’s Default Logic [17] can be reformulated. Second, orthocomplementedlattices contain orthomodular lattices. Orthomodular lattices are often seen as thealgebraic counterpart of logic for quantum mechanics [2,15]. Perhaps, Trillas, Cubilloand Castiñeira’s model can be used to depict some research activities in the progress ofquantum mechanics. We can even anticipate that certain Knowledge Discovery techniquesdeveloped in the future based on the model proposed in [19] will help quantum physicistsin their researches.This paper is a continuation of [19], and the technical contribution is two-fold: (1) weimprove and complement some main results in [19]; and (2) we propose a graded version ofthe model in [19] so that it is able to deal with uncertainty and vagueness. The main body ofthis paper is divided into two parts. In the first part (i.e., Section 2), we present some furtherproperties of conjectures, consequences and hypotheses in orthocomplemented lattices.Theorem 2.2 of [19] establishes several inclusion relations between the operators ofconjecture, consequence and hypothesis, but leaves the problem when these inclusions willbecome equalities open. We solve this problem and find several sufficient and necessaryconditions under which the inclusions may be replaced by equalities (see Theorem 2.1).This is obviously a complement to Theorem 2.2 in [19]. Moreover, Theorem 2.2 inthe present paper gives a representation for each of the consequence, conjecture andhypothesis operators in terms of the others; and Theorem 2.8 examines various iterationsof these operators. This group of theorems thoroughly clarify the relation among theseoperators. Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 2.4 in [19] only show the up- and down-closedness ofconjectures, consequences and hypotheses, and Theorem 2.3 of this paper further considerstheir closedness under union and meet of the underlying lattice and carefully describes theiralgebraic structures. Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira give the smallest and greatest elementsM. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267255in a set of consequences (cf. [19, Theorem 2.5]), whereas we are able to compute the samething for conjectures and hypotheses (see Theorem 2.4). Under the condition that there is abijection with elements of the considered premise set as its pre-fixed points, Theorem 2.7in [19] demonstrates monotonicity of consequence, conjecture and hypothesis operators,and Theorem 2.5 of the present paper considerably weakens this condition. Furthermore,Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 show that these operators are homomorphisms with respect to setunion and intersection. Note that monotonicity is implied by the substitution property ofsuch homomorphisms. Finally, Theorem 2.9 in this paper generalizes Theorems 2.11 and2.12 into the situation where infinite-ary operations on the lattice under consideration areallowed. In summary, the results in Section 2 of the present paper complement or improvethose reported in [19].Many artificial intelligence systems use a certain sort of uncertain reasoning to leadfrom evidences or clues to guesses and conclusions under condition of partial or vagueinformation. Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira pointed out that the impact of certainty factorsof premises on the different types of conjectures is an interesting topic for further study(see [19, p. 256, lines 35–39], also see [3,4]). The second part of this paper (i.e., Section 3)is devoted to introducing the graded versions of notions of conjecture, consequenceand hypothesis in the framework of residuated lattices. These graded notions provideus with certain mathematical tools with which we can model conjectures, consequencesand hypotheses in the environment where uncertain and vague information is involved.Various properties concerning these graded operators are also carried out in Section 3. Todefine graded notions of conjecture, consequence and hypothesis, an implication operatorin the underlying lattice is needed, and it will be used to compare two elements (as therepresentations of two statements) of this lattice and to express the degree to which onestatement entails the other. It turns out that all implication operators that one can reasonablyimagine in orthocomplemented lattices are, to a certain extent, anomalous, at least in thesense that they do not share most of the fundamental properties which are satisfied by theimplication in classical logic (see [5, p. 431, lines 21–25]). By contrast, the residuationoperation in a residuated lattice [6,7] may serve as a natural interpretation of logicalimplication, and it possesses a lot of desirable properties. In particular, it retains manyuseful properties of implication in classical and intuitionistic logics. From this point ofview, orthocomplemented lattices and residuated lattices are at the opposite extreme pointsof the spectrum of lattices. Moreover, residuated lattices have close links with variousimportant logics. For example, if the multiplication adjoint to the residuation coincideswith the meet, then residuated lattices reduce to Heyting algebras, which play an importantrole in the investigation of intuitionistic formal theories. Goguen, Pavelka, et al. [12–14,21–27] used residuated lattice as a tool to cope with inexact reasoning and as a basis of fuzzylogic. If we take the unit interval with usual multiplication, a special residuated lattice, asthe set of truth values, a truth-functional system of probabilistic logic [18] may be seenas a residuated lattice-valued logic. (Note that a truth-functional version of probabilisticlogic is slightly different from that in [11] which is a non-truth-functional system.) Fromthe point of view of algebraic semantics, pure fragment of commutative linear logic [8] is aresiduated lattice-valued logic. This is why we choose residuated lattices as our underlyinglattices for defining graded operators of conjectures, consequences and hypotheses.256M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–2672. Some properties of conjectures, hypotheses and consequences inorthocomplemented latticesAn orthocomplemented lattice is a 6-tuple (L, +, ., (cid:3), 1, 0), where (L, +, .) is a lattice,it has the greatest element 1 and the least element 0, + and . represent the union and meetoperations respectively, and (cid:3) is a unary operation on L, called orthocomplementation,satisfying the following conditions:(1) a.a(cid:3) = 0,(2) a(cid:3)(cid:3) = a, and(3) a (cid:1) b implies b(cid:3) (cid:1) a(cid:3).A typical example of orthocomplemented lattice is a Boolean algebra, say theLindenbaum algebra of propositional logical formulas. Several orthocomplemented latticesthat are not Boolean algebras are shown in Fig. 4(1)–(4) of [19]. In this section, we alwaysassume that L is a complete orthocomplemented lattice. For any P ⊆ L, we write ∧Pand ∨P for the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of P respectively. Thus,a.b = ∧{a, b} and a + b = ∨{a, b} for all a, b ∈ L. As was done in [19], ∧P and ∨P areoften abbreviated to p∧ and p∨ respectively. Let a, b ∈ L. Then a and b are said to becontradictory if a (cid:1) b(cid:3), and they are incompatible if a.b = 0.The aim of [19] is to establish an algebraic model of conjectures, consequences andhypotheses in the framework of orthocomplemented lattices. In such a model, an elementof L will be used to denote a statement or a proposition. The main idea is to analysethe relations, among the elements of L, which depict the intuitive notions of conjectures,consequences and hypotheses. We denote P 0(L) = {P ⊆ L: P (cid:11)= φ and p∧ (cid:11)= 0}. Eachelement in P 0(L) will represent a non-empty set of premises. The condition p∧ (cid:11)= 0indicates that the premises in P are compatible.For any P ∈ P 0(L), Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira [19] defined:Φ∨(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∨ (cid:1) q (cid:3)},(cid:3)},Φ∧(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∧ (cid:1) qC∨(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∨ (cid:1) q},C∧(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∧ (cid:1) q},H (P ) = {q ∈ L: q (cid:1) p∧}.Intuitively, the operators Φ, C, H represent conjectures, consequences and hypotheses,respectively. The elements of Φ∨(P ) are called conjectures of P , and q ∈ Φ∨(P ) meansthat some p ∈ P are not contradictory to q. Φ∧(P ) is the set of strict conjectures ofP , and q ∈ Φ∧(P ) means that all p ∈ P are not contradictory to q. The differencebetween Φ∨(P ) and Φ∧(P ) as well as between C∨(P ) and C∧(P ) is the combinationof elements in the set P of premises. In Φ∨(P ), these premises are combined with union(i.e., disjunction), whereas in Φ∧(P ) they are combined with meet (i.e., conjunction). Thesame thing happens in C∨(P ) and C∧(P ). C∧(P ) is the set of consequences of P , andq ∈ C∧(P ) indicates that all premises in P together imply q. On the other hand, C∨(P )M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267257is the set of loose consequences of P , and q is a loose consequence of P if some premisein P implies q. H (P ) is the set of hypotheses of P , and each hypothesis of P implies allstatements in P . Furthermore, Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira [19] introduced some derivedoperators:∗C(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∧ (cid:1) q (cid:1) p∨},Φ(P ) = {q ∈ L: p∧ (cid:1) q (cid:3) (cid:1) p∨},HΦ∗Φ∗(P ) = H (P ) − {p∧},∧(P ) = Φ∧(P ) −∨(P ) = Φ∨(P ) − Φ∧(P ),(cid:1)C∧(P ) ∪ H (P )(cid:2),where P ∈ P 0(L) and for Φ(P ), it is required that p∨ (cid:11)= 1. Intuitively, C(P ) are therestricted consequences of P , H ∗(P ) is the set of proper hypotheses of P , Φ∗∧(P ) is theset of proper conjectures of P , Φ(P ) is the set of strict and restricted conjectures of P ,and Φ∗∨(P ) are the loose conjectures of P . If we use L to denote the Lindenbaum algebraof propositional logical formulas, then the intuitive meanings of these operators are clear.For example, let P be a set of formulas. Then φ ∈ Φ∨(P ), i.e., φ is a conjecture of P ifand only if each ψ in P does not implies the negation of φ. For more examples, we refer to[19, Sections 3 and 6.3]. These notions are also used to model Reiter’s Default Reasoning[17] in Section 5.2 of [19].The inclusion relations among Φ∨(P ), Φ∧(P ), C∨(P ), C∧(P ) and H (P ) are as follows(see [19, Theorem 2.2]):(a) C∨(P ) ⊆ C∧(P ) ⊆ Φ∧(P ) ⊆ Φ∨(P ).(b) H (P ) ⊆ Φ∧(P ).(c) P ⊆ C∧(P ).(d) C∧(P ) ∩ H (P ) = {p∧}.An interesting problem is when these inclusion relations degenerate to equalities.Among other things, the following theorem gives an answer to this problem.Theorem 2.1.(1) The following statements are equivalent:(a) P is a singleton, i.e., P has a unique element.(b) H (P ) ∩ C∨(P ) (cid:11)= φ.(c) P ⊆ C∨(P ).(d) P ⊆ H (P ).(e) Φ∨(P ) = Φ∧(P ), i.e., Φ∗(f) C∧(P ) = C∨(P ).∨(P ) = φ.(2) P ∩ C∨(P ) (cid:11)= φ if and only if p∨ ∈ P .(3) P ∩ H (P ) (cid:11)= φ if and only if p∧ ∈ P .(4) Φ∧(P ) = C∧(P ) if and only if p∧ is atomic, where a ∈ L is said to be atomic if foreach b ∈ L, it always holds that a (cid:1) b or a (cid:1) b(cid:3).258M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267(5) Φ∧(P ) = H (P ) if and only if P = {1}.(6) P = C∧(P ) if and only if P is a prime filter, i.e., p∧ ∈ P and P is upper-closed (i.e.,p (cid:1) q and p ∈ P implies q ∈ P ).(7) Φ∧(P ) = C∧(P ) ∪ H (P ), i.e., Φ∗∧(P ) = φ if and only if p∧ is sub-atomic, wherea ∈ L is said to be sub-atomic if a (cid:1) b implies that a and b(cid:3) are comparable, i.e.,a (cid:1) b or b(cid:3) (cid:1) a.Proof. Immediate. ✷To clarify further the relation among the operators Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨, C∧ and H , we nowconsider how one of them can be described in terms of the others.Theorem 2.2. For any Q ⊆ L, we write Q(cid:3) = {q (cid:3): q ∈ Q}. Then(1) Φ∧(P ) = L − (C∧(P ))(cid:3), C∧(P ) = L − (Φ∧(P ))(cid:3);(2) Φ∨(P ) = L − (C∨(P ))(cid:3), C∨(P ) = L − (Φ∨(P ))(cid:3); and(3) C∨(P ) = (H (P (cid:3)))(cid:3) ∪ {1}.Proof. Straightforward. ✷Now we consider the structures of Φ∨(P ), Φ∧(P ), C∨(P ), C∧(P ) and H (P ). Recallthat X ⊆ L is called a filter if a, b ∈ X implies a.b ∈ X, and a (cid:1) b and a ∈ X imply b ∈ X.Dually, X ⊆ L is called an ideal if a, b ∈ X implies a + b ∈ X, and a (cid:1) b ∈ X impliesa ∈ X.Theorem 2.3.(cid:3)(1) Φ∨(P ) is prime, i.e., for any qi ∈ L (i ∈ I ), ifi∈I qi ∈ Φ∨(P ), then qi0∈ Φ∨(P ) forsome i0 ∈ I .(2) Φ∧(P ) is prime.(3) C∨(P ) is closed under any intersection, i.e., for any qi ∈ L (i ∈ I ), if qi ∈ C∨(P ) for(cid:4)every i ∈ I , theni∈I qi ∈ C∨(P ). So, C∨(P ) is a filter.(4) C∧(P ) is closed under any intersection.(5) H (P ) is closed under any union, i.e., for any qi ∈ L (i ∈ I ), if qi ∈ C∨(P ) for every(cid:3)i ∈ I , theni∈I qi ∈ H (P ). So, H (P ) is an ideal.Proof. Immediate. ✷If a, b ∈ L, and a and b are not comparable, i.e., a (cid:1) b and b (cid:1) a, then we write aNCb.For any x ∈ L, we define:NC(x) = ∧{y ∈ L: yNCx},G(x) = ∧{y ∈ L: y > x}.If G(x) = x, then L is said to be upper-dense at x. Theorem 2.5 in [19] tells us that∧C∧(P ) = p∧ and ∧C∨(P ) = p∨. As a complement to this theorem, we have:M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267259Theorem 2.4.(1) ∧Φ∧(P ) = NC((p∧)(cid:3)).G((p∧)(cid:3)). In particular, if L is a chain, i.e., totally ordered (forany a, b ∈ L, a (cid:1) b or b (cid:1) b), and L is upper-dense at (p∧)(cid:3), then ∧Φ∧(P ) = (p∧)(cid:3) =∨P (cid:3). Furthermore, if P (cid:11)= {1}, then Φ∧(P ) ∈ P 0(L).(2) ∧Φ∨(P ) = NC((p∨)(cid:3)).G((p∨)(cid:3)).(3) ∨H (P ) = p∧.Proof. (1)∧Φ∧(P ) = ∧{q ∈ L: p∧ (cid:1) q (cid:3)}= ∧{q ∈ L: q (cid:1) (p∧)(cid:3)}= ∧{q ∈ L: qNC(p∧)(cid:1)(cid:1)(p∧)(cid:3)(p∧)(cid:3)= NC(cid:2).G(cid:3)}. ∧ {q ∈ L: q > (p∧)(cid:2).(cid:3)}(2) is similar to (1), and (3) is obvious. ✷The following theorem improves Theorem 2.7 in [19].Theorem 2.5. Let P , Q ∈ P 0(L).(1) If for every p ∈ P , there exists q ∈ Q such that p (cid:1) q, thenΦ∨(P ) ⊆ Φ∨(Q),C∨(Q) ⊆ C∨(P ).(2) If for every p ∈ P , there exists q ∈ Q such that q (cid:1) p, thenΦ∧(Q) ⊆ Φ∧(P ),C∧(P ) ⊆ C∧(Q),H (Q) ⊆ H (P ).Proof. By an argument of comparing elements. ✷Note that Theorem 2.7 in [19] requires that there exists a bijection f : P → Q such thatp (cid:1) f (p) for every p ∈ P . The above theorem weakens this condition and so improves theoriginal theorem.The following three theorems discuss the interaction between operators Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨,C∧, H and other operations on sets of premises. For any P , Q ⊆ L, we write:P .Q = {p.q: p ∈ P and q ∈ Q},P + Q = {p + q: p ∈ P and q ∈ Q}.Theorem 2.6. Let P , Q (cid:11)= φ and P ∪ Q ∈ P 0(L).(1) C∧(P ).C∧(Q) ⊆ C∧(P ∪ Q). In particular, if L is distributive, i.e., L is a Booleanalgebra, then C∧(P ∪ Q) = C∧(P ).C∧(Q).(2) C∨(P ∪ Q) = C∨(P ) + C∨(Q).(3) H (P ∪ Q) = H (P ).H (Q).260M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267Proof. (1)C∧(P ).C∧(Q) = {r1.r2: p∧ (cid:1) r1 and q∧ (cid:1) r2} ⊆ {r: ∧(P ∪ Q) = p∧.q∧ (cid:1) r}= C∧(P ∪ Q).Suppose that L is distributive. If r ∈ C∧(P ∪ Q), then p∧.q∧ (cid:1) r, r = p∧.q∧ +r = (p∧ + r).(q∧ + r). Note that p∧ + r ∈ C∧(P ) and q∧ + r ∈ C∧(Q). Thus, r ∈C∧(P ).C∧(Q).(2) Similar to (1), we can prove that C∨(P ) + C∨(Q) ⊆ C∨(P ∪ Q). Conversely,if r ∈ C∨(P ∪ Q), then r (cid:2) ∨(P ∪ Q) = p∨ + q∨ (cid:2) p∨, q∨ and r ∈ C∨(P ), C∨(Q).Furthermore, r = r.r ∈ C∨(P ).C∨(Q).(3) Similar to (2). ✷Theorem 2.7.(1) Φ∨((2) C∨((3) H ((cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)i∈I Pi ) =(cid:6)i∈I Pi ) =(cid:6)i∈I Pi) =i∈I Φ∨(Pi ). In particular, Φ∨(P ) =i∈I C∨(Pi ), and C∨(P ) =(cid:6)i∈I H (Pi), and H (P ) =p∈P H ({p}).p∈P C∨({p}).(cid:6)(cid:5)p∈P Φ∨({p}).Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.9 below. ✷We use L0 to denote L − {0}. The following theorem deals with various iterationsof operators Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨, C∧ and H . It is worth noting that Theorem 2.8(4) gives arepresentation of Φ∨ in terms of Φ∧ and C∨, and Theorem 2.8(7) gives a representation ofC∧ in terms of C∨ and H .Theorem 2.8.(1) Φ∨(Φ∧(P )) = Φ∨(C∨(P )) = Φ∨(C∧(P )) = L0.(2) C∨(Φ∨(P )) = C∨(C∧(P )) = C∨(Φ∧(P )) = {1}.(3) Φ∨(H (P )) = Φ∧(P ) if H (P ) ∈ P 0(L).(4) Φ∧(C∨(P )) = Φ∨(P ).(5) Φ∧(C∧(P )) = Φ∧(P ).(6) C∧(C∨(P )) = C∨(P ).(7) If H (P ) ∈ P 0(L), then C∨(H (P )) = C∧(P ).(8) H (C∧(P )) = H (P ).Proof. Straightforward. ✷For the case of a finite set P , Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira [19] introduced several newoperators:Gn =(cid:7)mapping g from Ln into L: g(x1, . . . , xn) (cid:2) x1, . . . , xn(cid:8)for all x1, . . . , xn ∈ L,Φg(Pn) = {q ∈ L: g(p1, . . . , pn) (cid:1) q (cid:3)},M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267261Cg(Pn) = {q ∈ L: g(p1, . . . , pn) (cid:1) q},CGn (Pn) = {g(p1, . . . , pn): g ∈ Gn}andfor any Pn = {p1, . . . , pn} ∈ P0(L) and for any g ∈ Gn.The above operators are generalizations of Φ, C and H , respectively. In fact, if wedefine:∨n(x1, . . . , xn) = x1 + · · · + xn,∧n(x1, . . . , xn) = x1, . . . , xnandfor every x1, . . . , xn ∈ L, thenΦ∨(Pn) = Φ∨n (Pn),C∨(Pn) = C∨n(Pn),Φ∧(Pn) = Φ∧n (Pn),C∧(Pn) = C∧n (Pn).In addition, it is easy to see that CGn (Pn) = {q ∈ L: p1, . . . , pn (cid:1) q} = C∧(Pn).The operators Φg and Cg can be further generalized to the case of infinite-ary g. Letα ∈ On (the class of ordinals). Then an α-ary operation on L is a mapping from Lα into L.For any α-ary operation g : Lα → L, and for any α-tuple x = {xβ : β < α} ∈ Lα, we candefine:(cid:3)},Φg(x) = {q ∈ L: g(x) (cid:1) qCg(x) = {q ∈ L: g(x) (cid:1) q}.andNow we can see that the above operators Φg(x) and Cg(x) are generalizations ofΦ∨(P ), Φ∧(P ), C∨(P ) and C∧(P ), respectively, even for the case of infinite P . LetP ∈ P 0(L) and α = |P | (the cardinality of P ). We set(cid:9)∨α({xβ: β < α}) =∧α({xβ: β < α}) =xβ,andβ<α(cid:10)β<αxβfor all xβ ∈ L (β < α). Moreover, P may be enumerated as an α-tuple p = {pβ : β < α}.ThenΦ∨(P ) = Φ∨α (p),C∨(P ) = C∨α (p),Φ∧(P ) = Φ∧α (p),C∧(P ) = C∧α (p).Suppose that gi is an α-ary operation on L for every i ∈ I . Then we definei∈I gi to be two α-ary operations on L such that(cid:4)(cid:11) (cid:9)(cid:12)gi(x) =(cid:12)gi(x) =i∈I(cid:11) (cid:10)i∈I(cid:9)i∈I(cid:10)i∈Igi(x),gi(x)for any x ∈ Lα.(cid:3)i∈I gi and262M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267Theorem 2.9.(1) Φ(cid:3)(2) C(cid:3)i∈I gi (x) =i∈I gi (x) =(cid:5)(cid:6)i∈I Φgi (x).i∈I Cgi (x).Proof. (1) First, we know thatq ∈ Φ(cid:3)i∈I gi (x)(cid:11) (cid:9)iff(cid:12)(cid:3)iff q (cid:1)gi(x)(cid:9)gi (x) =(cid:11) (cid:9)(cid:12)(x) (cid:1) q (cid:3)gii∈I=(cid:10)i∈I(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3),gi(x)andi∈Ii∈IΦgi (x)iff ∃i ∈ I such that q ∈ Φgi (x)q ∈(cid:13)i∈Iiff ∃i ∈ I such that gi (x) (cid:1) q (cid:3)(cid:1)iff ∃i ∈ I such that q (cid:3) (cid:1)gi (x).Therefore, it suffices to show that q (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)i∈I (gi(x))(cid:3) if and only if q (cid:1) (gi(x))(cid:3) for somei ∈ I . In fact, if it is not the case that there exists i ∈ I with q (cid:1) (gi(x))(cid:3), then for all i ∈ I ,q (cid:1) (gi (x))(cid:3) and q (cid:1)i∈I (gi (x))(cid:3), then it is obviousthat q (cid:1) (gi(x))(cid:3) for all i ∈ I .i∈I (gi(x))(cid:3). Conversely, if q (cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:3)i∈I gi (x) (cid:1) q if and only if gi (x) (cid:1) q for every(2) We only need to note thati ∈ I . ✷Through this section, it is required that a set P of premises satisfies the condition ofp∧ (cid:11)= 0. This design decision is to exclude contradiction from the premises. A much weakerassumption for this purpose would be: it is impossible that p (cid:1) q (cid:3) for all p, q ∈ P . We needthe requirement of p∧ (cid:11)= 0 in Theorem 2.1, but the other theorems in this section are stillvalid when it is replaced by the above weaker one.3. Conjectures, hypotheses and consequences in residuated latticesA residuated lattice is a 7-tuple (L, +, ., 0, 1, ⊗, →) where(i) (L, +, .) is a bounded lattice with the least element 0 and the greatest element 1;(ii) (⊗, →) is an adjoint couple on L, i.e., ⊗ and → satisfy the following conditions:(M) ⊗ is a binary operation on L and it is isotone in both the two variables,(R) → is a binary operation on L and it is antitone in the first and isotone in thesecond variable, and(c) for all a, b, c ∈ L, a ⊗ b (cid:1) c if and only if a (cid:1) b → c; and(iii) (L, ⊗, 1) is a commutative monoid.The operation ⊗ is called multiplication, and → is called residuation. For more details,we refer to [6,7,13]. A typical example of residuated lattice is the unit interval equippedM. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267263with one of the following three pairs of multiplication and residuation operations: for alla, b ∈ [0, 1],(1) Heyting operators: a ⊗ b = min(a, b),(cid:14)1b(2) Probabilistic operators: a ⊗ b = a × b,(cid:15)if a (cid:1) b,otherwise.a → b =a → b =1b/aif a (cid:1) b,otherwise.(3) Lukasiewicz operators: a ⊗ b = max(0, a + b − 1), a → b = min(1, 1 − a + b).Now let (L, +, ., ⊗, →) be a complete residuated lattice, and let 1 and 0 be the greatestand least elements of L, respectively. For any a ∈ L, its complementation is defined bya(cid:3) = a → 0. The contradiction in L is defined to be Con =x∈L−{0}(x → x(cid:3)) ∈ L. Theintuitive meaning of Con is that there is a statement which is not false and implies itsnegation. Furthermore, the weak complementation of a ∈ L is defined by a⊥ = a → Con.Clearly, a(cid:3) (cid:1) a⊥. We now are ready to introduce the graded operators of conjectures,consequences and hypotheses in residuated lattices. As what was done in Section 2, wehere also only consider sets P of premises in P 0(L) = {P ⊆ L: P (cid:11)= φ and p∧ (cid:11)= 0}. Forany P ∈ P 0(L), and for any q ∈ P , we define:(cid:3)(cid:3)Φ∨(P )(q) = (p∨ → q (cid:3))⊥,⊥Φ∧(P )(q) = (p∧ → q,C∨(P )(q) = p∨ → q,C∧(P )(q) = p∧ → q,H (P )(q) = q → p∧.)andThus, for each P ∈ P 0(L), Φ∨(P ), Φ∧(P ), C∨(P ), C∧(P ), H (P ) ∈ LL (the set of allmappings from L into itself), and Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨, C∧ and H are all mappings from 2L (thepower set of L, i.e., the set of all subsets of L) into LL. The above definitions are thegraded versions of Trillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira’s corresponding operators. For example,Φ∧(P )(q) expresses the degree to which q is a strict conjecture of P , and it may be seenas the truth value of the proposition “it is a contradiction that all premises in P togetherimplies the negation of q”. Let L be the unit interval with the probabilistic operators. Thenit follows that Con = 0 anda⊥ = a(cid:3) =(cid:14)1 if a = 0,0 otherwise.Moreover, suppose that P is the interval [1/3, 1/2], and each value in P may be used toindicate the belief degree of a certain statement. For any λ ∈ [0, 1], by a routine calculationwe haveΦ∨(P )(λ) = Φ∧(P )(λ) =(cid:15)(cid:15)01if λ = 0,otherwise,C∨(P )(λ) =if λ (cid:2) 1/2,12λ otherwise,264M. Ying, H. Wang / Artificial Intelligence 139 (2002) 253–267(cid:15)C∧(P )(λ) =(cid:15)H (P )(λ) =if λ (cid:2) 1/3,13λ otherwise,andif λ (cid:1) 1/3,11/3λ otherwise.Intuitively, for instance, if λ = 2/3, then the belief degree of the assertion that a statementwhose belief degree is λ may be seen as a hypothesis of some premises with belief degreesin the interval P = [1/3, 1/2] will be 1/2.We now turn to present some interesting properties of the operators introduced above.Theorem 3.1.(1) For any p ∈ P , C∧(P )(p) = 1.(2) For any q ∈ L,C∨(P )(q) (cid:1) C∧(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∨(P )(q),H (P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q).and(3) C∧(P )(q).H (P )(q) = 1 if and only if q = p∧.Proof. We only show that C∧(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q). Similarly, H (P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q) canbe proven, and the others are obvious.(cid:1)p∧ → (q → 0)(cid:1)q → (p∧ → 0)C∧(P )(q) ⊗ (p∧ → q (cid:3)) = (p∧ → q) ⊗= (p∧ → q) ⊗(cid:1) p∧ → (p∧ → 0)= p∧ → (p∧)C∧(P )(q) (cid:1) (p∧ → q (cid:3)) → Con = (p∧ → q (cid:3))⊥ = Φ∧(P )(q).(cid:3) (cid:1) Con,and(cid:2)(cid:2)✷It is clear that the above theorem is a graded generalization of Theorem 2.2 in [19]. Onemay conceive that it is natural to define Φ∨(P ) and Φ∧(P ) in the following way:Φ∨(P )(q) = (p∨ → q(cid:3)(cid:3)),and Φ∧(P )(q) = (p∧ → q(cid:3)(cid:3))for every q ∈ L. However, with these modified definitions, C∧(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q) andH (P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(q) do not hold any more.Theorem 3.2.(1) If q (cid:1) r, thenΦ∨(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∨(P )(r),(2) C∨(P )((3) H (P )((cid:4)(cid:3)i∈I qi) =i∈I qi) =(cid:4)(cid:4)i∈I C∨(P )(qi), C∧(P )(i∈I H (P )(qi).Φ∧(P )(q) (cid:1) Φ∧(P )(r).(cid:4)(cid:4)i∈I qi) =i∈I C∧(P )(qi ).Proof. Easy. ✷M. Ying, H.

Straightforward. ✷Suppose that ϕ : 2L → LL be a mapping. Then its natural extension ϕ : LL → LL isdefined as follows: for any A ∈ LL and for any x ∈ L,(cid:9)ϕ(A)(x) =[λ ⊗ ϕ(Aλ)(x)],λ∈Lwhere Aλ = {x ∈ L: A(x) (cid:2) λ} ⊆ L is the λ-cut of A for each λ ∈ L. For simplicity, ϕ isoften abbreviated to ϕ.Theorem 3.5. For any P ⊆ L, C∧(C∧(P )) = C∧(P ).Proof. From Theorems 3.1(1) and 3.3(1) we know that P ⊆ C∧(P ) and C∧(P )(q) (cid:1)C∧(C∧(P )λ)(q). Then(cid:1)C∧(P )(cid:2)C∧(q) =(cid:9)(cid:16)λ ⊗ C∧(cid:1)C∧(P )λ(cid:2)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:16)(q)(cid:2)λ ⊗ C∧(P )(q)(cid:17)(cid:12)λ∈Lλ⊗ C∧(P )(q) = 1 ⊗ C∧(P )(q) = C∧(P )(q).=λ∈L(cid:11) (cid:9)λ∈LConversely, for any λ ∈ L, we haveC∧(P )λ = {q ∈ L: C∧(P )(q) = p∧ → q (cid:2) λ} = {q ∈ L: λ ⊗ p∧ (cid:1) q},∧C∧(P )λ = λ ⊗ p∧,(cid:1)C∧(P )λ(cid:2)C∧(q) = ∧C∧(P )λ → q = (λ ⊗ p∧) → q= λ → (p∧ → q),and266M.

Concluding remarksTrillas, Cubillo and Castiñeira [19] introduced the operators Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨, C∧ andH in orthocomplemented lattices as an algebraic model of conjectures, consequencesand hypotheses. In this framework, they presented a classification of conjectures andconsequences and gave a characterization of hypotheses.In the first part of this paper, we obtain some new properties of conjectures,consequences and hypotheses in orthocomplemented lattices. These results complement orimprove some theorems in [19]. In the second part of this paper, to deal with conjectures,consequences and hypotheses in the environment where uncertain and vague informationis essential, we employ residuated lattices as our mathematical model and introduce gradedversions of operators Φ∨, Φ∧, C∨, C∧ and H . Some properties of these graded operatorsare derived.Alchourron, Gärdenfors and Makinson [1] proposed a theory of belief revision. Aninteresting topic for further study is to establish an algebraic generalization of this theorywithin orthocomplemented lattices as well as residuated lattices, in the spirit of [19] andthis paper.AcknowledgementsThe authors are very grateful to Professor Bernhard Nebel, Research Notes Editor, andthe anonymous referees for their invaluable comments and suggestions that highly help usin improving the presentation of this paper.References[1] C.E.
