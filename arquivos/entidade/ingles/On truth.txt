IntroductionA defining feature of vague concepts is that they admit borderline cases which neither definitely satisfy the conceptnor its negation. For example, there are some height values which would neither be definitely classified as being short nornot short. For propositions involving vague concepts this naturally results in truth-gaps. In other words, there are cases inwhich a proposition is neither absolutely true nor absolutely false. If Ethel’s height lies in a certain intermediate range then theproposition ‘Ethel is short’ may be inherently borderline. Such truth-gaps suggest that a non-Tarskian notion of truth may berequired to capture this aspect of vagueness even in a simple propositional framework. There has been a number of differentpossibilities proposed in the literature for this alternative model of truth including three-valued logics and supervaluations.In the sequel we will discuss and relate two different models of truth-gaps, supervaluationism and Kleene’s strong three-valued logic, in the context of a new framework for bipolar valuations. In particular, we will investigate propositionaltruth-models taking the form of a lower and an upper truth valuation on the sentences of the language. The underlyingidea is that, given such a valuation pair, the lower truth valuation represents the strong criterion of being absolutely true,while the upper valuation represents the weaker criterion of being not absolutely false. In this context, borderline statementsare those for which there is a difference between the lower and upper valuations (i.e. a truth-gap).* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: j.lawry@bris.ac.uk (J.

Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4121A different perspective on borderline cases relates to the notion of assertability. Here we take the view that conceptdefinitions are to a large extent determined by linguistic convention, and according to such conventions a statement may ormay not be assertable given a particular state of the world. Interestingly, a case can be made that assertability is inherentlybipolar, a phenomenon which manifests itself in a distinction between those propositions which convention would deemdefinitely assertable, and those which convention would not classify as incorrect, or perhaps even dishonest, to assert. Parikh[27] observes that:Certain sentences are assertible in the sense that we might ourselves assert them and other cases of sentences whichare non-assertible in the sense that we ourselves (and many others) would reproach someone who used them. But therewill also be the intermediate kind of sentences, where we might allow their use.For example, consider a witness in a court of law describing a suspect as being short. Depending on the actual heightof the suspect this statement may be deemed as clearly true or clearly false, in which latter case the witness could beaccused of perjury. However, there will also be an intermediate height range for which, while there may be doubt anddiffering opinions concerning the use of the description short, it would not be deemed as definitely inappropriate and hencethe witness would not be viewed as committing perjury. In other words, for certain height values of the suspect, it maybe acceptable to assert the statement ‘the suspect was short’, even though this statement would not be viewed as beingabsolutely true. Clearly there is a natural connection between this bipolar aspect of assertability and the idea of truth-gapsfor borderline cases outlined above. If a statement θ is absolutely true, a judgment which is of course dependent both onthe state of the world and on how linguistic convention defines the relevant concepts, then θ would be definitely assertable.On the other hand, provided that θ is not absolutely false then θ would be deemed acceptable to assert. The bipolarityof assertability would seem to be a special case of what Dubois and Prade [7] refer to as symmetric bivariate unipolarity,whereby judgments are made according to two distinct evaluations on unipolar scales, i.e. distinct evaluations about theassertability of a sentence and its negation. In the current context, we have a strong and a weak evaluation criterion wherethe former corresponds to definite assertability and the latter to acceptable assertability. As with many examples of thistype of bipolarity there is a natural duality between the two evaluation criteria in that a proposition is definitely assertableif and only if it is not acceptable to assert its negation.The adequate representation of epistemic uncertainty is of central importance in any effective model of belief. Typicallywe think of uncertainty as arising because of insufficient information about the state of the world. However, in the presenceof vagueness there may also be semantic uncertainty due to our having only partial knowledge of language conventions.For example, consider the proposition ‘Ethel is short’. Here an agent with certain knowledge of Ethel’s height may stillbe uncertain as to the truth of this proposition due to uncertainty about the conventions governing the definition of theconcept short. Such uncertainty may naturally arise from the distributed manner in which language is learnt across apopulation of communicating agents. Semantic uncertainty often occurs in conjunction with a lack of knowledge concerningthe underlying state of the world. In our example, the agent may also be uncertain as to the precise value of Ethel’s height.In the sequel then we propose an integrated model of semantic and stochastic uncertainty in the context of languageconventions which admit borderline cases. Here we view truth as a function of both the state of the world, e.g. Ethel’sheight, and language convention, e.g. the interpretation of the concept short in terms of height values. An integrated modelof epistemic uncertainty and truth-gaps can then take the form of a probability distribution on the cross product of the setof possible world states and the set of possible language conventions. Furthermore, if a convention maps each state of theworld to a valuation pair, then this naturally results in a probability distribution on possible valuation pairs. Given such adistribution we can immediately define lower and upper measures by evaluating the probabilities of those valuation pairsin which a given sentence is absolutely true and of those in which it is not absolutely false respectively. We refer to theselower and upper measures on the sentences of the language as a bipolar belief pair.We argue that valuation pairs are one of the most straight-forward representations of truth-gaps in natural languagepropositions. Hence, by taking a probability distribution over a set of possible valuation pairs for the language we generatea very natural integrated model of belief for propositions and sentences which involve vague concepts and about whichthere is inherent uncertainty. As such, the proposed framework provides an ideal platform from which we can begin toexplore issues concerning the utility of vagueness in communication. Certainly there are many potential applications ofsuch a study including in natural language generation [39], consensus modelling [24] and multi-agent dialogues [22]. In thispaper we shall focus mainly on the first of these application areas.A fundamental open problem in natural language generation is that of understanding why individuals often chooseto make vague assertions rather than semantically similar crisp (non-vague) ones. In particular, what are the practicaladvantages of such a decision from the perspective of an asserting agent? One approach is to apply decision theory so thatutility values are associated with different expressions quantifying the benefit or gain resulting from their assertion givena particular state of the world and in the context of particular language conventions. Given such a formalism the problemis then that of understanding why, in certain situations, a vague assertion may result in a higher expected utility than fora similar crisp assertion. One type of situation where vague assertions may be preferable in this way, is referred to byvan Deemter [39] as future contingencies. Here we assume that agents are playing what may, to some extent, be seen asa non-cooperative language game in which different agents have different, and possibly conflicting, goals and objectives.Within communication environments of this kind there may be a risk associated with making forecasts or promises which22J.

This would then be reflected in the utility values for different assertionswithin a particular context. Mitigating this risk is certainly of practical importance is AI systems such as for automaticweather forecasting or medical diagnosis. In [39] it is suggested that for predictions or promises vague assertions maybe lower risk than crisp ones. In this paper we shall apply the bipolar belief framework outlined above to carry out avery preliminary study of future contingencies, from a decision theoretic perspective. The aim will be to demonstrate thepotential of our approach for modelling assertion behaviour, as well as providing some small insight into how truth-gapsmay be exploited so as to minimise risk and maximise gain in complex multi-agent dialogues.An outline of the paper is as follows: In following section we describe several approaches to modelling truth-gapsand emphasise how these differ from theories of epistemic uncertainty. Section 3 then introduces valuation pairs andprovides axiomatic characterisations both of supervaluation pairs and of Kleene valuation pairs. In this section we alsoinvestigate the relationship between Kleene and supervaluation pairs as well as discussing the functionality and truth-functionality of different classes of valuation pairs. Section 4 proposes bipolar belief measures as an integrated modelcombining epistemic uncertainty and truth-gaps. We discuss the motivation and justification for defining lower and upperbelief measures generated from probability distributions on valuation pairs, and investigate the properties of such beliefpairs especially relating to a semantic precision ordering on valuation pairs. This section will also include an explorationof the relationship between classes of bipolar belief measures and other types of uncertainty measures, such as possibilitymeasures and interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 5 outlines a very preliminary decision theoretic analysis of the use of vaguestatements in order to mitigate the risk associated with making predictions or promises. Finally, Section 6 gives conclusionsand proposes some future directions of study.2. Models for truth-gapsIn this section we outline two general approaches to the modelling of truth-gaps in propositional logic. The first is thatof three-valued logics in which an additional truth-value is included in the underlying truth-model in order to representborderline cases. A fully truth-functional calculus is then defined for the truth-values T = {t, b, f} where t denotes absolutelytrue, b denotes borderline and f denotes absolutely false. Different logics are then characterised by different three-valuedtruth-tables for the different connectives. Well known examples of three-valued logics include Lukasiewicz logic [26] andKleene’s weak and strong logics [16]. For example, Table 1 shows the truth-tables for the connectives ¬ (negation), ∧(conjunction) and ∨ (disjunction) for Kleene’s strong logic.By referring to the middle truth-value as borderline we have consciously adopted somewhat non-standard terminology.Both Lukasiewicz and Kleene use terminology suggestive of an epistemic interpretation of b corresponding to either possiblytrue or unknown.1 This would seem to assume an underlying binary truth-model about which there is only partial orincomplete knowledge. However, this view is problematic since, as highlighted by Dubois [6], three-valued logics do notprovide an adequate model of ignorance or partial knowledge. For example, even if there is uncertainty concerning thebinary truth-value of a proposition p then the contradiction p ∧ ¬p would still be known to be false since it is false in allbinary valuations. However, for Kleene’s strong logic we can see from Table 1 that if p has the middle truth-value then sohas p ∧ ¬p.In contrast to the epistemic view, here we are interested in the application of three-valued logic to model truth-gapsfor propositions involving vague concepts. From this perspective a proposition may be known to be borderline. For example,given absolute certainty about Ethel’s height then we may also be certain that the proposition p = ‘Ethel is tall’ is aborderline case. The intermediate truth-value of p results then from the inherent flexibility in the concept tall and isnot the result of a lack of knowledge about any underlying binary truth-model. Indeed, from this perspective there is nounderlying binary truth-model since truth valuations on vague propositions are inherently three-valued.A second model of truth-gaps is supervaluationism as proposed by Fine [10] (see also Williamson [44] for an exposi-tion).2 In this approach it is assumed that vague concepts have different admissible precise interpretations referred to asprecisifications. For example, the concept tall may admit a range of admissible threshold values on height, each defining adifferent precisification of the concept. The simplest formulation of supervaluationism in a propositional logic frameworkis in terms of a set of admissible classical (Tarski) valuations. In this case a sentence is said to be supertrue if it is true inevery admissible classical valuation and superfalse if it is false in every admissible valuation (i.e. its negation is supertrue).1 Shapiro [35] uses the term indeterminate which seems closer to our interpretation.2 The term supervaluationism was originally introduced by van Fraasen [41] with regard to the truth-gaps which result when some of the terms in apredicate logic language do not have referents in a particular interpretation.J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4123Borderline cases are then those sentences which are neither supertrue nor superfalse. Notice, however, that unlike three-valued logic supervaluationism preserves classical tautologies, contradictions and equivalences. For example, even thoughproposition p and its negation ¬p may both be borderline cases, p ∨ ¬p and p ∧ ¬p are always supertrue and superfalserespectively. Furthermore, if two propositional logic sentences are classically equivalent then they are either both supertrue,both superfalse or both borderline.The relationship between supervaluationism and models of partial or incomplete knowledge is perhaps less straight-forward than in the case of three-valued logic. In one sense there clearly is an underlying binary truth-model sincesupervaluations are defined in terms of sets of classical valuations. Indeed, sets of valuations have been proposed as away of representing incomplete knowledge of an agent’s beliefs. An example of such a model would be Boolean (two-valued)possibility theory [9,3] in which the necessity or possibility of a sentence is decided on the basis of whether or not it isrespectively a direct consequence of, or consistent with a set of sentences K representing the agent’s incomplete beliefsabout the world. In this context, K can be characterised by the set of valuations for which every sentence in K is true,and hence a sentence is necessarily true if it is true in every such valuation and possibly true if it is true in some of thesevaluations. However, in supervaluationism we are using sets of valuations in a completely different way so as to capturevagueness rather than partial knowledge. To explain the difference between these two distinct uses of sets of valuations weshall employ the notions of conjunctive and disjunctive sets [42,5].A conjunctive set is an inclusive collection of elements representing a conjunctive property, whereas a disjunctive set isan exclusive collection of elements each representing one of a number of possibilities only one of which can actually berealised. For example, the set of languages spoken by Ethel is a conjunctive set since each element is equally admissible,while the set {1, . . . , 6} representing the possible outcomes of a throw of a die is a disjunctive set since, while all outcomesare possible, only one outcome can be the actual score. We argue then that the sets of valuations in supervaluationismare conjunctive, while those in Boolean possibility theory are disjunctive. More specifically, in supervaluationism a set ofvaluations identifies a conjunction of interpretations all of which are admissible precisifications, whereas in Boolean possi-bility theory the set of valuations correspond to possible epistemic states, only one of which is the true state of the world.Interestingly, this view of supervaluationism is what Smith [36] refers to as plurivaluationism, according to which a languagehas multiple valid interpretations.In the following sections we introduce valuation pairs as a general model of truth-gaps for sentences from a propositionallanguage, and which allows for a unified treatment of supervaluationism and three-valued logics. Such a treatment willenable us to make a close comparison between the different truth-models, and here we shall focus in particular on therelationship between supervaluationism and Kleene’s strong logic.3. Valuation pairsValuation pairs provide a direct, and relatively straightforward, model of truth-gaps and indeterminism based on twoprimitive truth-states; absolutely true and not absolutely false. These lower and upper truth-states then drive (or are perhapsmotivated by) the type of bipolarity of assertability identified by Parikh [27] as being fundamental to the use of vagueconcepts in natural language. In this section we give the general definition of valuation pairs and identify a number ofsub-classes of valuations pairs for further study. Initially, however, we recall some basic concepts from propositional logic.Let L be a language of propositional logic with connectives ∧, ∨ and ¬ and a finite set of propositional variablesP = {p1, . . . , pn}. Let SL denote the sentences of L generated by recursive application of the connectives to P . We alsodefine SL+as the sentences of L generated recursively from the propositional variables by application of the connectives∧ and ∨ only, and similarly we let SL−denote the sentences of L generated recursively from the negated propositionalvariables by application of ∧ and ∨ only. Here we can think of SL+as theset of entirely negative sentences of L respectively.as the set of entirely positive sentences and SL−Classical valuations are based on Tarski’s binary truth-model as follows:Definition 1 (Classical valuations). A classical valuation v is a function v : SL → {0, 1} satisfying ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL,• v(¬θ) = 1 − v(θ)• v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v(θ), v(ϕ))• v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max(v(θ), v(ϕ))A classical valuation is characterised by a subset F ⊆ P so that:v F (pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ FOn the basis of classical valuations we can then define the standard propositional logic notions of entailment and equiv-alence according to which θ |(cid:9) ϕ (ϕ follows from θ ) if for all classical valuations v(θ) = 1 implies that v(ϕ) = 1, and θ ≡ ϕ(θ and ϕ are equivalent) if for all classical valuations v(θ) = v(ϕ). A sentence θ is then a classical tautology (denoted |(cid:9) θ )if v(θ) = 1 in all classical valuations, while θ is a classical contradiction |(cid:9) ¬θ if v(θ) = 0 for all classical valuations.24J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41Definition 2 (Atoms of L). The atoms of L are those sentences of the form:α =n(cid:2)i=1±pi where +pi denotes the propositional pi and −pi denotes the negated propositional variable ¬piFor atom α ∈ SL let Fα = {pi: α |(cid:9) pi}. Also any subset F ⊆ P characterises an atom so that:(cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:4)∧pi¬pi(cid:4)αF =pi ∈Fpi /∈FBy the Disjunctive Normal Form theorem it holds that ∀θ ∈ SL,(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:7)θ ≡αF where Pθ =F : v F (θ) = 1F ∈PθDefinition 3 (Valuation pairs). A valuation pair is a pair of functions (cid:11)v = (v, ¯v) where v : SL → {0, 1} and ¯v : SL → {0, 1}such that v (cid:2) ¯v. Furthermore, ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL, if v(θ) = ¯v(θ) = α and v(ϕ) = ¯v(ϕ) = β then v(¬θ) = ¯v(¬θ) = 1 − α, v(θ ∧ ϕ) =¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(α, β) and v(θ ∨ ϕ) = ¯v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max(α, β).Intuitively, v and ¯v are valuation functions for the truth-states absolutely true and not absolutely false respectively. Therequirement that v (cid:2) ¯v formally defines v as a stronger criterion than ¯v. Hence, a sentence θ ∈ SL is absolutely true onlyif it is not absolutely false. However, the converse does not necessarily hold in which case the difference between ¯v andv is due to inherent vagueness in the sentences of L. So if ¯v(θ) − v(θ) = 1 then θ is a borderline case which is neitherabsolutely true nor absolutely false. In other words, θ is a sentence which while not definitely assertable is nonethelessacceptable to assert. In the case that we restrict ourselves to sentences of L which are not viewed as being borderline itis assumed that valuation pairs behave like classical valuations as given in Definition 1. Indeed, from the perspective ofDefinition 3, classical valuations can be viewed as special cases of valuation pairs in which v = ¯v.In the following definition we propose supervaluation pairs as a valuation pair model of supervaluationism. A supervalu-ation pair is defined by a set of classical valuations which, when adopting the set of propositional variables characterisationof classical valuations outlined above, is represented by a subset P of 2P (i.e. the power set of P ). In this context v(θ) = 1if and only if sentence θ is true in every admissible classical valuation in P , while ¯v(θ) = 1 if and only if θ is true in atleast one classical valuation in P . Clearly then we are identifying the truth-state absolutely true with supertruth and that ofnot absolutely false with non-superfalsehood. Upper valuations of the latter kind have been investigated by Hyde [14] whorefers to them as subvaluations.Definition 4 (Supervaluation pairs). Let ∅ (cid:13)= P ⊆ 2P then a supervaluation pair (cid:11)v = (v, ¯v) generated by P is given by: ∀θ ∈ SL(cid:6)v(θ) = minv F (θ): F ∈ P(cid:7)and ¯v(θ) = max(cid:6)v F (θ): F ∈ P(cid:7)In the sequel we will show that supervaluation pairs retain many of the properties of classical valuations includingclassical equivalence, so that if θ ≡ ϕ then (cid:11)v(θ) = (cid:11)v(ϕ) for all supervaluation pairs, and classical tautologies, so that if |(cid:9) θthen (cid:11)v(θ) = (1, 1) for all supervaluation pairs. Furthermore, supervaluation pairs satisfy the natural duality property that forsentence θ , v(¬θ) = 1 − ¯v(θ) and ¯v(¬θ) = 1 − v(θ). In other words, a sentence is absolutely true if and only if its negationis absolutely false. An obvious consequence of this and the fact that supervaluation pairs preserve classical tautologies isthat classical contradictions are also preserved.A supervaluation pair (cid:11)v = (v, ¯v) naturally identifies lower and upper sets of propositional variables of the form F = {pi ∈P : v(pi) = 1} ⊆ F = {pi ∈ P : ¯v(pi) = 1}. Notice immediately that for any F ∈ P it must hold that F ⊆ F ⊆ F , however, itdoes not necessarily follow from Definition 4 that either F or F are themselves in P . In the next definition we identifybounded supervaluation pairs as the class of supervaluation pairs for which P ⊇ {F , F }. The failure to include F or F in Phas the following interesting consequences. If F /∈ P then (cid:11)v(¬pi) = (0, 1) for pi ∈ F − F while (cid:11)v(¬pi) = (0, 0).In other words, even though the negation of every propositional variable in F − F is a borderline case their conjunctionis absolutely false. Similarly, if F /∈ P , then (cid:11)v(pi ∈F −F pi) = (0, 0). That is, the conjunction of all borderline propositionalvariables in L is absolutely false. Hence, for bounded supervaluation pairs we are restricting ourselves to sets of admissibleclassical valuations which include a valuation in which all borderline propositional variables are true, and also one in whichthey are all false.pi ∈F −F(cid:8)(cid:8)Definition 5 (Bounded supervaluation pairs). A bounded supervaluation pair is a supervaluation pair where ∃F , F ∈ P suchthat F ⊆ F and ∀F ∈ P , F ⊆ F ⊆ F .J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4125Complete bounded supervaluation pairs are a more restricted class of bounded supervaluation pairs intended to capture thesituation in which an agent’s truth-model is generated solely by them considering propositional variables, and by identifyingthose propositional variables which are absolutely true and those which are not absolutely false. The agent then simplyidentifies the set of admissible valuations as being all those classical valuations consistent with these lower and uppervaluations of the propositional variables.Definition 6 (Complete bounded supervaluation pairs). A complete bounded supervaluation pair is a bounded supervaluationpair where P = {F : F ⊆ F ⊆ F }.An alternative approach to defining valuation pairs is via compositional rules for each of the connectives. In particular,Kleene valuation pairs are defined in terms of an explicit duality rule for negation together with min and max combinationoperators for conjunction and disjunction respectively. Kleene valuation pairs have already been defined in [23], where someof their basic properties were described.Definition 7 (Kleene valuation pairs). A Kleene valuation pair is a valuation pair (cid:11)v = (v, ¯v) such that ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL the followinghold:• v(¬θ) = 1 − ¯v(θ) and ¯v(¬θ) = 1 − v(θ)• v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v(θ), v(ϕ)) and ¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ))• v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max(v(θ), v(ϕ)) and ¯v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ))There is a natural link between Kleene valuation pairs and Kleene’s strong three-valued logic [16]. This can be seenclearly when we view the three possible values of a valuation pair for a sentence as truth-values, i.e. t = (1, 1) as absolutelytrue, b = (0, 1) as borderline and f = (0, 0) as absolutely false. If we then view a valuation pair as a function (cid:11)v : SL → Twhere T = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)} then Kleene valuation pairs as given in Definition 7, satisfy the truth-tables for Kleene’sstrong three-valued logic as described in Section 2, Table 1.In contrast to supervaluation pairs, Kleene valuation pairs do not preserve classical tautologies and contradictions. Indeedfrom a well-known property of Kleene’s strong logic there are no sentences θ for which (cid:11)v(θ) = (1, 1) for all Kleene valuationpairs. However, the laws of excluded middle and non-contradiction are at least partially preserved since θ ∨ ¬θ is notabsolutely false and θ ∧ ¬θ is not absolutely true for all Kleene valuation pairs. Furthermore, Kleene valuation pairs do notpreserve all classical equivalences. For example, consider a Kleene valuation pair for which (cid:11)v(p1) = (0, 0) and (cid:11)v(p2) = (0, 1).In this case (cid:11)v(p1 ∨ (p2 ∧ ¬p2)) = (0, 1) (cid:13)= (0, 0) = (cid:11)v(p1). However, a number of classical equivalences are preserved [23]including, de Morgan’s laws, double negation, idempotence, commutativity, associativity and distributivity.Notice, that classical valuation pairs can be viewed as special cases of both Kleene and supervaluation pairs in whichv = ¯v. Of course many other classes of valuation pairs can also be defined including, for example, valuation pairs relatedto Lukasiewicz three-valued logic.3 However, for the scope of this paper we will focus on supervaluation pairs and Kleenevaluation pairs, so as to explore the relationship between them. In the following section we will investigate axiomatic justi-fications for both these families of valuation pairs in terms of a set of ‘desirable’ properties for lower and upper valuations.Initially, however, we introduce notation for sets of valuation pairs of different classes.Definition 8 (Classes of valuation pairs).• Let V denote the set of all valuation pairs on L.• Let Vc denote the set of all classical valuations on L.• Let Vs denote the set of all supervaluation pairs on L.• Let Vbs ⊆ Vs denote the set of all bounded supervaluation pairs on L.• Let Vcbs ⊆ Vbs denote the set of complete bounded supervaluation pairs on L.• Let Vk denote the set of Kleene valuation pairs on L.3.1. Axioms for valuation pairsHere we introduce a number of elementary properties which it might be considered desirable for a valuation pair tosatisfy. The aim is to provide an axiomatic characterisation of some of the classes of valuation pairs introduced in theprevious subsection, in terms of a small number of basic requirements for truth-models of indeterminacy.VP1 (Duality) ∀θ ∈ SL, v(¬θ) = 1 − ¯v(θ) and ¯v(¬θ) = 1 − v(θ).3 Lukasiewicz valuation pairs can be defined such that: v(¬θ) = 1 − ¯v(θ) and ¯v(¬θ) = 1 − v(θ), v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v(θ), v(ϕ)) and ¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) =max(min(v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)), min( ¯v(θ), v(ϕ))) and v(θ ∨ ϕ) = min(max(v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)), max( ¯v(θ), v(ϕ))) and ¯v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)).26J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41VP2 (Tautology Preservation) If |(cid:9) θ (i.e. θ is a classical tautology) then (cid:11)v(θ) = (1, 1).VP3 (Equivalence) If θ ≡ ϕ (i.e. θ and ϕ are classically equivalent) then (cid:11)v(θ) = (cid:11)v(ϕ).VP4 (Maximum Upper) ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL, ¯v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)).VP5 (Maximum Lower) ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL, v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max(v(θ), v(ϕ)).VP1 is simply the duality property for negation already discussed above, in which it is required that a sentence is abso-lutely true if and only if its negation is absolutely false. VP2 and VP3 require the preservation of classical tautologies andequivalences. Also, notice that when taken together with VP1, VP2 also implies the preservation of classical contradictions.The fundamental idea here is that valuation pairs are simply a generalisation of classical valuations so as to admit indeter-minacy, and there is no reason that such a generalisation should result in a change to the underlying logical equivalencesbetween sentences of the language. Furthermore, if a sentence is universally true across all interpretations of the language inwhich the underlying concepts are assumed to be crisp, then it should also be absolutely true in any interpretation which ad-mits borderline cases. This claim has been vigorously contested by proponents of many-valued and infinitely-valued (fuzzy)logic who argue that there is nothing particularly special about the tautologies and equivalences of classical logic requiringthem to be accorded special status above those of any other internally consistent logic. Indeed, they argue that admittingadditional truth-values fundamentally changes the semantics of the language so that we should not be surprised if theresulting logic has different tautologies and equivalences.VP4 requires that a disjunction should be not absolutely false when at least one of its disjuncts is not absolutely false.Furthermore, this should be the only manner in which a disjunction is not absolutely false. In other words, a disjunctionshould be absolutely false exactly when both of its disjuncts are absolutely false. Together with VP1, VP4 seems perhaps theleast controversial of the properties. VP5 again relates to disjunctions of sentences requiring that a disjunction is absolutelytrue exactly when at least one of its disjuncts is absolutely true. However, there is an inherent tension between this require-ment and VP2. To see this suppose that we have a valuation pair for which (cid:11)v(p) = (0, 1) and, as would be required byVP1, also (cid:11)v(¬p) = (0, 1). If in this case VP5 holds then v(p ∨ ¬p) = 0 contradicting VP2. Notice there is no problem herewith the requirement that a disjunction with at least one absolutely true disjunct is itself absolutely true, but rather withthe requirement that this is the only way in which a disjunction can be absolutely true. In other words, there is no tensionbetween VP2 and the weaker requirement that v(θ ∨ ϕ) (cid:3) max(v(θ), v(ϕ)). Finally, notice that assuming VP1 holds togetherwith de Morgan’s laws then VP4 and VP5 imply dual constraints on conjunctions of the form v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v(θ), v(ϕ))and ¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)) respectively.The following results show that VP1 through to VP4 provide a characterisation of supervaluation pairs.Theorem 9. If (cid:11)v ∈ V satisfies axioms VP1 through to VP4 then ∃∅ (cid:13)= P ⊆ 2P such that ∀θ ∈ SL, v(θ) = min{v F (θ): F ∈ P} and¯v(θ) = max{v F (θ): F ∈ P}, i.e. (cid:11)v is a supervaluation pair.Proof. Let P = {Fα j : ¯v(α j) = 1}. Notice that P (cid:13)= ∅ since if P = ∅ then by the definition of P we have that ∀α j , ¯v(α j) = 0⇒ by definition of valuation pairs v(α j) = 0. Therefore, by VP1 we for any atom α j that ¯v(¬α j) = 1. However, ¬α j ≡(cid:9)k(cid:13)= j αk and therefore by VP3 and VP4 we have that(cid:4)(cid:6)= max(cid:7)¯v(αk): k (cid:13)= j= 0¯v(¬α j) = ¯v(cid:3) (cid:5)αkk(cid:13)= jThis is a contradiction.Now suppose θ is a tautology then by VP2 it holds that (cid:11)v(θ) = (1, 1). Also ∀F ⊆ P it holds that v F (θ) = 1. Therefore,min{v F (θ): F ∈ P} = max{v F (θ): F ∈ P} = 1 as required. Now suppose θ is not a tautology so that Pθ (cid:13)= ∅ and P¬θ (cid:13)= ∅.We consider three cases:(cid:11)v(θ) = (0, 0)(cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:11)v(θ) = (0, 0) ⇒ (by VP3) (cid:11)vαF= (0, 0) ⇒ ¯vαF= 0F ∈Pθ(cid:7)¯v(αF ): F ∈ Pθ(cid:6)⇒ (by VP4) maxand hence by definition of P it follows thatPθ ∩ P = ∅ ⇒ ∀F ∈ P, v F (θ) = 0 ⇒ min= 0 ⇒ ∀F ∈ Pθ , ¯v(αF ) = 0(cid:6)v F (θ): F ∈ P(cid:7)(cid:6)= maxv F (θ): F ∈ P(cid:7)= 0(cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4)F ∈Pθas required.(cid:11)v(θ) = (0, 1)Suppose that ∀F ∈ P v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ P ⊆ Pθ ⇒ ∀F ∈ P c¯v(¬θ) = ¯vαF= max(cid:6)¯v(αF ): F ∈ P¬θ(cid:7)= 0 ⇒ v(θ) = 1 (by axiom VP1)(cid:3) (cid:5)(cid:4)F ∈P¬θθ (= P¬θ ), ¯v(αF ) = 0 (by the definition of P ). Now by VP3 and VP4J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4127This a contradiction and hence ∃F ∈ P , v F (θ) = 0 ⇒ min{v F (θ): F ∈ P} = 0 as required.Alternatively suppose that ∀F ∈ P , v F (θ) = 0 ⇒ ∀F ∈ P , v F (¬θ) = 1 ⇒ P ⊆ P¬θ ⇒ ∀F ∈ Pθ , ¯v(αF ) = 0 by definitionof P . Now by VP3 and VP4(cid:4)(cid:3) (cid:5)¯v(θ) = ¯vαF= max(cid:6)¯v(αF ): F ∈ Pθ(cid:7)= 0F ∈PθThis is a contradiction and therefore ∃F ∈ P, v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ max{v F (θ): F ∈ P} = 1 as required.(cid:11)v(θ) = (1, 1)Suppose ∃F ∈ P such that v F (θ) = 0 ⇒ ∃F ∈ P such that αF (cid:13)|(cid:9) θ (i.e. F ∈ P¬θ ) ⇒ ∃F ∈ P ∩ P¬θ ⇒ by the definition of Pthat ∃F ∈ P¬θ such that ¯v(αF ) = 1 ⇒ by VP3 and VP4 that¯v(¬θ) = max(cid:6)¯v(αF ): F ∈ P¬θ(cid:7)= 1⇒ v(θ) = 0 by VP1 which is a contradiction. Hence ∀F ∈ P, v F (θ) = 1(cid:6)⇒ minv F (θ): F ∈ Pv F (θ): F ∈ P= max= 1(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)as required. (cid:2)Corollary 10. A valuation pair (cid:11)v satisfies VP1 to VP4 if and only if (cid:11)v is a supervaluation pair.Proof. From Theorem 9 it only remains to show that supervaluation pairs satisfy VP1 to VP4. This follows trivially from thedefinition of supervaluation pairs. (cid:2)From our earlier discussions it is clear that supervaluation pairs do not, in general, satisfy VP5. This is because they dosatisfy VP2 and that there are clearly examples of supervaluation pairs for which (cid:11)v(p) = (cid:11)v(¬p) = (0, 1) for some proposi-tional variable p (e.g. take P = {{p}, ∅}).In the following results we show that, taken together with de Morgan’s laws, VP1, VP4 and VP5 provide a characterisationof Kleene valuation pairs.Theorem 11. If (cid:11)v ∈ V satisfies VP1, VP4, VP5 and de Morgan’s laws then (cid:11)v is a Kleene valuation pair.Proof. It is sufficient to show that ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL, v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v(θ), v(ϕ)) and ¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = min( ¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)). By VP1 ¯v(θ ∧ϕ) = 1 − v(¬(θ ∧ ϕ)) = 1 − v(¬θ ∨ ¬ϕ) by de Morgan’s laws = 1 − max(v(¬θ), v(¬ϕ)) by VP5 = 1 − max(1 − v(θ), 1 − v(ϕ))by VP1 = min(v(θ), v(ϕ)). The result for v(θ ∧ ϕ) follows similarly. (cid:2)Corollary 12. A valuation pair (cid:11)v ∈ V satisfies VP1, VP4, VP5 and de Morgan’s laws if and only if (cid:11)v is a Kleene valuation pair.Proof. From Theorem 11 and Definition 7 we need only show that Kleene valuation pairs satisfy de Morgan’s laws. This isproved in [23]. (cid:2)We now define semantic precision as a natural partial ordering on V. This concerns the situation in which one valuationpair admits more borderline cases than another but where otherwise their truth valuations agree. More formally, valuationpair (cid:11)v 1 is less semantically precise than (cid:11)v 2 if they disagree only for some set of sentences of L, which being identified aseither absolutely true or absolutely false by (cid:11)v 2, are classified as being borderline cases by (cid:11)v 1. In other words, (cid:11)v 1 is lesssemantically precise than (cid:11)v 2 if all of the absolutely true and absolutely false valuations of (cid:11)v 1 are preserved by (cid:11)v 2.Definition 13 (Semantic precision). ∀(cid:11)v 1, (cid:11)v 2 ∈ V, (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 if and only if ∀θ ∈ SL, v 1(θ) (cid:2) v 2(θ) and ¯v 1(θ) (cid:3) ¯v 2(θ).We might now think of the disagreement between two valuation pairs related by (cid:4) as intuitively being less than thatof two unrelated valuation pairs. Indeed, if (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 then another perspective is to think of (cid:11)v 2 being generated as a precisi-fication (in the general sense) of (cid:11)v 1 by, perhaps even arbitrarily, classifying some of the borderline cases identified by (cid:11)v 1as either being absolutely true or absolutely false. The following two results show alternative characterisations of semanticprecision both for Kleene valuation pairs and supervaluation pairs. In the latter case notice that (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 exactly when thefirst interpretation is a precisification of the second in the sense of Fine [10]. Indeed, Shapiro [35] proposes a version of thisordering for Kleene’s strong logic which be refers to as sharpening, where (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 means that (cid:11)v 2 extends or sharpens (cid:11)v 1.Theorem 14. (See [23].) ∀(cid:11)v 1, (cid:11)v 2 ∈ Vk, (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 if and only if {pi ∈ P : v 1(pi) = 1} ⊆ {pi ∈ P : v 2(pi) = 1} and {pi ∈ P : ¯v 1(pi) =1} ⊇ {pi ∈ P : ¯v 2(pi) = 1}.28J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41Theorem 15. ∀(cid:11)v 1, (cid:11)v 2 ∈ Vs, (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 if and only if P1 ⊇ P2 where P1 and P2 are the sets of admissible valuations for (cid:11)v 1 and (cid:11)v 2respectively.For Theorem 14 the proof follows trivially by induction on the complexity of sentences in SL, while Theorem 15 followsimmediately from the definition of supervaluation pairs.3.2. Relating Kleene and supervaluation pairsIn this section we investigate the relationship between Kleene valuation pairs and bounded supervaluation pairs. Inparticular, we will show that for every bounded supervaluation pair there is a less semantically precise Kleene valuationpair with the same values on the sets of entirely positive and entirely negative sentences of L. The following two initiallemmas prove useful nestedness properties for classical valuations when restricted to sentences in SL+and SL−.Lemma 16. If θ ∈ SL+and F ⊆ F(cid:18) ⊆ P then v F (θ) = 1 implies that v F (cid:18) (θ) = 1.Proof. Let SL+,0 = P and SL+,n = SL+,n−1 ∪ {θ ∧ ϕ, θ ∨ ϕ: θ, ϕ ∈ SL+,n−1}. Then by induction on n we have the following.(cid:18) ⇒ v F (cid:18) (pi) = 1. Now suppose Ψ ∈ SL+,n+1 then either Ψ ∈ SL+,n in whichFor pi ∈ P , v F (pi) = 1 ⇒ pi ∈ F ⇒ pi ∈ Fcase the result follows trivially or ∃θ, ϕ ∈ SL+,n and one of the following holds:• Ψ = θ ∧ ϕ: In this case v F (θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 ⇒ v F (θ) = 1 and v F (ϕ) = 1 ⇒ (by induction) v F (cid:18) (θ) = 1 and v F (cid:18) (ϕ) = 1• Ψ = θ ∨ ϕ: In this case v F (θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 ⇒ v F (θ) = 1 or v F (ϕ) = 1 ⇒ (by induction) v F (cid:18) (θ) = 1 or v F (cid:18) (ϕ) = 1 ⇒⇒ v F (cid:18) (θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 as required.v F (cid:18) (θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 as required. (cid:2)Lemma 17. If θ ∈ SL−and F(cid:18) ⊆ F ⊆ P then v F (θ) = 1 implies that v F (cid:18) (θ) = 1.Proof. The proof mirrors that of Lemma 16 but with induction on the complexity of sentences in SL−instead of SL+. (cid:2)The next result shows that for any bounded supervaluation pair its value on strictly positive or strictly negative sentencesis determined entirely from its lower and upper admissible valuations. In other words, it has the same value on SL+ ∪ SL−as the bounded supervaluation pair which admits only these lower and upper valuations.Theorem 18. Let (cid:11)v ∈ Vbs be a bounded supervaluation pair with lower and upper admissible valuations F and F and let (cid:11)vbounded supervaluation pair for which P (cid:18) = {F , F } then ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−, (cid:11)v(θ) = (cid:11)v(cid:18)(θ).(cid:18)be theProof. For θ ∈ SL+v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ ∃F ∈ P such that v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ ¯v(θ) = 1.: If ¯v(θ) = 1 ⇒ ∃F ∈ P such that v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ v F (θ) = 1 by Lemma 16 ⇒ ¯vIf v(θ) = 1 ⇒ ∀F ∈ P , v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ v F (θ) = 1 and v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ v(cid:18)(θ) = 1. Also, if v(cid:18)(θ) = 1 ⇒ v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ by Lemma 16(cid:18)(θ) = 1. Also, if ¯v(cid:18)(θ) = 1 ⇒∀F ∈ P , v F (θ) = 1 ⇒ v(θ) = 1.For θ ∈ SL−the result follows similarly from Lemma 17 by swapping the roles of F and F in the above argument. (cid:2)Notice, however, it is not generally the case that for θ ∈ SL − (SL+ ∪ SL−), (cid:11)v(θ) = (cid:11)v(cid:18)(θ) as can be seen from thefollowing example:Example 19. Let P = {{p1}, {p1, p2}, {p1, p2, p3}} so that P (cid:18) = {{p1}, {p1, p2, p3}}. In this case ¯v(p2 ∧¬p3) = 1 while ¯v¬p3) = 0.(cid:18)(p2 ∧We now show that for entirely positive and entirely negative sentences, bounded supervaluation pairs satisfy propertyVP5, i.e. that a disjunction is absolutely true exactly when at least one of its disjuncts is absolutely true. Furthermore, inthis case we also have the dual result that a conjunction is not absolutely false exactly when both of its conjuncts are notabsolutely false.Theorem 20. Let (cid:11)v ∈ Vbs be a bounded supervaluation pair then ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL+(cid:11)(cid:11)¯v(θ), ¯v(ϕ)v(θ), v(ϕ)(cid:10)¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = minand v(θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:10)and ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL−it holds that:Proof. As before let P (cid:18) = {F , F } then for θ, ϕ ∈ SL+Lemma 16 iff v F (θ) = 1 and v F (ϕ) = 1 iff ¯vas required.(cid:18)(θ) = 1 and ¯v, ¯v(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 iff ¯v(cid:18)(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 by Theorem 18 iff v F (θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 by(cid:18)(ϕ) = 1 by Lemma 16 iff ¯v(θ) = 1 and ¯v(ϕ) = 1 by Theorem 18J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4129Similarly, v(θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 iff v(cid:18)(θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 by Theorem 18, iff v F (θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 by Lemma 16 iff v F (θ) = 1 or v F (ϕ) = 1 iff(cid:18)(θ) = 1 or v(cid:18)(ϕ) = 1 by Lemma 16 iff v(θ) = 1 or v(ϕ) = 1 by Theorem 18 as required.vFor θ, ϕ ∈ SL−the result follows similarly from Lemma 17 by swapping the roles of F and F in the above argument. (cid:2)Theorem 21. Let (cid:11)vbs ∈ Vbs be a bounded supervaluation pair then there exists a unique Kleene valuation pair (cid:11)vk such that (cid:11)vk (cid:4) (cid:11)vbsand ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−, (cid:11)vk(θ) = (cid:11)vbs(θ).Proof. We define (cid:11)vk ∈ Vk such that ∀pi ∈ P let vk(pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ F and ¯vk(pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ F , where F and F are the lowerand upper sets of admissible valuations for (cid:11)vbs.Firstly, we show that ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−, and the result forfollows similarly. The proof is by induction as follows. For pi ∈ P the result follows trivially. Now suppose Ψ ∈ SL+,n+1SL−then either Ψ ∈ SL+,n in which case the result follows trivially or ∃θ, ϕ ∈ SL+,n and one of the following holds:, (cid:11)vk(θ) = (cid:11)vbs(θ). Here we prove this result for sentences in SL+• Ψ = θ ∧ ϕ: vk(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(vk(θ), vk(ϕ)) by definition of Kleene valuation pairs = min(vbs(θ), vbs(ϕ)) by the inductivehypothesis = vbs(θ ∧ ϕ) by a basic property of supervaluation pairs. Also, ¯vk(θ ∧ ϕ) = min( ¯vk(θ), ¯vk(ϕ)) by definitionof Kleene valuation pairs = min( ¯vbs(θ), ¯vbs(ϕ)) by the inductive hypothesis = ¯vbs(θ ∧ ϕ) by Theorem 20.• Ψ = θ ∨ ϕ: vk(θ ∨ϕ) = max(vk(θ), vk(ϕ)) by definition of Kleene valuation pairs = max(vbs(θ), vbs(ϕ)) by the inductivehypothesis = vbs(θ ∨ ϕ) by Theorem 20. Also, ¯vk(θ ∨ ϕ) = max( ¯vk(θ), ¯vk(ϕ)) by definition of Kleene valuation pairs= max( ¯vbs(θ), ¯vbs(ϕ)) by the inductive hypothesis = ¯vbs(θ ∨ ϕ) by a basic property of supervaluation pairs.To see that (cid:11)vk defined as above is the only Kleene valuation agreeing with (cid:11)vbs for all sentences in SL+ ∪ SL−∀pi ∈ P , (cid:11)vk(pi) = (cid:11)vbs(pi) then vk(pi) = 1 iff vbs(pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ F and ¯vk(pi) = 1 iff ¯vbs(pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ F .We now show that (cid:11)vk (cid:4) (cid:11)vbs, for (cid:11)vk defined as above. The proof is by induction as follows: If Ψ ∈ SL0 then Ψ = pi ∈ P .Clearly, by the definition of (cid:11)vk, (cid:11)vk(pi) = (cid:11)vbs(pi) and so the result follows trivially in this case. Now suppose Ψ ∈ SLn+1then either Ψ ∈ SLn in which case the result follows trivially or ∃θ, ϕ ∈ SLn such that one of the following holds:note that if• Ψ = θ ∧ ϕ: In this case, if vk(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 then min(vk(θ), vk(θ)) = 1 which implies that vk(θ) = 1 and vk(ϕ) = 1.Hence, by induction, vbs(θ) = 1 and vbs(ϕ) = 1 which implies that vbs(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 as required. Also, if ¯vbs(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1then ¯vbs(θ) = 1 and ¯vbs(ϕ) = 1 which implies, by induction, that ¯vk(θ) = 1 and ¯vk(ϕ) = 1. Hence, min( ¯vk(θ), ¯vk(ϕ)) =¯vk(θ ∧ ϕ) = 1 as required.• Ψ = θ ∨ϕ: In this case, if vk(θ ∨ϕ) = 1 then max(vk(θ), vk(θ)) = 1 which implies that vk(θ) = 1 or vk(ϕ) = 1. Hence, byinduction, vbs(θ) = 1 or vbs(ϕ) = 1 which implies that vbs(θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 as required. Also, if ¯vbs(θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 then ¯vbs(θ) = 1or ¯vbs(ϕ) = 1 which implies, by induction, that ¯vk(θ) = 1 or ¯vk(ϕ) = 1. Hence, max( ¯vk(θ), ¯vk(ϕ)) = ¯vk(θ ∨ ϕ) = 1 asrequired.• Ψ = ¬θ : In this case, if vk(¬θ) = 1 then ¯vk(θ) = 0, which implies, by induction, that ¯vbs(θ) = 0. Hence, vbs(¬θ) = 1as required. Also, if ¯vbs(¬θ) = 1 then vbs(θ) = 0 which implies, by induction, that vk(θ) = 0. Hence, ¯vk(¬θ) = 1 asrequired. (cid:2)There are a number of different possible viewpoints from which we can interpret Theorem 21. One perspective might bethat in some sense bounded supervaluation pairs provide a better model of truth-gaps than Kleene valuation pairs, perhapson the basis of the axiomatic characterisations given in Section 3.1. In this case we could view the Kleene valuation pair (cid:11)vkidentified in Theorem 21 as a less semantically precise approximation of (cid:11)vbs, agreeing with (cid:11)vbs on an important subclassof sentences. Such an approximation might be advantageous on computational grounds because Kleene valuation pairs aretruth-functional, while bounded supervaluation pairs are not even functional in a weaker sense. We will consider this issuein more detail in the following section.An alternative perspective would be to simply view Kleene valuation pair (cid:11)vk as a more vague interpretation of L forwhich Theorem 21 identifies a set of bounded supervaluation pairs as different precisifications. More formally, given Kleenevaluation pair (cid:11)vk ∈ Vk for which F = {pi: vk(pi) = 1} and F = {pi: ¯vk(pi) = 1} then we can identify the class of boundedsupervaluation pairs with lower and upper admissible valuations F and F , given by:(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)= F ,[[F , F ]] =(cid:11)vbs ∈ Vbs:pi: ¯vbs(pi) = 1Now Theorem 21 identifies the same Kleene valuation pair (cid:11)vk for each bounded supervaluation pair in [[F , F ]]. Hence, wemight think of [[F , F ]] as a natural class of precisifications of (cid:11)vk.pi: vbs(pi) = 1Interestingly, the class [[F , F ]] also provides us with some insight into the relationship between bounded supervaluationpairs and complete bounded supervaluation pairs. Notice that as F ⊆ F range across all possible such pairs of subsets of P ,then the sets [[F , F ]] form a partition of Vbs. Also, each complete bounded supervaluation pair (cid:11)vcbs ∈ Vcbs is a member ofexactly one of these sets. In fact, if (cid:11)vcbs has lower and upper admissible valuations F and F then (cid:11)vcbs ∈ [[F , F ]] and byTheorem 15 ∀(cid:11)vbs ∈ [[F , F ]], (cid:11)vcbs (cid:4) (cid:11)vbs. Hence, ∀θ ∈ SL,= Fvcbs(θ) = min(cid:6)(cid:7)vbs(θ): (cid:11)vbs ∈ [[F , F ]]and ¯vcbs(θ) = max(cid:6)(cid:7)¯vbs(θ): (cid:11)vbs ∈ [[F , F ]]30J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41Also notice by Theorem 18 that (cid:11)vcbs agrees with all the valuation pairs in [[F , F ]] on the sentences in SL+ ∪ SL−. Hence,in summary, we have that for every partition set of bounded supervaluation pairs [[F , F ]] there are both a unique Kleenevaluation pair and a unique complete bounded supervaluation pair which are less semantically precise than all the valuationpairs in this set, but which agree with all of them on the sentences of SL+ ∪ SL−.In the following section we consider the representational power of supervaluation pairs, bounded and complete boundedsupervaluation pairs, and Kleene valuation pairs, with particular regard to penumbral connections.3.3. Penumbral connectionsFine [10] highlights the capacity to capture penumbral connections as a significant advantage of supervaluationist the-ories of vagueness over many-valued logics. Penumbral connections are defined to be those ‘logical relations [that] holdbetween indefinite sentences’ [10]. In particular, given a set of borderline literals, penumbral connections may ensure thatcertain conjunctions or disjunctions of these literals are nonetheless absolutely true or absolutely false. For example, sup-pose we have a sequence of heights h1 < h2 < · · · < hn where only h1 is classed as being absolutely not tall, and onlyhn is absolutely tall, so that all other heights are borderline cases of tall. However, despite their borderline status, if wewere to learn that hi was indeed tall for any i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 1} we would immediately infer that hi+1 was also tall, sim-ply because hi+1 > hi . More formally, let pi denote the proposition ‘a person of height hi is tall’ then we can capture theabove penumbral connections by the supervaluation pair where P = {{p2, . . . , pn}, . . . ,{ pi, . . . , pn}, . . . ,{ pn−1, pn}, {pn}}. Inthis case, (cid:11)v(p1) = (0, 0), (cid:11)v(pn) = (1, 1) and (cid:11)v(pi) = (0, 1) for i = 2, . . . , n − 1. Furthermore, (cid:11)v(pi → pi+1) = (1, 1)4 fori = 1, . . . , n − 1. Notice that this is a bounded supervaluation pair with F = {pn} and F = {p2, . . . , pn} but it is not a com-plete bounded supervaluation pair. Indeed, the complete bounded supervaluation pair generated by F and F as above, wouldloose the semantic information about the penumbral connections between p1, . . . , pn since it would, by definition, containother admissible valuations consistent with pi ∧ ¬p j for j > i.Another type of penumbral connections concerns two propositional variables which are exclusive and exhaustive, butwhere both are borderline cases. Fine [10] uses the example of colours red and pink, suggesting that a given object on theborderline of these two colours must nonetheless be described as one or the other but not both. Suppose then that wehave two borderline propositions p1 and p2, for which p1 ∧ p2 is absolutely false and p1 ∨ p2 is absolutely true. In orderfor a supervaluation pair to capture this semantic information we would require the following: 1) ∀F ∈ P either p1 ∈ F orp2 ∈ F but {p1, p2} (cid:2) F , and 2) ∃F , F. However, a set of admissible valuations with these¯v(pi) = 1}, it followsproperties cannot define a bounded supervaluation pair. To see this notice that taking F = {pi ∈ P :that {p1, p2} ⊆ F and therefore F /∈ P .(cid:18) ∈ P such that p1 ∈ F and p2 ∈ F(cid:18)The above examples provide some illustration of the loss of representational power resulting from restricting generalsupervaluation pairs to either bounded or complete bounded supervaluation pairs. Whilst Corollary 10 means that anypenumbral connections resulting from classical equivalences, tautologies or contradictions can be captured by all super-valuation pairs, restricting ourselves to bounded and then complete bounded supervaluation pairs successively limits thetype of penumbral connections which can be captured. Kleene valuation pairs have even less capacity for representingthe type of penumbral connections we have outlined here. Indeed, even connections represented by classical equiva-lences, tautologies and contradictions cannot in general be captured. For example, there is no Kleene valuation pair where(cid:11)v(θ) = (cid:11)v(¬θ) = (0, 1) but where (cid:11)v(θ ∧ ¬θ) = (0, 0) and (cid:11)v(θ ∨ ¬θ) = (1, 1). In the next section, however, we will arguethat, despite the reduction in capacity for representing penumbral connections, there are some computational advantage ofrestricting ourselves to bounded or complete bounded supervaluation pairs, or indeed even to Kleene valuation pairs.3.4. Functionality and truth-functionality of valuation pairsTruth-functionality or compositionality is a fundamental aspect of most classical formal systems. The truth-value of anycompound expression, it is assumed, can be determined from the truth-values of its components by means of a recursiveprocess dependent of the logical structure of that expression. This provides a computationally feasible method for determin-ing truth-values with a computational cost bounded by the number of independent occurrences of connectives in the givenformula. Furthermore, an agent is only required to identify truth-values for the primitives in the language; in this case thepropositional variables.In this section we consider the issue of truth-functionality for valuation pairs together with a weaker form of functional-ity. For the latter, rather than assuming that valuations are determined from mappings based directly around the connectivesof the language, we require only that, for each sentence θ , a function can be identified which determines the valuation of θon the basis of the valuations for the propositional variables only. Such an assumption restricts the necessity of direct truthevaluations to the propositional variables which can at least potentially limit an agent’s storage (or memory) requirements.However, as we shall see the computational cost of evaluating a sentence can, in the worst case, remain high.4 Here pi → p j is used as shorthand for ¬pi ∨ p j .The following are formal definitions of both functionality and truth-functionality for a class V(cid:18) ⊆ V of valuation pairs.J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4131Definition 22 (Functionality). Let T = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)}. Then a class of valuation pairs V(cid:18) ⊆ V is functional if ∀θ ∈ SLthere exists a function fθ : Tn → T such that:∀(cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18),(cid:11)v(θ) = fθ(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)v(p1), . . . , (cid:11)v(pn)Definition 23 (Truth-functionality). A class of valuation pairs V(cid:18) ⊆ V is truth-functional if there are functions f∧ : T2 → T,f∨ : T2 → T and f¬ : T → T such that ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL and ∀(cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18):(cid:11)v(¬θ) = f¬(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)v(θ),(cid:11)v(θ ∧ ϕ) = f∧(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)v(θ), (cid:11)v(ϕ),and (cid:11)v(θ ∨ ϕ) = f∨(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)v(θ), (cid:11)v(ϕ)Naturally any class of valuation pairs which are truth-functional are also functional. For example, Kleene valuation pairsare truth-functional. However, the following example shows that in general supervaluation pairs are not functional.Example 24. Let P = {p1, p2, p3} and (cid:11)v 1 and (cid:11)v 2 be supervaluation pairs with sets of admissible valuations P1 ={{p1}, {p2}, {p3}} and P2 = {{p1, p2}, {p3}} respectively. Now for both (cid:11)v 1 and (cid:11)v 2 we have that (cid:11)v 1(p1) = (cid:11)v 2(p1) = (0, 1),(cid:11)v 1(p2) = (cid:11)v 2(p2) = (0, 1) and (cid:11)v 1(p3) = (cid:11)v 2(p3) = (0, 1). But (cid:11)v 1(p1 ∧ p2) = (0, 0) while (cid:11)v 2(p1 ∧ p2) = (0, 1).In fact it is not even the case that the restricted class of bounded supervaluation pairs are functional as can be seenfrom the following example:Example 25. Let P = {p1, p2, p3} and (cid:11)v 1 and (cid:11)v 2 be bounded supervaluation pairs with sets of admissible valuations P1 ={{p1}, {p1, p2}, {p1, p2, p3}} and P2 = {{p1}, {p1, p3}, {p1, p2, p3}} respectively. For both (cid:11)v 1 and (cid:11)v 2 we have that (cid:11)v 1(p1) =(cid:11)v 2(p1) = (1, 1), (cid:11)v 1(p2) = (cid:11)v 2(p2) = (0, 1) and (cid:11)v 1(p3) = (cid:11)v 2(p3) = (0, 1). However, for θ = p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 we have that (cid:11)v 1(θ) =(0, 1) while (cid:11)v 2(θ) = (0, 0).On the other hand, complete bounded supervaluation pairs are functional as we can see from the following argument: If(cid:11)v ∈ Vcbs then if we know (cid:11)v(pi) for i = 1, . . . , n then we can determine the lower and upper admissible valuations accordingto:(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:7)F =pi: v(pi) = 1and F =and consequently we can define for any θ ∈ SL, fθ : Tn → T such that:(cid:6)min(cid:11)(cid:11)v(p1), . . . , (cid:11)v(pn)v F (θ): F ⊆ F ⊆ Fpi: ¯v(pi) = 1, max=(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:10)fθv F (θ): F ⊆ F ⊆ F(cid:7)(cid:11)However, as the next result shows, no class of supervaluation pairs which strictly extends classical valuations is truth-functional.Theorem 26. Let Vc ⊂ V(cid:18) ⊆ Vs then the class of supervaluation pairs V(cid:18)is not truth-functional.Proof. Since V(cid:18) ⊃ Vc then there exists (cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18)assume that ∃pi ∈ F such that pi /∈ F(0, 0). Hence, V(cid:18)is not truth-functional. (cid:2)(cid:18)with admissible valuations P ⊇ {F , F. Now w.l.o.g. we can. Hence, (cid:11)v(pi) = (0, 1), (cid:11)v(¬pi) = (0, 1) but (cid:11)v(pi ∧ pi) = (0, 1) while (cid:11)v(pi ∧ ¬pi) =(cid:18)} where F (cid:13)= F(cid:18)Given all of the above we can now consider the computational cost of truth evaluations for different classes of valuationpairs, from the perspective of the functionality and truth-functionality properties. If a sentence θ has m distinct occurrencesof the connectives then for any truth-functional class V(cid:18)the computational cost of evaluating (cid:11)v(θ) is O(m).5 For non-truth-functional V(cid:18)this cost can be much higher. For example, if (cid:11)v ∈ Vs then the cost of evaluating (cid:11)v(θ) is, in the worst case,O(m|P|), i.e. the combined cost of evaluating the truth-value of θ for every admissible classical valuation in P .6 Indeed,this is also true for complete bounded supervaluation pairs, even though their functionality means that P does not needto be stored directly but can be determined from the valuations on propositional variables. However, these are worst casecosts and in many situations evaluating valuation pairs can be much more computationally feasible. For instance, noticethat from Theorem 20 it follows that for sentences restricted to SL+bounded supervaluation pairs are effectivelytruth-functional with f∧ = min and f∨ = max. Also, recall from Theorem 21 that any bounded supervaluation pair can be‘approximated’ by a semantically less precise but fully truth-functional Kleene valuation pair.or SL−5 This is of course assuming no cost for evaluating the connective functions f¬, f∧ and f∨.6 This worst case occurs when determining the valuation pair values of a sentence θ which is either absolutely true or absolutely false. In such a casethe truth-value of θ must be calculated for every admissible valuation in P , with a cost for each valuation dependent on the number of connectives in θ .32J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–414. Bipolar belief measuresRecall, as discussed in Section 2, that there is a clear distinction between indeterminism and epistemic uncertainty. Forvague concepts, truth-gaps are an integral part of the underlying truth-model and do not result from lack of knowledgeabout any of the relevant attributes involved in the concept definitions. In particular, borderline cases do not model uncer-tainty, and indeed an agent can be certain that a particular proposition is a borderline case. For example, a given heightmay definitely be a borderline case of the predicate tall. Similarly, learning that the proposition ‘Bill is tall’ is borderlineis informative since it suggests that Bill’s height is a borderline case of the concept tall and hence provides informationabout its actual value. On the other hand, learning that the truth-value of ‘Bill is tall’ is uncertain or unknown providesno information about Bill’s height. Hence, from this perspective, valuation pairs provide a truth-model incorporating truth-gaps and not a three-valued representation of uncertainty. This is in contrast to a significant proportion of the literature onthree-valued logic which tends to use the third truth-value to represent ‘unknown’ [6].In view of the above distinction, it is natural to propose a combined model incorporating both indeterminism andepistemic uncertainty in order to represent an agent’s subjective beliefs concerning sentences which involve vague concepts.In the sequel we will argue that this model should be characterised by a probability distribution over a set of possiblevaluations. This will then result in lower and upper (bipolar) measures of subjective belief on the sentences of L, as outlinedbelow. Now, in practice, there are many different sources of epistemic uncertainty that will influence an agent’s belief aboutSL. However, here we suggest that one natural division of uncertainty types is as follows:• Semantic uncertainty: This takes the form of uncertainty about the linguistic conventions governing the assertability ofsentences of L. In other words, uncertainty about what is the correct interpretation of L. For example, an agent maybe uncertain as to whether or not a proposition such as ‘Ethel is tall’ is definitely or acceptably assertable even if theyknow Ethel’s height precisely. One would expect this type of uncertainty to be a natural consequence of the distributedmanner in which an agent learns language through communications with other individuals across a population ofinteracting agents.• Possible worlds uncertainty: This type of uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge concerning the current state ofthe world and in particular about the referents of sentences in L. For example, an agent may not know Ethel’s heightprecisely and hence be uncertain about the truth-value of the proposition ‘Ethel is tall’. Another way of viewing thisis that the agent has identified a set of possible worlds, perhaps corresponding to different possible values for Ethel’sheight, but where he/she is uncertain as to which of these correspond to the actual world.The second of these uncertainty types would seem to be consistent with the conventional understanding of epistemicuncertainty. In contrast, the treatment of semantic uncertainty as a form of epistemic uncertainty perhaps requires somejustification. In our view semantic uncertainty is another important aspect of vagueness in language, but one which is bestunderstood in terms of a lack of knowledge concerning the underlying conventions of the language. By adopting this viewwe are, in effect, assuming that each agent believes in the existence of a coherent set of rules governing the assertabilityof the sentences of L, which they should adhere to in order to communicate effectively with other agents. In other words,agents make the assumption that there is a correct interpretation of the language L.7 This would seem to bring us close tothe epistemic theory of vagueness as expounded by Timothy Williamson [44]. The epistemic theory of vagueness assumesthat for the extension of a vague concept there is a precise but unknown dividing boundary between it and the extensionof its negation. For example, consider the set of heights which are classified as being tall, then according to the epistemictheory there is a precise but unknown height threshold (cid:7) for which all heights less than (cid:7) are not tall and all those greaterthan or equal to (cid:7) are tall.While there are marked similarities between the epistemic theory of vagueness and the notion of semantic uncertaintyoutlined above, there are also some important differences. In the first instance the epistemic view assumes that the under-lying interpretation of the language is classical, while in the sequel we will assume that it may admit truth-gaps by, forexample, taking the form of a valuation pair. Perhaps more importantly though, the epistemic theory would seem to assumethe existence of some objectively correct interpretation of L which is not necessarily correlated with language use.8 Instead,we adopt the more pragmatic view that individuals, when faced with decision problems about assertions, find it useful aspart of decision making strategy to simply assume that there is a correct interpretation of L. In other words, when decidingwhat can be asserted agents behave as if the epistemic theory is correct. In earlier work we have referred to this strategicassumption across a population of agents as the epistemic stance [19], a concise statement of which is as follows:Each individual agent in the population assumes the existence of a correct set of language conventions, governing whatcan appropriately (or truthfully) be asserted given a particular state of the world.7 Although there is no requirement that this should be a classical interpretation.8 While this is true of the epistemic theory in general, it is perhaps worth noting that Williamson does assume that the correctness of one particularinterpretation is determined by the usage of speakers. Many thanks to one of the anonymous referees for this observation.J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4133Of course, in practice such conventions would not be imposed by some outside authority. Indeed, they may not exist at allin a single centralised form. Rather they are represented as a distributed body of knowledge concerning the interpretationof concepts in various cases, shared across a population of agents, and emerging as the result of interactions and commu-nications between individual agents all adopting the epistemic stance. The idea is that the learning processes of individualagents, all sharing the fundamental aim of understanding how words can be appropriately used to communicate informa-tion, will eventually converge to some degree on a set of shared conventions.9 The very process of convergence would thento some extent vindicate the epistemic stance from the perspective of individual agents.4.1. An integrated probabilistic uncertainty modelHere we propose an integrated treatment of both the types of epistemic uncertainty described above, but with theadditional assumption that interpretations of L may admit truth-gaps, i.e. that they correspond to valuation pairs. Let Sdenote the different possible states of the world (or alternatively the set of possible worlds). A language convention c isthen viewed as a function which maps from states of the world to truth valuations on L. Hence, in the current context,a language convention is a function c : S → V from states of the world to valuation pairs. Let C denote the set of suchconventions. Naturally, further restrictions of this definition may then be considered such as c : S → Vs or c : S → Vkdepending on the class of valuation pairs considered as providing the appropriate form of truth-model for L. For example, aconvention c could be associated with a particular pair of lower and upper thresholds (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) on height for the concept short.Whereas a state of the world σ ∈ S would be associated with a particular height value h for Ethel. The proposition ‘Ethelis short’ would then be absolutely true for those convention state pairs (c, σ ) for which h (cid:2) (cid:7) and not necessarily false inthose for which h (cid:2) (cid:7). From this perspective, sentences of the language relate to the objective state of the world, but thisrelationship is based on linguistic conventions which may be vague in the sense of admitting borderline cases. Hence thetruth (or falsity) of propositions depends on both the state of the world and the linguistic conventions according to whichthe relevant concepts are defined relative to the different possible states of the world S. A model of epistemic uncertaintyintegrating both the uncertainty types can therefore be defined in terms of a probability measure P on subsets of the crossproduct space C × S of linguistic conventions with world states. Such a model naturally generates a probability distributionon valuation pairs given by:w((cid:11)v) = P(cid:10)(cid:6)(c, σ ): c(σ ) = (cid:11)v(cid:7)(cid:11)From this we can naturally define lower and upper measures μ (cid:2) ¯μ such that for θ ∈ SL, μ(θ) is the probability of avaluation pair in which θ is absolutely true, while ¯μ(θ) is the probability of a valuation pair in which θ is not absolutelyfalse. That is:(cid:10)(cid:6)μ(θ) = w(cid:11)v: v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)and¯μ(θ) = w(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:11)v: ¯v(θ) = 1This formulation would seem to have significant overlap with that of Lassiter [18], who has proposed a model of linguisticvagueness defined on the cross-product space of possible worlds with possible languages. However, Lassiter’s approach onlyrefers to uncertainty about ‘precise languages’ suggesting that he is assuming a classical underlying truth-model. In thisrespect, his work is strongly related to probabilistic interpretations of fuzzy sets (see [8] for an overview), in which a fuzzyconcept is defined by a probability distribution on possible crisp set definitions. On the other hand, we argue that a bipolarmodel combining epistemic uncertainty with truth-gaps provides extra flexibility in decision making as well as helping toexplain why it may sometimes be optimal for an agent to choose to assert a vague statement rather than a semanticallysimilar crisp one. In Section 5 we will expand on this claim, however, initially we formally develop the notion of bipolarbelief pairs.4.2. Belief pairs from probability distributions on valuation pairsIn this section we consider bipolar belief measures on SL as generated from probability distributions defined on valua-tion pairs. The motivation for this approach comes from the idea outlined in Section 4.1 that epistemic uncertainty has botha semantic and stochastic element, naturally resulting in probability distributions on valuation pairs when these provide thepossible valuations of the language L. In particular, we will focus on Kleene and supervaluation pairs and investigate someof the resulting bipolar uncertainty measures on SL and their properties.Definition 27 (Supervaluation Belief Pair). Let w : Vs → [0, 1] be a probability distribution on Vs (i.e. the set of all super-valuation pairs on L) then the Supervaluation Belief Pair (SBP) generated by w is a pair of lower and upper measures(cid:11)μs,w = (μs,w , ¯μs,w )10 defined by: ∀θ ∈ SL9 This kind of convergent process has been shown to take place in various agent-based simulations of language games. See, for example, Steels andBelpaeme [37].10 As with valuation pairs the notation (cid:11)μ = (μ, ¯μ) refers to values of a lower and an upper belief measure and not an interval of possible values for asingle belief measure.34J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41(cid:10)(cid:6)μs,w (θ) = w(cid:11)v ∈ Vs: v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)and¯μs,w (θ) = w(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v ∈ Vs: ¯v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)We refer to SBPs where w is non-zero only on Vbs as Bounded Supervaluation Belief Pairs (BSBP) which are thendenoted by (cid:11)μbs,w = (μbs,w , ¯μbs,w ). Similarly, BSBPs where w is non-zero only on Vcbs are referred to as Complete BoundedSupervaluation Belief Pairs (CBSBP) and denoted by (cid:11)μcbs,w = (μcbs,w , ¯μcbs,w ).(cid:12)Notice that for SBPs we can define a mass function on sets of valuations m : 22P → [0, 1] where m(∅) = 0 andP⊆2P m(P) = 1 such that ∀(cid:11)v ∈ Vs,Fα j : ¯v(α j) = 1= w((cid:11)v)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:6)mNotice that in this case:(cid:13)P⊆Pθμs,w (θ) =m(P) and¯μs,w (θ) =(cid:13)m(P)P∩Pθ (cid:13)=∅Hence, μs,w and ¯μs,w are Dempster–Shafer belief and plausibility measures on SL respectively [34]. Notice, in the case thatw : Vs → [0, 1] is non-zero on {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr} and where (cid:11)v i is generated by the set of admissible valuations Pi which can beordered such that Pi ⊇ Pi+1 where i = 1, . . . , r − 1, then μs,w and ¯μs,w are necessity and possibility measures respectivelyand hence: ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL,(cid:10)μs,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = min(cid:11)μs,w (θ), μs,w (ϕ)(cid:10)¯μs,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)μs,w (θ), ¯μs,w (ϕ)andNotice from Theorem 15 that μs,w and ¯μs,w are necessity and possibility measures exactly when w is non-zero only on aset of supervaluation pairs which can be totally ordered according to the semantic precision relation. In effect, in this casethe agent’s uncertainty is restricted to a lack of knowledge about exactly how semantically precise the correct interpretationof L should be.We now define belief pairs for the case when the underlying truth-model is that of Kleene valuation pairs.Definition 28 (Kleene Belief Pair). Let w : Vk → [0, 1] be a probability distribution on Vk (i.e. the set of all Kleene valuationpairs on L) then the Kleene Belief Pair (KBP) generated by w is a pair of lower and upper measures (cid:11)μk,w = (μk,w , ¯μk,w )defined by: ∀θ ∈ SL(cid:10)(cid:6)μk,w (θ) = w(cid:11)v ∈ Vk: v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)and¯μk,w (θ) = w(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v ∈ Vk: ¯v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)Unsurprisingly, the properties of belief pairs are fundamentally constrained by the properties of the underlying valuationpairs. For example, it follows immediately that belief pairs which are defined in terms of valuation pairs satisfying VP1,including both SBP and KBP, also satisfy duality in that ∀θ ∈ SL, μ(¬θ) = 1 − ¯μ(θ), and vice-versa. In the sequel we willinvestigate the properties of supervaluation belief pairs and Kleene belief pairs in the light of the results given in Section 3.2relating Kleene and bounded supervaluation pairs in the context of the semantic precision relation. Initially, however, wepropose an operational justification for the definition of belief pairs in terms of probability distributions on valuation pairsby introducing an extension of de Finetti’s betting semantics for subjective probability.4.3. Betting semantics for belief pairsInspired by the operationalism movement in physics de Finetti [4] proposed betting behaviour as an operational seman-tics for subjective probability. In this section we employ a generalisation of de Finetti’s result due to Paris [28] in order togive a betting interpretation of belief pairs as defined in Section 4.2. This will require a short initial digression in order tooutline de Finetti’s basic idea.The motivation behind de Finetti’s approach was to provide a mechanism for eliciting a number in [0, 1] quantifying anagent’s belief in a sentence θ by requiring them to decide whether or not to accept a series of bets involving θ . It can thenbe shown that in order for the agent to avoid situations of sure loss, referred to as Dutch books, an agent’s quantitativebeliefs must then conform to the axioms of probability theory. More formally, we can identify a bet by triple (s, α, θ) whereθ ∈ SL is the statement on which we are betting, s ∈ R is the stake which can be either positive or negative, and α ∈ [0, 1]is the odds. Accepting or buying this bet then means agreeing to the following terms:• pay s × α,• for which you will receive £s if θ is true and receive £0 if θ is false.Note that if s < 0 you are effectively selling the bet instead of buying it. Now supposing that the classical valuation v ∈ Vc isrepresentative of the true state of the world combined with the correct language convention then the gain from bet (s, α, θ)is s(v(θ) − α). Consequently, if language conventions are such that only classical valuation occur for any state of the worldthen a Dutch book can be defined as a set of bets (si, αi, θi): i = 1, . . . , m such that ∀v ∈ Vc ,i=1 si(v(θi) − αi) < 0.(cid:12)mJ. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4135Given this we are now able to define a rational agent as follows: Let μ : SL → [0, 1] be a function representing aagent’s quantitative beliefs about the sentences of L. Suppose μ is determined so that for all sentences θ , μ(θ) is thevalue for which the agent will accept the bet (s, μ(θ), θ) for any stake s ∈ R, i.e. μ(θ) represents the odds for which theagent will bet on θ no matter what the value of the stake. In this case an agent will accept any set of bets of the form(si, μ(θi), θi): i = 1, . . . , m and consequently it is desirable that no such sequence should be a Dutch book. Hence, a rationalagent is one for whom their belief function μ is defined in such a way that no set of sentences of this form is a Dutchbook. de Finetti’s famous theorem shows that, according to this definition, an agent is rational if and only if their belief is aprobability measure on SL.Now the above argument assumes that the underlying truth-model is classical. We now consider the consequences ofallowing truth-gaps by assuming that the set of possible truth-models is a finite set of valuation pairs V(cid:18) ⊆ V which satisfythe duality principle VP1. In this case it is natural to define both lower and upper bets where the lower bet is dependenton the sentence involved being absolutely true while the upper bet requires only that it is not absolutely false. Hence, let(s, α, θ)∗ denote the lower bet:• pay s × α• receive £s if θ is absolutely true and receive £0 if θ is not absolutely truewhile (s, α, θ)∗denotes the upper bet:• pay s × α• receive £s if θ is not absolutely false and receive £0 if θ is absolutely falseIf (cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18)is the valuation pair representing the true state of the world combined with the correct language interpretationthen the gain from (s, α, θ)∗ is s(v(θ) − α) while that of (s, α, θ)∗is s( ¯v(θ) − α). An obvious consequence of this is thatif s (cid:3) 0 then the gain from (s, α, θ)∗is always greater than or equal to that of (s, α, θ)∗ while if s < 0 then the situationis reversed. Consequently a rational agent should always prefer to buy upper bets and sell lower bets whenever possible.Furthermore, the duality property VP1 implies a strong relationship between lower and upper bets as follows: Notice, thatthe gain for lower bet (s, α, ¬θ)∗ is s(v(¬θ) − α) = s(1 − ¯v(θ) − α) = −s( ¯v(θ) − (1 − α)) which is the same as the gain forthe upper bet (−s, 1 − α, θ)∗. Consequently, these two bets should be viewed as equivalent since a rational agent shouldbe willing to accept (s, α, ¬θ)∗ if and only if they are also willing to accept (−s, 1 − α, θ)∗. In other words, for any stake arational agent should be equally willing to buy a lower bet on θ at a given odds and sell an upper bet on ¬θ at one minusthose odds, and vice-versa.We now adopt an operational model in which an agent’s beliefs are quantified by a belief pair (cid:11)μ where for any sentenceθ , μ(θ) corresponds to the odds at which the agent is prepared to accept the lower bet (s, α, θ)∗ for any stake s ∈ R, while¯μ(θ) is the odds at which the agent will accept the upper bet (s, α, θ)∗for any stake s ∈ R. Notice immediately from theabove duality argument that the two bets (s, μ(¬θ), ¬θ)∗ and (−s, 1 − μ(¬θ), θ)∗are equally acceptable for any s ∈ R andhence ¯μ(θ) = 1 − μ(¬θ).Now in this extended context a Dutch book is a combined set of lower and upper bets (si, αi, θi)∗: i = 1, . . . , r and(s j, α j, θ j)∗j = r + 1, . . . , m for m (cid:3) r such that ∀(cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18),:(cid:10)sir(cid:13)i=1v(θi) − αim(cid:13)(cid:11)+(cid:10)s j¯v(θ j) − α j(cid:11)< 0j=r+1However, from the duality relationship described above we can restrict our attention to Dutch books involving only lowerj = r + 1, . . . , m is a Dutch book if and only if the setbets since the set (si, αi, θi)∗::(si, αi, θi)∗: i = 1, . . . , r and (−s j, 1 − α j, ¬θ j)∗:i = 1, . . . , r and (s j, α j, θ j)∗j = r + 1, . . . , m is a Dutch book.Theorem 29. An agent is rational (in the sense of avoiding Dutch books comprised of lower and upper bets) if and only if ∀θ ∈ SL,(cid:10)(cid:6)μ(θ) = w(cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18): v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)and¯μ(θ) = w(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18): ¯v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)where w is a probability distribution on V(cid:18).Proof. Paris [28] proved the following: Let B be a finite set of binary functions on SL. Here we are assuming that B is theset of possible truth-models for L, so that if b ∈ B is the true valuation then the gain from the bet (s, α, θ) is s(b(θ) − α).Also, let μ : SL → [0, 1] denote the odds for which the bet (s, α, θ) is acceptable for all s ∈ R. Then there is no set of bets(si, b(θi), θi): i = 1, . . . , m for which ∀b ∈ B,(cid:10)(cid:11)b(θi) − μ(θi)si< 0m(cid:13)i=136J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41if and only if μ is a convex linear combinations of functions in B i.e. ∀θ ∈ SL, μ(θ) = w({b ∈ B: b(θ) = 1}) where w is aprobability distribution on B.Now from the above we know that a belief pair (cid:11)μ avoids Dutch books involving lower and upper bets if and only ifthe lower measure μ avoids Dutch books comprised only of lower bets. Hence, the result follows immediately from Paris’theorem by taking B = {v: (cid:11)v ∈ V(cid:18)} and from the duality between μ and ¯μ. (cid:2)Clearly then Theorem 29 provides an added justification for Definitions 27 and 28 by taking V(cid:18) = Vs and V(cid:18) = Vkrespectively. That is, if the underlying truth-models of L are supervaluation pairs or Kleene valuation pairs, then a rationalagent should respectively adopt supervaluation belief pairs or Kleene belief pairs as their subjective belief model in orderto avoid Dutch books comprised of sets of lower and upper bets.4.4. Belief pairs and semantic precisionWe now investigate the properties of belief pairs relative to the semantic precision partial ordering on valuation pairs.The aim is to highlight certain classes of belief pairs which provide computationally efficient models under particularlyrestricted uncertainty conditions. We begin by extending Theorem 21 so as to show a natural relationship between boundedsupervaluation belief pairs and Kleene belief pairs.Theorem 30. For any BSBP (cid:11)μbs,w there is a KBP (cid:11)μk,w(cid:18) such that ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−μbs,w (θ) and ¯μk,w(cid:18) (θ) (cid:3) ¯μbs,w (θ)., (cid:11)μbs,w (θ) = (cid:11)μk,w(cid:18) (θ) and ∀θ ∈ SL, μk,w(cid:18) (θ) (cid:2)Proof. By Theorem 21 there exists a function g : Vbs → Vk such that g((cid:11)vbs) = (cid:11)vk where vk(pi) = 1 iff pi ∈ F and ¯vk(pi) = 1iff pi ∈ F for F ⊆ F the lower and upper admissible valuations of (cid:11)vbs and where ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−, and ∀(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs, (cid:11)v and g((cid:11)v)agree on θ .Now given BSBP (cid:11)μbs,w generated by probability distribution w on Vbs we define the distribution won Vk as follows(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:6)w= w(cid:11)vThen ∀θ ∈ SL+ ∪ SL−(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: g((cid:11)v) = (cid:11)v(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:18)we have that:μbs,w (θ) = w= w(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: v(θ) = 1(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v(θ) = 1The result follows similarly for ¯μbs,w (θ).(cid:18) ∈ Vk: v(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: g((cid:11)v) = (cid:11)v(cid:18)and v(cid:18)(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:11)= w= μk,w(cid:18) (θ)Furthermore, from Theorem 21 we have that if g((cid:11)v) = (cid:11)v(cid:18)then (cid:11)v(cid:18) (cid:4) (cid:11)v. Hence,(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:18) ∈ Vk: vμk,w(cid:18) (θ) = w(cid:2) w= w= μbs,w (θ)The proof that ¯μk,w(cid:18) (θ) (cid:3) ¯μbs,w (θ) follows similarly. (cid:2)(cid:11)v(θ) = 1(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: v(θ) = 1(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: g((cid:11)v) = (cid:11)v(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:18), v(θ) = 1For BSBP the following result identifies nestedness constraints on the set of valuation pairs with non-zero probability,and SL−resulting in a belief pair which is truth-functional on SL+.Theorem 31. Let (cid:11)μbs,w be a BSBP where w is non-zero on the set of bounded supervaluation pairs {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr} such that for (cid:11)v i and(cid:11)v j where i (cid:13)= j either F i ⊆ F j or F j ⊆ F i and either F i ⊆ F j or F j ⊆ F i . In this case: ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL+,(cid:10)μbs,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = minμbs,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)μbs,w (θ), μbs,w (ϕ)(cid:10)(cid:11)μbs,w (θ), μbs,w (ϕ)andand¯μbs,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = min¯μbs,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:10)and ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL−(cid:11)¯μbs,w (θ), ¯μbs,w (ϕ)(cid:10)(cid:11)¯μbs,w (θ), ¯μbs,w (ϕ)Proof. Here we only prove the result for sentences in SL+. Given theconditions of the theorem we can assume w.l.o.g. that the set of bounded supervaluation pairs {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr} are ordered suchthat F 1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ F r . Now by Lemma 16 it holds that ∀θ ∈ SL+, v i(θ) = 1 if and only if v F i (θ) = 1. Also, by Lemma 16 itfollows that if v F i (θ) = 1 then v F j (θ) = 1 for j = i + 1, . . . , r. Hence, ∃t (cid:2) r such that:. The result follows similarly for sentences in SL−(cid:6)(cid:7)= {(cid:11)vt, . . . , (cid:11)vr}(cid:11)v i: v i(θ) = 1Similarly, for ϕ ∈ SL+, ∃t(cid:7)(cid:18) (cid:2) r such that(cid:6)(cid:11)v i: v i(ϕ) = 1= {(cid:11)vt(cid:18) , . . . , (cid:11)vr}Hence, since from a basic property of supervaluation pairs v i(θ ∧ ϕ) = min(v i(θ), v i(ϕ)) it follows thatJ.

Let (cid:11)μbs,w be a BSBP for which {(cid:11)v ∈ Vbs: w((cid:11)v) > 0} = {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr} can be ordered such that (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 (cid:4) · · · (cid:4) (cid:11)vr thenthe following holds:∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL, μbs,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = min(cid:10)(cid:11)μbs,w (θ), μbs,w (ϕ)(cid:10)¯μbs,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)¯μbs,w (θ), ¯μbs,w (ϕ)andand∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL+and ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL−(cid:10)¯μbs,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = min, μbs,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)¯μbs,w (θ), ¯μbs,w (ϕ)(cid:10)(cid:11)μbs,w (θ), μbs,w (ϕ)andProof. Since (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) · · · (cid:4) (cid:11)vr it follows from Theorem 15 that P1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Pr . Hence μbs,w and ¯μbs,w are necessity and possi-bility measures on SL respectively. Also, it trivially holds that F i ⊆ F i+1 and F i ⊇ F i+1 for i = 1, . . . , r − 1. The result thenfollows immediately from Theorem 31. (cid:2)Corollary 32 identifies a special case of the conditions of Theorem 31 for BSBPs generated from a probability distributionwhich is non-zero only on a set of valuation pairs that can be totally ordered by the semantic precision relation. Recall fromSection 4.2 that in this case a SBP corresponds to a necessity and possibility measure on SL. Combined with Theorem 31this results in uncertainty measures that are partially functional in general, and fully truth-functional on SL+and SL−.Corollary 32 has close parallels with a related result for KBP originally given in [23] as follows:Theorem 33. Let (cid:11)μk,w be a KBP for which {(cid:11)v ∈ Vk: w((cid:11)v) > 0} = {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr} can be ordered such that (cid:11)v 1 (cid:4) (cid:11)v 2 (cid:4) · · · (cid:4) (cid:11)vr . In thiscase: ∀θ, ϕ ∈ SL(cid:10)(cid:11)μk,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = minμk,w (θ), μk,w (ϕ)(cid:10)μk,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)μk,w (θ), μk,w (ϕ)(cid:10)¯μk,w (θ ∧ ϕ) = min¯μk,w (θ ∨ ϕ) = max(cid:11)¯μk,w (θ), ¯μk,w (ϕ)(cid:10)(cid:11)¯μk,w (θ), ¯μk,w (ϕ)andandTheorem 33 is an even stronger result that Corollary 32 in that for KBPs, if an agent’s uncertainty concerns only thesemantic precision of the correct interpretation of L, then the resulting belief pair is fully truth-functional. Indeed, insuch a case KBPs satisfy the definition of lower and upper truth-values (membership values) in interval fuzzy logic (settheory) as proposed independently by Zadeh [43], Grattan-Guiness [13], Jahn [15] and Sambuc [33]. Furthermore, given theisomorphic relationship between interval fuzzy logic and Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy logic [1], Theorem 33 also allowsfor an interpretation of the latter in terms of KBPs. More specifically, we can interpret intuitionistic fuzzy truth and falsitydegrees in a sentence θ as corresponding to the probability that θ is absolutely true and the probability that θ is absolutelyfalse respectively, based on an underlying truth-model of Kleene valuation pairs about which the only uncertainty relatesto semantic precision. In this case we can think of these measures as analogous to necessity and possibility measures, butwhere the truth-model is that of Kleene rather than supervaluation pairs.38J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–415. Decision making about assertionsA fundamental challenge in natural language communications is to understand why we often choose to make vagueassertions when we have many potentially suitable crisp (semantically precise) alternatives at our disposal. If the aimwere simply to convey information then we might suppose that the use of vague statements would only result in reducedefficiency. Indeed some formal results in the game theoretic literature seem to support this view [25]. However, van Deemter[39,40] identifies a number of plausible reasons for the utility of vagueness in natural language. In [39] a decision theoreticapproach is proposed according to which different utterances have different rewards or costs (negative rewards), and wherethe choice of assertion in a particular context is driven by utility. Such an approach has similarities with the assertability riskmodels of Giles [11] and Kyburg [17]. In this section we outline a very preliminary application of belief pairs to assertiondecisions, focusing on a class of communication scenarios referred to by van Deemter [39] as future contingencies. Herewe consider a communications model in which different agents have different, and to some degree conflicting, goals andobjectives. An agent is then required to make a statement, perhaps in the form of a prediction or commitment, about somefuture state of the world. While there are potential rewards for making such statements, there may also be the risk ofsignificant costs if they prove to be incorrect or if promises are seen to be broken. In such scenarios, van Deemter argues,the utility of making a vague assertion may be potentially higher than that for making a crisp assertion, primarily becausethe risk of incurring costs is significantly reduced. Future contingency scenarios are important in many AI applicationsinvolving natural language generation (see [31] for an overview) such as automatic weather forecast generation [12] or inautomatic medical diagnosis systems [29].To illustrate the type of problems involved consider the example of a politician who is considering making a pledge at anupcoming British General Election. She would like to promise as high a reduction in the budget deficit as possible (achievedby cutting public expenditure) resulting in as small an increase as possible in unemployment. She judges that a promiseof this kind would be popular with voters and would increase the probability of her (or her political party) winning theelection. One possibility would be to decide on a crisp assertion and promise say ‘at least a 40% reduction in the deficitand no more than a 2% increase in unemployment’. However, she may then be worried that she will find it difficult tomeet this commitment exactly and subsequently be punished by the voters at the following election in five years time. Ifon the other hand she promises ‘a significant reduction in the debt with only a minor increase in unemployment’ then shemay still be able to curry favour with the voters at the current general election while reducing the risk of being accused ofbreaking promises at the subsequent election. To quote van Deemter [39] ‘a precise promise is easier to break than a vagueone’. The notion of valuation pairs and truth-gaps may provide some insight into why this is indeed the case. The votersin our example may interpret the politician as promising that their assertion will be absolutely true by some future date,perhaps by the subsequent election, and reward them accordingly. However, they will not then significantly punish themunless the assertion turns out to be absolutely false. Hence, in future contingency scenarios the truth-gap associated with avague assertion provides the agent with a window of opportunity in which they can maximise their chance of reward andminimise their risk of loss. Furthermore, in practice almost all assertion decisions of this kind will be made in the presenceof significant epistemic uncertainty. Consequently, by combining a model of truth-gaps with that of epistemic uncertainty,bipolar belief pairs may well provide a useful framework for the analysis of future contingency and similar assertion deci-sion scenarios. Indeed, for the above example there is a clear need for an integrated model of this kind. Since phrases suchas ‘significant reduction’ and ‘minor increase’ are vague we would certainly expect linguistic conventions to be based aroundtruth-models which explicitly represent borderline cases. For example, the truth valuation of the statement that there willbe only ‘a minor increase in unemployment’ might be determined by lower and upper thresholds on the overall percentageincrease in unemployment, along the lines described in Section 4.1 for the concept short. In addition, the inherent semanticuncertainty associated with the interpretation of such natural language descriptions would mean that the politician will beuncertain as to the exact nature of the language convention which should be applied in this case. This semantic uncertaintycould then manifest itself as uncertainty regarding the values of the relevant lower and upper thresholds for phrases suchas ‘minor increase in unemployment’. Furthermore, since the politician is making a prediction about the future, she will beuncertain as to what will be the actual state of the world. For example, she will be unsure about what will be the actualpercentage changes to unemployment and to the deficit. The bipolar model outlined in Section 4 would then allow thepolitician to capture all these different aspects influencing the likely truth or falsity of their predictions by lower and upperbelief measures on the sentences concerned.We now propose a simple utility decision model based on bipolar belief measures in order to explore the potentialadvantages of asserting a vague sentence over a crisp one. Suppose that, at time t0, an agent must choose between assertionsθ and ϕ concerning the state of the world at some future time t1, where ϕ is crisp and θ is vague. Assume that the rewardfor making either assertion at time t0 is x > 0. At time t1 there will be a further reward y > 0 if the assertion made att0 is judged to be absolutely true given the actual state of the world at t1. Similarly, there will be a cost −z (z > 0) ifthe assertion made is judged to be absolutely false given the state of the world at t1. Furthermore, in the case of vagueassertion θ , there will be a small cost −w (0 (cid:2) w (cid:2) z) if θ is judged to be a borderline statement at t1.J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4139Now suppose that at time t0 the agents’ beliefs about the state of the world at t1 is represented by a bipolar belief pair(cid:11)μ.11 Let U θ and U ϕ denote the total rewards (which may be negative) for making assertions θ and ϕ respectively. Thenbased on (cid:11)μ, the agent can evaluate their expected reward for making either assertion θ or ϕ at time t0 as follows:E(U θ ) = x + μ(θ) y − μ(¬θ)z −E(U ϕ) = x + μ(ϕ) y − μ(¬ϕ)z = x − z + μ(ϕ)( y + z)(cid:10)(cid:11)¯μ(θ) − μ(θ)w = x − z + μ(θ)( y + w) + ¯μ(θ)(z − w)where, since ϕ is a crisp statement, μ(ϕ) = ¯μ(ϕ) = μ(ϕ). Given this formulation we can now investigate under whatcircumstances the agent would expect a higher reward for asserting the vague statement θ than for asserting the precisestatement ϕ. Initially, we make the simplifying assumption that θ being a borderline case is effectively cost neutral so thatw = 0. Furthermore, we assume that θ is selected such that μ(θ) < μ(ϕ) < ¯μ(θ).12 Now let α = yz be the ratio of thereward for the assertion being absolutely true at t1 against the cost of the assertion be absolutely false at t1. Then we havethat:E(U θ ) (cid:3) E(U ϕ)if and only if α (cid:2)¯μ(θ) − μ(ϕ)μ(ϕ) − μ(θ)Hence, we have an upper bound on the ratio of reward y over cost z for which E(U θ ) (cid:3) E(U ϕ ), so that the higher the costof making an assertion which is absolutely false at t1 relative to the reward of making an assertion which is absolutelytrue at t1, the more likely it is that the agent will be better off choosing a vague over a crisp assertion. In addition, asthe belief value of ϕ approaches to the lower belief value for θ then there is an increasing range of ratio values for whichthe agent will be better off choosing the vague over the crisp assertion. Furthermore, notice that if μ(ϕ) (cid:2) μ(θ)+ ¯μ(θ)thenE(U θ ) (cid:3) E(U ϕ ) for all α ∈ [0, 1] (i.e. for all cases where y (cid:2) z). A particular instance of this is when (cid:11)μ(θ) = (0, 1) andμ(ϕ) (cid:2) 0.5 and hence, if the cost of making an assertion which is absolutely false at t1 is higher than the reward formaking an assertion which is absolutely true at t1, then a rational agent should choose a statement which they are certainis borderline over a crisp statement for which their belief value is at most 0.5.2These result must, of course, be understood in the light of the modelling assumption we have made. In particular, wehave assumed that there are the same rewards and costs, x, y and z, for both crisp and vague assertions. We might perhapsjustify this assumption by supposing that the two assertions are sufficiently semantically similar that there would be nodistinction made between them in the allocation of rewards and costs. However, it is equally possible that other agents mayprefer crisp assertions over vague ones. For example, voters may be more likely to vote for a politician who makes crisppromises because such assertions are easier to evaluate at a future date than similar but vague commitments. One way ofmodelling this would be to suppose different rewards x1 and x2 for asserting θ and ϕ at t0 respectively, and where x2 (cid:3) x1.In this case the expected utilities from asserting θ and ϕ are given by:E(U θ ) = x1 − z + μ(θ)( y + w) + ¯μ(θ)(z − w) and E(U ϕ) = x2 − z + μ(ϕ)( y + z)From this we obtain that E(U θ ) (cid:3) E(U ϕ) if and only if α (cid:2) ¯μ(θ)−μ(ϕ)−βμ(ϕ)−μ(θ)of the difference between the two rewards at t0 over the cost at t1 of making an absolutely false assertion. Consequently,the larger the cost of making an absolutely false assertion relative to the different rewards x1, x2 and y, the more likely itis that the agent will be better off making a vague rather than a crisp assertion.and β (cid:2) ¯μ(θ) − μ(ϕ) where β = x2−x1is the ratiozThe above is of course a highly simplified analysis with many assumptions which are probably unrealistic. Despite theselimitations we nonetheless suggest that it does take some small steps towards demonstrating the potential applicability ofthe bipolar belief framework for modelling decision problems involving the choice of vague over crisp assertions. A decisiontheoretic analysis of this kind could have significant applications in Artificial Intelligence. Indeed, some natural languagegeneration systems already include the use of vague words. For example, the weather forecasting system FOG developedby Goldberg et al. [12] includes terms such as westerly or southerly to describe wind direction. A more developed analysisalong the lines of that outline above, raises the possibility of providing such systems with the capability of choosing betweenvague and crisp assertions on the basis of a range of factors including context and uncertainty levels.6. ConclusionsIn this paper we have introduced valuation pairs as a truth-model which captures borderline cases relating to vaguepropositional statements. Different classes of valuation pairs have been discussed and the relationships between them havebeen investigated. In particular, we have provided axiomatic characterisations of supervaluation pairs and Kleene valuation11 For this analysis it is not important whether (cid:11)μ is an SBP or a KBP.12 A justification of this assumption is as follows: Suppose that θ is selected by the agent so that it is a less semantically precise statement than ϕ. Thenin the framework of valuation pairs this would mean the following: If (cid:11)μ is generated by probability distribution w where {(cid:11)v: w((cid:11)v) > 0} = {(cid:11)v 1, . . . , (cid:11)vr }then since ϕ is crisp v i (ϕ) = ¯v i (ϕ) = v i (ϕ) for i = 1, . . . , r and since θ is less semantically precise than ϕ then v i (θ) (cid:2) v i (ϕ) (cid:2) ¯v i (θ) for i = 1, . . . , r,where in some cases these inequalities are strict. From this it follows immediately that μ(θ) < μ(θ) < ¯μ(θ).40J. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–41pairs. Furthermore, we have exposed the close relationship between Kleene valuation pairs and bounded supervaluationpairs.We have then proposed an integrated approach to truth-gaps and epistemic uncertainty in the form of lower and upperbelief measures on the sentences of the language. In this context the lower measure of a sentence θ is the probabilitythat θ is absolutely true, while the upper measure is the probability that θ is not absolutely false. The definition of thesetwo measures in terms of an underlying probability distribution on valuation pairs can be justified by assuming that thetruth-model for the language is functionally dependent on both the state of the world and conventions for language use,and where epistemic uncertainty is modelled by a probability distribution on world state and language convention pairs.Further justification is provided by a betting argument according to which a rational agent must define their lower andupper measures so as avoid accepting Dutch books consisting of sets of lower and upper bets. Within this bipolar beliefframework we have outlined a possible decision theoretic argument as to why, in some circumstances, it might be optimalfor an agent to choose to assert a vague statement over a crisp one when making forecasts or promises relating to somefuture state of the world about which they are uncertain.The model of truth-gaps provided by valuation pairs assumes that the notions of absolutely true and absolutely falseare primitives and consequently our framework lacks some the expressiveness of other approaches especially with regardto higher order vagueness. For example, many formalisations of supervaluationism are based on modal logic (e.g. Bennett[2]) and which therefore allow the explicit representation of higher order statements such as ‘absolutely true θ ’ and ‘bor-derline true that absolutely true θ ’ etc. Indeed, the importance of capturing higher-order borderline cases in this manner islargely taken for granted by theorists of vagueness. However, we argue that there are a number of justifications for a morestraightforward approach which avoids representing higher-order statements as part of the language.From a practical perspective the valuation pair framework is sufficiently general to encompass a range of different theo-retical approaches to truth-gaps. This enables direct comparisons between, for instance, supervaluationism and three-valuedlogic of the kind we have outlined in this paper. Furthermore, the valuation pair approach can be naturally extended so asto provide an integrated model of truth-gaps and epistemic uncertainty based on lower and upper measures as described inSection 4. From a more theoretical perspective we argue that the idea of higher-order truth-gaps is actually quite problem-atic and that it is far from clear that valuations of the form borderline true that absolutely true are even meaningful. Consider,for example, the concept of short as defined on the scale of heights. Suppose that instead of the two threshold values (cid:7) and(cid:7) suggested in Section 4.1, we have a series of increasing thresholds representing borderline cases, borderline borderlinecases and so on. The problem with this interpretation of the concept is that, as pointed out by Sainsbury [32], it naturallycollapses to the original two-borderline case. This is because, given the original intuition behind borderline cases as beingthose which are neither absolutely true nor absolutely false, we must be able to partition the set of heights as follows:There is a set of lower heights to which the concept short is absolutely and totally applicable. Similarly, there is an upperset of heights to which short is absolutely and totally not applicable. The union of all other sets of heights, no matter whatlevel of borderline they constitute, can simply be viewed as a type of borderline i.e. heights which for which short is neitherabsolutely applicable nor absolutely not applicable. Another perspective on this is given by Raffman [30] who suggests thatsecond order statement such as ‘absolutely true θ ’ and ‘absolutely false θ ’ simply do not admit truth-gaps. In other words,such statements admit only a binary truth-model. Indeed, Raffman argues, that given our intuitive understanding of ‘abso-lutely true θ ’ and ‘absolutely false θ ’ as meaning that θ is unquestionably true or unquestionably false respectively, thena statement such as ‘borderline absolutely true θ ’ can have no other truth-value but false. Of course, none of this meansthat an agent may not be uncertain as to the exact boundaries of a concept. However, we would argue that this is a formof semantic uncertainty about the conventions of language use and consequently should be modelled probabilistically asdescribed in Section 4, rather than being incorporated into the underlying truth-model by means of modal operators.It is certainly the case that a purely propositional framework, as described in this paper, has definite limitations. Futurework should therefore explore extending these ideas to predicate logic. One initial approach might be to develop random setand prototype theory models of the kind introduced in [20], so as to incorporate both lower and upper threshold distancesfrom prototypes. The idea here is that the interpretation of a predicate R would be defined by a set of prototypes P R insome underlying metric space, together with lower and upper thresholds, (cid:7) and (cid:7), on the distance of elements from P R.For an element of the space x with distance less than (cid:7) from P R, R(x) would be absolutely true, while for an element xwith distance from P R greater than (cid:7), R(x) would be absolutely false. All other elements would then be borderline casesof R. Semantic uncertainty about the exact values of (cid:7) and (cid:7) could then be modelled by a joint probability distribution onthe two thresholds. An elementary model of this kind has already been proposed in [21] and in [38], but there is scope todevelop a much more general version of this prototype theory based framework to capture borderline cases and semanticuncertainty in predicate definitions.As we have already indicated in Section 5 the bipolar framework outlined in this paper has potential application to nat-ural language generation systems. Other areas of Artificial Intelligence where our approach may have applications includeconsensus modelling and multi-agent dialogues. For the former, truth-gaps may provide a means by which an agent canadapt their beliefs so as to reach consensus with other agents whilst maintaining a certain level of internal consistency.Indeed truth-gaps are fundamental here, in allowing for a weaker notion of consistency according to which different valua-tions may still be considered consistent. Furthermore, consensus modelling provides an example of an application in whichthe interests of different agents are more or less aligned. More specifically, agents share a common goal of, where possible,reaching a consensus about their beliefs. In multi-agent dialogues, lower and upper valuations can provide a model of strongJ. Lawry, Y. Tang / Artificial Intelligence 191–192 (2012) 20–4141and weak assertions, with semantic precision providing a structured criterion according to which different viewpoints canbe clustered together. Preliminary studies have been carried out in both application areas for Kleene valuation pairs (see[24] and [22]). There are plans to extend these to more in depth studies, including developing the proposed methods withinthe general valuation pairs framework.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.
