IntroductionFirst order logic increases the expressive power of propositional logic a lot through adding quantifiers. Classicalfirst order logic only possesses two quantifiers, the universal quantifier (∀) and the existential quantifier (∃). However,these quantifiers are often too limited to express some properties of certain mathematical structures and to modelcertain knowledge stated in natural languages. This leads logicians and linguists to introduce the notion of generalizedquantifiers.As early as in 1957, Mostowski [29] proposed a general notion of generalized quantifier and showed that first orderlogic with a class of generalized quantifiers are not axiomatizable. This work together with others initiated the subjectof model theoretic logics.Barwise and Cooper [2] started the studies of generalized quantifiers in natural languages. Since then, a rich varietyof generalized quantifiers in natural languages have been found, and their expressive power and logical propertieshave been thoroughly investigated from both semantic and syntactic aspects.

Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606a generalized quantifier as a relation on the subsets of a universe of discourse, and systematically examined variousrelational behaviors of generalized quantifiers such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, linearity and monotonicityand their roles in realizing certain inference patterns. For a recent review on the theory of generalized quantifiers innatural languages, we refer to [24].It has been clearly realized in the artificial intelligence community that natural languages are suited to high levelknowledge representation [26,33]. This is indeed one of the main motivations of computing with words [25,50,57].However, classical logic is not adequate to face the essential uncertainty, vagueness and ambiguity of human reasoningexpressed in natural languages. Consequently, the logical treatments and mathematical models of the concepts ofuncertainty, vagueness and ambiguity is of increasing importance in artificial intelligence and related researches, andmany logicians have proposed different logic systems as a formalization of reasoning under uncertainty, vaguenessand ambiguity (see, for example, [3,44–47,49], [11, Chapter III.1], or [19, Chapter 7]).Since quantifiers have the ability of summarizing the properties of a class of objects without enumerating them,linguistic quantification is a very important topic in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning. Quantifiersin natural languages are usually vague in some sense. Some representative examples of linguistic quantifiers withvagueness are [56]: several, most, much, not many, very many, not very many, few, quite a few, large number, smallnumber, close to five, approximately ten, frequently. It is clear that two-valued logic is not suited to cope with vaguequantifiers. There has been, therefore, increasing interest about logical treatment of quantifiers in human languages infuzzy logic community. Indeed, sometimes fuzzy logic permits a more precise representation of the kind of quantifiersin various natural languages.The first fuzzy set theoretic approach to linguistic quantifiers was described by Zadeh [55,56]. In his approach,linguistic quantifiers are treated as fuzzy numbers and they may be manipulated through the use of arithmetic forfuzzy numbers. The truth evaluation of a linguistically quantified statement is performed by computing the cardinalityof the fuzzy set defined by the linguistic predicate in such a statement and then by finding the degree to which thiscardinality is compatible with the involved quantifier. Since then, a considerable amount of literature [1,4–7,9,10,12,15–18,30–32,42,43,51,52] has been devoted to the studies of linguistic quantifiers in the framework of fuzzy settheory. For example, in a series of papers [39–41], Yager proposed the substitution method for evaluating quantifiedpropositions and the method based on OWA operators. For a survey, see [27,28].On the other hand, fuzzy quantification models are employed in solving a great variety of problems from manydifferent fields such as database querying [7,23], data mining and knowledge discovering [7,25], information fusion[21,25], group decision making and multiple-objective decision making [20,40], inductive learning [21], and opti-mization and control [22].This paper introduces a new framework for modeling quantifiers in natural languages. In this framework, linguisticquantifiers are represented by Sugeno’s fuzzy measures [35]. More precisely, a quantifier Q is seen as a family of fuzzymeasures indexed by nonempty sets. For each nonempty set X, the quantifier Q limited to the discourse universe Xis defined to be a fuzzy measure QX on X, and for any subset E of X, the quantity QX(E) expresses the truth valueof the quantified statement “Q Xs are As” when A is a crisp predicate and the set of elements in X satisfying A is E.As is well known, predicates in linguistically quantified statements are often vague too. In this general case, the truthvalue of a quantified proposition is then evaluated by using Sugeno’s integral [35].The advantage of this framework is that it allows us to have some elegant logical properties of linguistic quanti-fiers. For example, we are able to establish a prenex normal form theorem for linguistic quantifiers (see Corollary 34).It should be pointed out that this paper only deals with increasing quantifiers because fuzzy measures assumemonotonicity. Thus, quantifiers such as several, few, quite a few, small number, not many, not very many, close tofive, approximately ten cannot be modeled in our proposed setting.This paper is arranged as follows. For convenience of the reader, in Section 2 we review some notions and resultsfrom the theory of Sugeno’s fuzzy measures and integrals. In Section 3, (linguistic) quantifiers are formally definedin terms of fuzzy measure, and several operations of quantifiers are introduced. In Section 4, we construct a firstorder language with linguistic quantifiers and present semantics of such a logical language. In particular, the truthvaluation of quantified formulas is given by using Sugeno’s integrals. Section 5 is devoted to examine thoroughlylogical properties of linguistic quantifiers. In particular, we prove a prenex normal form theorem for logical formulaswith linguistic quantifiers. In Section 6, the notions of cardinal and numeric quantifiers are introduced so that we areable to establish a close link between the Sugeno integral semantics and the Zadeh’s cardinality-based semantics oflinguistic quantifiers. In Section 7, we present some simple applications to illustrate the utility of the results obtainedM. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606583in the current paper. In Section 8, our Sugeno integral approach to evaluation of quantified statements is comparedwith others. A set of criteria for linguistic quantification was proposed in the previous literature. The relationshipbetween these criteria and the results obtained in the present paper is clarified. We draw conclusions and point outsome problems for further studies in Section 9.2. Fuzzy measures and Sugeno integralsThis is a preliminary section. In this section, we are going to review some notions and fundamental results neededin the sequel from the theory of fuzzy measures and Sugeno’s integrals. For details, we refer to [35] or [11, Chapter 5].The theory of fuzzy measures and integrals was originally proposed by Sugeno [35]. Fuzzy measure is a general-ization of the notion of measure in mathematical analysis, and it relaxes the condition of additivity for usual measureand only assume monotonicity. Thus, fuzzy measures are very general, and probability measures, Zadeh’s possibilitymeasures, Shafer’s belief functions among others [37] are shown to be special cases of fuzzy measures. Sugeno’sintegral is analogous to Lebesgue integral. The difference between them is that addition and multiplication in thedefinition of Lebesgue integral are replaced respectively by the operations “min” and “max” when Sugeno’s integralis considered. Since its inception, the theory of Sugeno’s measures and integrals has been applied in the fields ofsubjective evaluation, decision systems and pattern recognition, name a few.A fuzzy measure on a set X is a function defined on some subsets of X. In general, the domain of a fuzzy measurecan be taken to be a monotone family which is a set of subsets of X containing ∅ and X itself and closed under limitsof monotone sequences of subsets of X. But in this paper we focus our attention on a special class of monotone familycalled Borel field.Definition 1. [35, page 10] Let X be a nonempty set. A Borel field over X is a subset ℘ of 2X satisfying the nextconditions:(1) ∅ ∈ ℘;(2) If E ∈ ℘, then X − E ∈ ℘; and(3) If En ∈ ℘ for 1 (cid:1) n < ∞, then(cid:1)∞n=1 En ∈ ℘.A typical example of Borel field over a nonempty set X is the power set 2X of X. Indeed, in this paper, we willmainly consider this special Borel field.Definition 2. [35, Definition 2.3] If X is a nonempty set and ℘ is a Borel field over X, then (X, ℘) is called ameasurable space.In order to define fuzzy measure, we need the notion of limit of set sequence. If E1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ En ⊆ En+1 ⊆ · · ·, thenthe sequence {En} is said to be increasing and we definelimn→∞En =∞(cid:2)n=1En,and if E1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ En ⊇ En+1 ⊇ · · ·, then the sequence {En} is said to be decreasing and we definelimn→∞En =∞(cid:3)n=1En.Both increasing and decreasing sequences of sets are said to be monotone.Definition 3. [35, Definitions 2.2 and 2.4] Let (X, ℘) be a measurable space. If a set function m : ℘ → [0, 1] satisfiesthe following properties:(1) m(∅) = 0 and m(X) = 1;(2) (Monotonicity) If E, F ∈ ℘ and E ⊆ F , then m(E) (cid:1) m(F ); and584M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606(3) (Continuity) If En ∈ ℘ for 1 (cid:1) n < ∞ and {En} is monotone, then(cid:4)m(cid:5)limn→∞En= limn→∞m(En),then m is called a fuzzy measure over (X, ℘), and (X, ℘, m) is called a fuzzy measure space.Intuitively, m(E) expresses someone’s subjective evaluation of the statement “x is in E” in a situation in which heguesses whether x is in E.The continuity of fuzzy measure is often discarded. Obviously, a probability measure is a fuzzy measure. Thenotion of plausibility measure introduced in [13,14] or [19] (Section 2.8) is similar to that of fuzzy measure. Theonly difference between them is that the range of a plausibility measure can be any partially ordered set with top andbottom elements rather than the unit interval.Let us first consider an example of fuzzy measure which will be used to define the existential quantifier.Example 4. Let X be a nonempty set. If π : X → [0, 1] is a mapping with supx∈X π(x) = 1, then it is called apossibility distribution, and for each E ⊆ X, we defineΠπ (E) = supx∈Eπ(x).Then Ππ (·) is a fuzzy measure over (X, 2X) and it is called the possibility measure induced by π . It should be notedthat a possibility measure is not continuous from top, that is, there is a decreasing sequence {En} with(cid:4)(cid:5)Ππlimn→∞En< limn→∞Ππ (En).(1) Suppose that x0 ∈ X and(cid:6)if x = x0,otherwise.πx0 (x) =1,0,Then πx0 is a possibility distribution and Ππx0(cid:6)Ππx0(E) =1,0,if x0 ∈ E,otherwise.is the membership function of x0, that is, for any E ⊆ X,(2) If we define π(x) = 1 for all x ∈ X, then it is easy to see that for any E ⊆ X,(cid:6)Ππ =if E (cid:9)= ∅,1,0, otherwise.The notion of dual fuzzy measure is required when dealing with dual linguistic quantifier. We introduce such anotion in the next definition.Definition 5. Let (X, ℘, m) be a fuzzy measure space. Then the dual set function m∗ : ℘ → [0, 1] of m is defined by(E) = 1 − m(X − E)∗mfor each E ∈ ℘.It is easy to see that m∗ is a fuzzy measure over (X, ℘) too.The following example gives the dual of possibility measure, necessity measure. It will be used in defining theuniversal quantifier.Example 6. Let π be a possibility distribution over X and Ππ the possibility measure induced by π . Then the dualmeasure Nπ = Π ∗Nπ (E) = infx /∈Eπ of Ππ is given by(cid:5)(cid:4)1 − π(x)for each E ⊆ X, and it is called the necessity measure induced by π .M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606585(1) It is interesting to note that Nπx0(2) If π(x) = 1 for every x ∈ X, then= Π ∗πx0= Ππx0.(cid:6)Nπ (E) =if E = X,1,0, otherwise.We now turn to consider the Sugeno’s integral of a function. It is not the case that every function is integrable.Those integrable functions are isolated by the following definition.Definition 7. [35, Definition 3.3] Let (X, ℘) be a measurable space, and let h : X → [0, 1] be a mapping from X intothe unit interval. For any λ ∈ [0, 1], we write(cid:7)x ∈ X: h(x) (cid:2) λ(cid:8).Hλ =If Hλ ∈ ℘ for all λ ∈ [0, 1], then h is said to be ℘-measurable.The following lemma demonstrates measurability of some composed functions. Indeed, we will see later that thismeasurability guarantees that truth values of quantifications of negation, conjunction and disjunction are well-definedin our Sugeno integral semantics.Lemma 8. [35, Propositions 3.1 and 3.2] If h, h1 and h2 : X → [0, 1] are all ℘-measurable functions, then so are1 − h, min(h1, h2) and max(h1, h2), where(1 − h)(x) = 1 − h(x),(cid:5)(cid:4)min(h1, h2)(x) = minh1(x), h2(x)and(cid:4)max(h1, h2)(x) = max(cid:5)h1(x), h2(x)for every x ∈ X.Now we are able to present the key notion in this section.Definition 9. [35, Definition 3.1 and page 19] Let (X, ℘, m) be a fuzzy measure space. If A ∈ ℘ and h : X → [0, 1] isa ℘-measurable function, then the Sugeno’s integral of h over A is defined byh ◦ m = supλ∈[0,1]A(cid:11)(cid:10)λ, m(A ∩ Hλ),minwhere Hλ = {x ∈ X: h(x) (cid:2) λ} for each λ ∈ [0, 1]. In particular,A = X.(cid:12)A h ◦ m will be abbreviated to(cid:12)h ◦ m wheneverThe next lemma gives an alternative definition of Sugeno’s integral for the case that the Borel field in a measurablespace is taken to be the power set of the underlying set.Lemma 10. [35, Theorem 3.1] If the Borel field ℘ in the fuzzy measure space (X, ℘, m) is the power set 2X of X,then for any function h : X → [0, 1], we have:(cid:9)(cid:9)h ◦ m = supF ∈2XA(cid:10)mininfx∈F(cid:11)h(x), m(A ∩ F ).A simplified calculation method of Sugeno’s integrals over finite sets is presented in the following lemma.586M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606Lemma 11. [35, Theorem 4.1] Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a finite set, and let h :→ [0, 1] be such that h(xi) (cid:1) h(xi+1)for 1 (cid:1) i (cid:1) n − 1 (if not so, rearrange h(xi), 1 (cid:1) i (cid:1) n). Then(cid:9)h ◦ m = nmaxi=1A(cid:11)(cid:10)h(xi), m(A ∩ Xi)min,where Xi = {xj : i (cid:1) i (cid:1) n} for 1 (cid:1) i (cid:1) n.We now collect some properties of Sugeno’s integrals needed in what follows.Lemma 12. [35, Propositions 3.4 and 3.5, Theorems 3.2 and 3.5] Suppose that (X, ℘, m) is a fuzzy measure space.(1) Let a ∈ [0, 1]. Then it holds that(cid:9)a ◦ m = a,where “a” in the left-hand side is seen as a constant function a : X → [0, 1] such that a(x) = a for every x ∈ X.(2) Let h, h(cid:13) : X → [0, 1] be two ℘-measurable functions. If h (cid:1) h(cid:13), then there holds(cid:9)(cid:9)h ◦ m (cid:1)(cid:13) ◦ m.hMoreover, for any ℘-measurable functions h1, h2 : → [0, 1], we have:(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:9)max(h1, h2) ◦ m (cid:2) max(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:9)h1 ◦ m,(cid:9)h2 ◦ m(cid:14),min(h1, h2) ◦ m (cid:1) minh1 ◦ m,h2 ◦ m.In particular, the first inequality becomes equality when m is a possibility measure.(3) Let a ∈ [0, 1] and let h : X → [0, 1] be a ℘-measurable function. Then there hold(cid:9)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:14)max(a, h) ◦ m = max(cid:13)a,(cid:9)(cid:9),h ◦ m(cid:14)min(a, h) ◦ m = mina,h ◦ m,where “a” in the left-hand side is as in (1).It may be observed that fuzzy measures are defined over crisp sets before. To conclude this section, we introducethe notion of extension of fuzzy measure over fuzzy sets. Zadeh [54] introduced a natural extension of probabilitymeasure on fuzzy sets. In a similar manner, an extension of fuzzy measure on fuzzy sets can be defined.Definition 13. [35, Definition 3.7] Let (X, ℘, m) be a fuzzy measure space and let (cid:15)℘ be the set of fuzzy subsets of Xwith ℘-measurable membership functions. Then the extension (cid:15)m of m on (cid:15)℘ is defined by(cid:9)(cid:15)m(h) =h ◦ mfor all h ∈ (cid:15)℘.3. Fuzzy quantifiersMany versions of fuzzy set theoretic definition of linguistic quantifier have been introduced in the previous liter-ature. In this paper, we take a different starting point, and a linguistic quantifier will be represented by a family offuzzy measures. We first give a formal definition of fuzzy quantifier in this new framework. To do this, a new notationis needed. For any measurable space (X, ℘), we write M(X, ℘) for the set of all fuzzy measures on (X, ℘).M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606587Definition 14. A fuzzy quantifier (or quantifier for short) consists of the following two items:(i) for each nonempty set X, a Borel field ℘X over X is equipped; and(ii) a choice functionQ : (X, ℘X) (cid:14)→ Q(X,℘X) ∈ M(X, ℘X)of the (proper) class {M(X, ℘X) : (X, ℘X) is a measurable space}.Intuitively, for a given discourse universe X, if the set of objects in X satisfying a (crisp) property A is E, then thequantity QX(E) is thought of as the truth value of the quantified proposition “Q Xs are As”.For simplicity, Q(X,℘X) is often abbreviated to QX whenever the Borel field ℘X can be recognized from the context.In some applications, QX is allowed to be undefined or unspecified for some sets X.To illustrate the above definition, let us consider some examples. The simplest quantifiers are the universal andexistential quantifiers.Example 15. The universal quantifier ∀ = “all” and the existential quantifier ∃ = “some” are defined as follows,respectively: for any set X and for any E ⊆ X,(cid:6)∀X(E) =(cid:6)∃X(E) =if E = X,1,0, otherwise;if E (cid:9)= ∅,otherwise.1,0,The universal and existential quantifiers are crisp quantifiers because ∀X(E), ∃X(E) ∈ {0, 1} for all E ⊆ X.This example shows that both the universal and existential quantifiers can be accommodated in our fuzzy measuredefinition of quantifiers. However, when the discourse universe X is infinite, Zadeh’s cardinality approach to quanti-fiers cannot be used to treat the universal quantifier because it is possible that a proper subset E of X has the samecardinality as X.Except the universal and existential quantifiers, some quantifiers frequently occurred in natural languages can alsobe defined well in terms of fuzzy measures. Let us see the following example.Example 16. For any set X and for any E ⊆ X, we define(cid:6)at least threeX(E) =if |E| (cid:2) 3,1,0, otherwise;“at least three” is an example of crisp generalized quantifier too. The following are three typical examples of fuzzyquantifiers. Suppose that X is a nonempty finite set. Then we define,|E|manyX(E) =|X|(cid:13)|E||X|(cid:13)mostX(E) =(cid:14)almost allX(E) =3/2,(cid:14)2|E||X|for any subset E of X, where |E| stands for the cardinality of E. The above definitions of quantifiers “many”, “most”and “almost all” can be generalized to the case of infinite discourse universe X. Let (X, ℘) be a measurable space,and let µ be a finite measure on (X, ℘), that is, a mapping µ : ℘ → [0, ∞) such that(cid:17)En=(cid:16)µ∞(cid:2)n=1∞(cid:18)n=1µ(En),whenever {En}∞n=1 is a countable pairwise disjoint sub-family of ℘. Then we may define588M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606manyX(E) = µ(E)µ(X)(cid:13),mostX(E) =µ(E)µ(X)(cid:13)(cid:14)3/2µ(E)µ(X),(cid:14)2almost allX(E) =for any E ∈ ℘.The above definitions for quantifiers “many”, “most” and “almost all” seem to be largely arbitrary except theordering: almost allX(E) (cid:1) mostX(E) (cid:1) manyX(E) for any E ⊆ X. One may naturally ask the question: how we canavoid this arbitrariness, or more generally, is there any general methodology for defining linguistic quantifiers? Thisis in a sense equivalent to the problem of how to derive the membership function of a fuzzy set, which is arguably thebiggest open problem in fuzzy set theory. In the 1970s quite a few approaches to estimation of membership functionshad been proposed, including psychological analysis, statistics and preference method. For a survey on these earlyworks, see [11, Chapter IV.1]. However, no significant further progress has been made in more than 30 years. Thecurrent situation is that a theoretical foundation for membership function estimation is still missing. In particular, wedo not have a mathematical theorem in fuzzy set theory which guarantees that the membership function of a fuzzy setcan be approximated in some way, like the law of large numbers in probability theory.Two kinds of fuzzy quantifiers are of special interest, and they are defined in the next definition. We will see laterthat they enjoy some very nice logical properties.Definition 17. A quantifier Q is called a possibility quantifier (resp. necessity quantifier) if for any nonempty set X,and for any E1, E2 ∈ ℘X,(cid:5)(cid:4)QX(E1 ∪ E2) = maxQX(E1), QX(E2)(cid:4)(cid:4)resp. QX(E1 ∩ E2) = minQX(E1), QX(E2)(cid:5)(cid:5).It is clear that the universal quantifier (∀) and the existential quantifier (∃) are respectively a necessity quantifierand a possibility quantifier. More generally, if for each set X, QX is a possibility (resp. necessity) measure inducedby some possibility distribution on X, then Q is a possibility (resp. necessity) quantifier.The following definition introduces a partial order between fuzzy quantifiers and three operations of fuzzy quanti-fiers.Definition 18. Let Q, Q1 and Q2 be quantifiers. Then(1) We say that Q1 is stronger than Q2, written Q1 (cid:16) Q2, if for any nonempty set X and for any E ∈ ℘X, we have(2) The dual Q∗ of Q, and the meet Q1 (cid:17) Q2 and union Q1 (cid:18) Q2 of Q1 and Q2 are defined respectively as follows:Q1X(E) (cid:1) Q2X(E).for any nonempty set X and for any E ∈ ℘X,X(E) def= 1 − QX(X − E),∗Q(cid:5)(cid:4)(Q1 (cid:17) Q2)X(E) def= min,Q1X(E), Q2X(E)(cid:5)(cid:4)(Q1 (cid:18) Q2)X(E) def= max.Q1X(E), Q2X(E)It may be observed that the meet and union operations of quantifiers are exactly the set-theoretic intersection andunion operations, respectively, when quantifiers are imagined as fuzzy subsets of the given Borel field ℘X over anuniverse X of discourse. The intersection and union of fuzzy sets were first defined by Zadeh [53] in terms of “min”and “max” operations on membership functions. Afterwards, many different intersection and union operations of fuzzysets have been proposed in the literature (see for example [11, Section II.1.B]). Indeed, all of these operations can beunified in the framework of t-norm and t-conorm, two notions initially introduced in the theory of probabilistic metricspaces [34]. This observation suggests the possibility of replacing the “min” and “max” operations in the definingM. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606589equations of Q1 (cid:17) Q2 and Q1 (cid:18) Q2 by a general t-norm and t-conorm, respectively. When once such more generaloperations of quantifiers are adopted, the logical properties of linguistic quantifier related to the meet and unionoperations of quantifiers obtained in this paper should naturally be reexamined (cf. the remark after Proposition 31).On the other hand, in practical applications an important problem is how to choose suitable t-norms and t-conorms.There have been some experiments verifying the accurateness of various fuzzy set operations reported in the literature.For a short survey on the early works in this direction, see [11, Section IV.1.C].Example 19. (1) The universal and existential quantifiers are the dual of each other: ∀∗ = ∃ and ∃∗ = ∀.(2) For any nonempty finite set X and for any E ⊆ X,∗(almost all)X(E) = 2|E||X|(cid:13)−|E||X|(cid:19)(at least three (cid:17) many)X(E) =(at least three (cid:18) many)X(E) =(cid:14)2,|E||X| ,0,1,2|X| ,1|X| ,0,if |E| (cid:2) 3,otherwise,if |E| (cid:2) 3,if |E| = 2,if |E| = 1,if E = ∅.Several algebraic laws for quantifier operations are presented in the next lemma. They show that quantifiers togetherwith the operations defined above form a De Morgan algebra.Lemma 20. (1) For any quantifier Q, we have ∀ (cid:16) Q (cid:16) ∃. In other words, the universal quantifier (∀) is the strongestquantifier, and the existential quantifier (∃) is the weakest one.(2) For all quantifiers Q1 and Q2, it holds that Q1 (cid:17) Q2 (cid:16) Q1 and Q1 (cid:16) Q1 (cid:18) Q2.(3) For all quantifiers Q1 and Q2, we have:(Commutativity) Q1 (cid:17) Q2 = Q2 (cid:17) Q1, Q1 (cid:18) Q2 = Q2 (cid:18) Q1.(Associativity) Q1 (cid:17) (Q2 (cid:17) Q3) = (Q1 (cid:17) Q2) (cid:17) Q3, Q1 (cid:18) (Q2 (cid:18) Q3) = (Q1 (cid:18) Q2) (cid:18) Q3.(Absorption) Q1 (cid:17) (Q1 (cid:18) Q2) = Q1, Q1 (cid:18) (Q1 (cid:17) Q2) = Q1.2, (Q1 (cid:18) Q2)∗ = Q∗(De Morgan law) (Q1 (cid:17) Q2)∗ = Q∗11(cid:17) Q∗2.(cid:18) Q∗Proof.

The alphabet of our language Lq isgiven as follows:(1) A denumerable set of individual variables: x0, x1, x2, . . .;(2) A set F =It is assumed that(cid:1)∞n=0 Fn of predicate symbols, where Fn is the set of all n-place predicate symbols for each n (cid:2) 0.(cid:1)∞n=1 Fn (cid:9)= ∅;(3) Propositional connectives: ∼, ∧; and(4) Parentheses: (,).The syntax of the language Lq is then presented by the following definition.Definition 21. The set Wff of well-formed formulas is the smallest set of symbol strings satisfying the followingconditions:(i) If n (cid:2) 0, F ∈ Fn, and y1, . . . , yn are individual variables, then F (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ Wff;(ii) If Q is a quantifier, x is an individual variable, and ϕ ∈ Wff, then (Qx)ϕ ∈ Wff; and(iii) If ϕ, ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈ Wff, then ∼ ϕ, ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2 ∈ Wff.590M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606For the sake of simplicity, we introduce some abbreviations:ϕ ∨ ψ def= ∼ (∼ ϕ∧ ∼ ψ),ϕ → ψ def= ∼ ϕ ∨ ψ,ϕ ↔ ψ def=(ϕ → ψ) ∧ (ψ → ϕ).The notions of bound variable and free variable can be introduced in a standard way. We omit their detaileddefinitions here but freely use them in the sequel.The semantics of our language Lq is given by the next two definitions.Definition 22. An interpretation I of our logical language consists of the following items:(i) A measurable space (X, ℘), called the domain of I ;(ii) For each n (cid:2) 0, we associate the individual variable xi with an element xI(iii) For any n (cid:2) 0 and for any F ∈ Fn, there is a ℘n-measurable function F I : Xn → [0, 1].i in X; andFor simplicity, in what follows we assume that the Borel field ℘ in the domain (X, ℘) of an interpretation I isalways taken to be the power set 2X of X, and the Borel field ℘X equipped with a nonempty set X is also 2X for anyquantifier Q. This often shortens the presentation and proof of our results.Definition 23. Let I be an interpretation. Then the truth value TI (ϕ) of a formula ϕ under I is defined recursively asfollows:(i) If ϕ = F (y1, . . . , yn), then(cid:4)1 , . . . , yIyInTI (ϕ) = F I(cid:5).(ii) If ϕ = (Qx)ψ , then(cid:9)TI (ϕ) =TI {./x}(ψ) ◦ QX,where X is the domain of I , TI {./x}(ψ) : X → [0, 1] is a mapping such thatTI {./x}(ϕ)(u) = TI {u/x}(ϕ)for all u ∈ X, and I {u/x} is the interpretation which differs from I only in the assignment of the individual variablex, that is, yI {u/x} = yI for all y (cid:9)= x and xI {u/x} = u;(iii) If ϕ =∼ ψ , thenTI (ϕ) = 1 − TI (ψ),and if ϕ = ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2, then(cid:5)(cid:4)TI (ϕ) = min.TI (ϕ1), TI (ϕ2)The following proposition establishes a close link between the truth evaluation of quantified statement and theextension of fuzzy measure on fuzzy sets.Proposition 24. Let Q be a quantifier and x an individual variable, and let ϕ ∈ Wff. Then for any interpretation I ,(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)TI= (cid:24)QX(cid:4)(cid:5)TI (ϕ),where (cid:24)QX is the extension of QX on fuzzy sets.Proof. Immediate from Definitions 13 and 23(ii). (cid:1)In order to illustrate further the evaluation mechanism of quantified propositions, let us examine some simpleexamples.M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606591Example 25. We first consider the simplest case of quantification. For any quantifier Q and for any ϕ ∈ Wff, if I isan interpretation with the domain being a singleton X = {u}, then for any quantifier Q,(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)TI= TI (ϕ).This means that quantification degenerates on a singleton discourse universe.Example 26. We now consider the strongest and weakest quantifiers. This example shows that the Sugeno integralevaluation of universally and existentially quantified statements coincide with the standard way, and so gives a witnessfor reasonableness of Sugeno integral semantics of linguistic quantification. Let Q be a quantifier and x an individualvariable, and let ϕ ∈ Wff. Then for any interpretation I with domain X, we have(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:4)(∃x)ϕ=TITI {u/x}(ϕ) ◦ ∃X = supF ⊆X(cid:10)mininfu∈F(cid:11)TI {u/x}(ϕ), ∃X(F )= sup∅(cid:9)=F ⊆Xinfu∈FTI {u/x}(ϕ) = supu∈XTI {u/x}(ϕ).Similarly, it holds that(cid:4)= inf(∀x)ϕu∈XTI(cid:5)TI {u/x}(ϕ).To conclude this section, in the case of finite discourse universe we give a necessary and sufficient condition underwhich the truth value of a quantified proposition is bound by a given threshold value from up or below. This conditionis very useful in some real applications (see Example 43 below).Proposition 27. Let X be a finite set, let I be an interpretation with X as its domain, and let λ ∈ [0, 1]. Then for anyquantifier Q and ϕ ∈ Wff, we have:(i) TI ((Qx)ϕ) (cid:2) λ if and only if(cid:8)(cid:5)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ(ii) TI ((Qx)ϕ) (cid:1) λ if and only if(cid:8)(cid:5)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ(cid:2) λ.(cid:1) λ.QXQX(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)Proof. (i) If QX({u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ}) (cid:2) λ, then we obtain(cid:4)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µµ, QXmin(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5)TI(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5)= supµ∈[0,1](cid:4)(cid:2) minλ, QXu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ(cid:2) λ.(cid:4)min(cid:5)TI {u/x}(ϕ), QX(F )(cid:2) λ,Conversely, if(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)TI= supF ⊆Xinfu∈Fthen there exists F0 ⊆ X such that(cid:5)TI {u/x}(ϕ), QX(F0)(cid:4)mininfu∈F0(cid:2) λbecause X is finite. Then it holds that infu∈F0 TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ and QX(F0) (cid:2) λ. Furthermore, we have TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λfor every u ∈ F0 and {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ} ⊇ F0. This yields(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:5)QXu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ(cid:2) QX(F0) (cid:2) λ.(ii) We first prove the “if” part. If µ (cid:1) λ, then it is obvious that(cid:10)µ, QXmin(cid:4)(cid:7)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ(cid:1) λ,(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)and if µ > λ, then {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ} ⊆ {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ},(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)QXu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ(cid:1) QXu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ(cid:1) λ,592M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606and we also have(cid:10)µ, QX(cid:4)(cid:7)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:1) λ.minThus,(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)TI(cid:10)µ, QXmin= supµ∈[0,1](cid:4)(cid:7)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:1) λ.For the “only if” part, suppose that(cid:7)µ0 = infTI {u/x}(ϕ): TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ(cid:8).(cid:4)(cid:7)min(cid:10)µ0, QXSince X is finite, it holds that µ0 > λ and {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ} = {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ0}. Consequently,(cid:10)= minµ0, QX(cid:10)(cid:1) supµ, QXminµ∈[0,1](cid:5)(cid:4)(Qx)ϕu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µ0u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) µu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ(cid:1) λ.(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)= TIFinally, from µ0 > λ we know that QX({u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) > λ}) (cid:1) λ. (cid:1)5. Logical properties of linguistic quantifiersThe main purpose of this section is to establish various logical properties of linguistic quantifiers. In order topresent these properties in a compact way, several meta-logical notions are needed.Definition 28. Let ϕ ∈ Wff and Σ ⊆ Wff.(1) If for any interpretation I , TI (ϕ) (cid:2) 1(2) If for any interpretation I ,TI (ψ) (cid:1) TI (ϕ),infψ∈Σ2 , then ϕ is said to be fuzzily valid and we write |=Fuz ϕ.then ϕ is called a consequence of Σ and we write Σ |= ϕ. In particular, if ∅ |= ϕ, that is, TI (ϕ) = 1 for each interpre-tation I , then ϕ is said to be (absolutely) valid and we write |= ϕ.(3) If ϕ |= ψ and ψ |= ϕ, that is, for any interpretation I , TI (ϕ) = TI (ψ), then we say that ϕ and ψ are equivalentand write ϕ ≡ ψ .We first consider the question how the consequence relation is preserved by quantifiers and the question when canquantifiers distribute over conjunctions and disjunctions. The following proposition answers these two questions.Proposition 29. (1) Suppose that ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈ Wff. Then ϕ1 |= ϕ2 if and only if for any quantifier Q and for any individualvariable x, (Qx)ϕ1 |= (Qx)ϕ2 always holds.(2) For any quantifier Q and for any ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈ Wff, we have:(Qx)(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) |= (Qx)ϕ1 ∧ (Qx)ϕ2,(Qx)ϕ1 ∨ (Qx)ϕ2 |= (Qx)(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2).(3) If Q is a possibility quantifier, then for any ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈ Wff, we have:(cid:4)(Qx)(cid:5)ϕ1(x) ∨ ϕ2(x)≡ (Qx)ϕ1(x) ∨ (Qx)ϕ2(x).Proof. (1) The “only if” part is a direct corollary of Lemma 12(2). For the “if” part, let I be an interpretation and Xbe the domain of I . We want to show that TI (ϕ1) (cid:1) TI (ϕ2). We set QX = ΠπxI , where xI is the assignment of I tox, and ΠπxI is the fuzzy measure induced by the singleton possibility distribution πxI (see Example 4(1)). Then from(Qx)ϕ1 |= (Qx)ϕ2 and a simple calculation we know that(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ2= TI (ϕ2).TI (ϕ1) =(Qx)ϕ1= TI(cid:1) TI=(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)TI {./x}(ϕ2) ◦ ΠπxITI {./x}(ϕ1) ◦ ΠπxIM. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606593(2) is immediate from (1).(3) For any interpretation I , let X be the domain of I , then it follows thatTI(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:4)(Qx)(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2)= supλ∈[0,1]= supλ∈[0,1]= supλ∈[0,1]= supλ∈[0,1](cid:7)= max(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ1 ∨ (Qx)ϕ2(cid:10)λ, QXmin(cid:10)λ, QXmin(cid:4)(cid:10)QXλ, maxmin(cid:10)(cid:7)λ, QXminmax(cid:10)λ, QXmin(cid:5).supλ∈[0,1]= TI(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:5)u ∈ X: maxTI {u/x}(ϕ1), TI {u/x}(ϕ2)(cid:8)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ1) (cid:2) λ∪(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:2) λ(cid:7)u ∈ X : TI {u/x}(ϕ2) (cid:2) λ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ1) (cid:2) λu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ1) (cid:2) λu ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ2) (cid:2) λ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8), QX(cid:4)(cid:7)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ2) (cid:2) λ(cid:10)λ, QX, min(cid:10)λ, QXmin(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11), supλ∈[0,1]u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ2) (cid:2) λ(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ1) (cid:2) λ(cid:1)Second, we see how the consequence relation between two quantified propositions depends on the strength ofinvolved quantifiers.Proposition 30. Let Q1 and Q2 be two quantifiers. Then Q1 (cid:16) Q2 if and only if for any ϕ ∈ Wff, (Q1x)ϕ |= (Q2x)ϕalways holds.Proof. The “only if” part is obvious. For the “if” part, we only need to show that for any set X and for anyE ⊆ X, Q1X(E) (cid:1) Q2X(E). We can find some P ∈ Fn with n > 0 because it is assumed thatn=1 Fn (cid:9)= ∅. Letϕ = P (x, . . . , x) and consider the interpretation I in which the domain is X and(cid:1)∞P I (u1, . . . , un) =Then(cid:6)1,0,if u1 = · · · = un ∈ E,otherwise.(cid:4)(Q1x)ϕ(cid:5)TI(cid:10)mininfu∈F= supF ⊆X(cid:11)P I (u, . . . , u), QX(F )= supF ⊆EQX(F ) = Q1X(E)becauseP I (u, . . . , u) =infu∈F(cid:6)if F ⊆ E,1,0, otherwise.A similar calculation leads to TI((Q2x)ϕ) = Q2X(E). Since (Q1x)ϕ |= (Q2x)ϕ, we have TI ((Q1x)ϕ) (cid:1) TI ((Q2x)ϕ),and this completes the proof. (cid:1)Third, we show that a proposition with the meet or union of two quantifiers can be transformed to the conjunctionor disjunction, respectively, of the propositions with component quantifiers.Proposition 31. For any quantifiers Q1, Q2, individual variable x and ϕ ∈ Wff, we have:(1) ((Q1 (cid:17) Q2)x)ϕ ≡ (Q1x)ϕ ∧ (Q2x)ϕ;(2) ((Q1 (cid:18) Q2)x)ϕ ≡ (Q1x)ϕ ∨ (Q2x)ϕ.Proof. (1) For any interpretation I with domain X, it is clear that(cid:4)(Q1x)ϕ ∧ (Q2x)ϕ(Q1 (cid:17) Q2)x(cid:1) TI(cid:5)ϕ(cid:5).TI(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)Conversely, we have594M.

The above propositioncan be generalized to such general meet and union of quantifiers. To this end, we have to consider a generalization ofSugeno’s integral, which is obtained by replacing “min” in Definition 9 with a t-norm (see [38] for a detailed discusson such generalized Sugeno’s integrals).An inference scheme with linguistic quantifiers discussed in [25, Section 7] is as follows:(Q1x)ϕ1, . . . , (Qnx)ϕn(Qx)ϕ =?.The above proposition enables us to give a solution to this inference problem. Indeed, from the above proposition weknow that the following inference is valid:(Q1x)ϕ1, . . . , (Qnx)ϕn((Q1 (cid:17) · · · (cid:17) Qn)x)(ϕ1 ∨ · · · ∨ ϕn).However, it should be pointed out that such a solution is usually not optimal; more precisely, there may be somelogical formula ψ of the form (Qx)ϕ such that(cid:4)(Q1 (cid:17) · · · (cid:17) Qn)x(ϕ1 ∨ · · · ∨ ϕn),|= ψ →(cid:5)but(cid:4)(Q1 (cid:17) · · · (cid:17) Qn)x(cid:5)(ϕ1 ∨ · · · ∨ ϕn) → ψ|=does not hold.The next proposition indicates that quantifiers do not shed any influence on bound variables.M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606595Proposition 32. For any quantifier Q and for any ϕ, ψ ∈ Wff, if individual variable x is not free in ψ, then we have:(Qx)ϕ ∧ ψ ≡ (Qx)(ϕ ∧ ψ);(Qx)ϕ ∨ ψ ≡ (Qx)(ϕ ∨ ψ).Proof. We only demonstrate the first equivalence relation, and the second is similar. For any interpretation I , it holdsthat(cid:5)(cid:4)(Qx)(ϕ ∧ ψ)=TI(cid:9)TI,x(ϕ ∧ ψ) ◦ QX =(cid:11)(cid:10)TI {u/x}(ϕ), TI {u/x}(ψ)min◦ QX,(cid:9)where X is the domain of I . Since x is not free in ψ, it is easy to see that TI {u/x}(ψ) = TI (ψ) for every u ∈ X. WithLemma 12(3), we obtain(cid:5)(cid:4)(Qx)(ϕ ∧ ψ)(cid:26)TI {u/x}(ϕ) ◦ QX, TI (ψ)(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ ∧ ψ(cid:11)(cid:5), TI (ψ)(cid:10)= minTI= min(Qx)ϕ= TI(cid:5).(cid:25) (cid:9)TI(cid:1)(cid:4)To conclude this section, we observe the function of dual quantifiers. It is worth noting that the fuzzy validity |=Fuzin the following proposition cannot be strengthened by the stricter validity |=.Proposition 33. For any quantifier Q and for any ϕ ∈ Wff, it holds that∗|=Fuz∼ (Qx)ϕ ↔ (Qwhere Q∗ is the dual of Q.x) ∼ ϕ,Proof. We set∗ψ1 =∼ (Qx)ϕ → (Qx) ∼ ϕand∗ψ2 = (Qx) ∼ ϕ →∼ (Qx)ϕ.Then for each interpretation I with domain X, we have(cid:4)∗∼ (Qx)ϕ ↔ (QTIx) ∼ ϕ(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)= min,TI (ψ1), TI (ψ2)and it suffices to show that TI (ψ1) (cid:2) 1(cid:10)TI (ψ1) = maxTI(cid:25) (cid:9)(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ2 and TI (ψ2) (cid:2) 1∗, TI (Q(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)= maxTI {u/x}(ϕ) ◦ QX,x) ∼ ϕ(cid:9)(cid:5)(cid:4)1 − TI {u/x}(ϕ)(cid:26)∗◦ QX.2 . Furthermore, it holds thatIf(cid:9)TI {u/x}(ϕ) ◦ QX (cid:2) 12,then it is obvious that TI (ψ1) (cid:2) 1(cid:10)min(cid:11)TI {u/x}(ϕ), QX(F )supF ⊆Xinfx∈F(cid:9)=TI {u/x}(ϕ) ◦ QX <12.2 . Otherwise, with Lemma 10 we obtainFor any ε > 0, let F (ε) = {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) < 12}. Then for all u ∈ F (ε), 1 − TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) 12− ε, and(cid:4)(cid:5)1 − TI {u/x}(ϕ)infu∈F (ε)(cid:2) 12− ε.On the other hand, since X − F (ε) = {u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) 12+ ε}, it follows thatinfu∈X−F (ε)TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) 12+ ε.596Note that(cid:10)mininfx∈X−F (ε)TI {u/x}(ϕ), QXM.

Cardinal quantifiersThe studies on generalized quantifiers has traditionally been based on cardinalities [2,29,36]. The reason is thatwhen a quantified proposition is considered, what really concerns us is how many individuals satisfies the proposition,and it is usually irrelevant to know what are they concretely. Consequently, most methods of evaluating linguisticquantification in the previous literature are based on cardinalities of fuzzy sets too. Our fuzzy measure and Sugenointegral approach to linguistic quantifiers is in a sense presented in a wider framework in which no cardinality condi-tion is required. This section aims at clarifying the relationship between the semantics proposed in Section 4 and thecardinality-based semantics of linguistic quantifiers. To this end, we have to introduce a special class of quantifiers.Definition 35. A quantifier Q is called a cardinal quantifier if for any two nonempty sets X and X(cid:13), for any bijectionf : X → X(cid:13), and for any E ∈ ℘X with f (E) ∈ ℘(cid:13)X(cid:13) ,QX(E) = QX(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:4),f (E)where f (E) = {f (x): x ∈ E}.In the above definition, the requirement that f : X → X(cid:13) is a bijection implies that X and X(cid:13) has the same cardi-nality, and E and f (E) also has the same cardinality. Consider the following two quantified statements with the samequantifier Q: ϕ = “Q Xs are As” and ϕ(cid:13) = “Q X(cid:13)s are A(cid:13)s”. Suppose E is the set of elements in X that satisfy theproperty A, that is, E = {x ∈ X: x satisfies A}. Similarly, let E(cid:13) = {x ∈ X(cid:13): x satisfies A(cid:13)}. Then the condition in theabove definition means that ϕ and ϕ(cid:13) are equivalent provided X and X(cid:13) has the same cardinality and so do A and A(cid:13),no matter what are elements of X, X(cid:13), A and A(cid:13).The notion of generalized quantifier introduced in [45] is similar to cardinal quantifier with the only difference thatthe set of truth values was allowed to be any complete lattice in [45].The notion of cardinal quantifier has an equivalent and simplified definition given in terms of cardinal numbers.For any cardinal number α, we write m(α) for the set of all (increasing) functionsf : {cardinal number β: β (cid:1) α} → [0, 1]such that β1 (cid:1) β2 implies f (β1) (cid:1) f (β2).Definition 36. A numeric quantifier is a choice functionq : α (cid:14)→ qα ∈ m(α)of the class {m(α): α is a cardinal number}.For any cardinal quantifier Q, we define:|Q| : α (cid:14)→ |Q|α|Q|α(β) def= QX(E)for any cardinal number α,for any β (cid:1) α,598M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606where X is some set with |X| = α and E is some subset of X with |E| = β. From Definition 35 we know that Q iswell-defined, and it is a numeric quantifier. Thus, cardinal quantifier Q is represented by a numeric quantifier |Q|.Conversely, for each numeric quantifier q, we put[q]X(E) def= q|X|(cid:5)(cid:4)|E|for any nonempty set X, and for any E ⊆ X. It is easy to see that [q] is a cardinal quantifier, and thus numericquantifier q induces a cardinal quantifier [q].Example 37. The universal quantifier (∀) is not a cardinal quantifier because for an infinite set X, it is possible thatX has a proper subset E with |E| = |X|. The existential quantifier (∃) is a cardinal quantifier, and for any cardinalnumbers α, β with α (cid:1) β,(cid:6)|∃|α(β) =if β > 0,1,0, otherwise.The above example shows that the universal quantifier cannot be treated by the usual approach based on cardinalitywhen the discourse universe is infinite. This exposes indeed one of the advantages of our fuzzy measure approach tolinguistic quantifiers.In order to give another way of evaluating the truth value of a proposition with cardinal quantifier and to comparefuzzy measure semantics of linguistic quantifiers with others, we need the notion of consistency between two fuzzysets.Definition 38. Let X be a nonempty set, and let A, B be two fuzzy subsets of X. Then the consistency index of A andB is defined asCon(A, B) = supx∈X(cid:11)(cid:10)A(x), B(x)min.The notion of consistency was originally introduced by Zadeh in [55], and it have also been used by other authorsto serve as similarity measures between two fuzzy sets [58]. Moreover, the quantity 1 − Con(A, B) was introducedas inclusion grade of fuzzy set A in fuzzy set B (see [11, page 25]), where B is the complement of B, that is,B(x) = 1 − B(x) for each x ∈ X.A concept of fuzzy cardinality of fuzzy set is also needed.Definition 39. Let X be a nonempty set, and let A be a fuzzy subset of X. Then the fuzzy cardinality of A is definedto be the fuzzy subset FC(A) of {cardinal number α: α (cid:1) |X|} withFC(A)(α) = sup(cid:7)λ ∈ [0, 1]: |Aλ| = αfor any α (cid:1) |X|, where Aλ = {x ∈ X: A(x) (cid:2) λ} is the λ-cut of A.(cid:8)We give a simple example to illustrate the notion of fuzzy cardinality.Example 40. We adopt the Zadeh’s notation for fuzzy sets, that is, a fuzzy subset A of a set X is denoted by(cid:18)A =A(x)/x.x∈XLet X = {a1, a2, . . . , a10}. We consider the following fuzzy subset A of X:A = 0.9/a1 + 0.4/a2 + 0.7/a4 + 0.1/a5 + 0.82/a6 + 0.83/a7 + 0.9/a8 + 1/a9 + 1/a10.Then a routine calculation yieldsFC(A) = 1/2 + 0.9/4 + 0.83/5 + 0.82/6 + 0.7/7 + 0.4/8 + 0.1/9.M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606599It is easy to see that if A is a crisp set and |A| = α then FC(A) = 1/α (in Zadeh’s notation). Conversely, if X is afinite set, A is a fuzzy subset of X and FC(A) = 1/α, then A is a crisp set and |A| = α. This indicates that FC(·) is areasonable fuzzy generalization of the concept of cardinality for crisp sets.In the literature, there are mainly two ways of defining cardinalities of fuzzy sets. The first gives a (non-fuzzy) realnumber as the cardinality of a fuzzy set A; for example, if A is a fuzzy subset of a finite set X, then its sigma-count isdefined byΣCount(A) =(cid:18)A(x)x∈X(see [56]). In the second way, the cardinality of a fuzzy set A is defined to be a fuzzy subsets of nonnegative in-tegers, and typical examples are Zadeh’s FGCount(·), FLCount(·) and FECount(·) [56] and Ralescu’s card(·) [31].Obviously, FC(·) in Definition 39 is also given in the second way, but here we are concerned not only finite sets andinfinite cardinalities are allowed too. Moreover, even for the case of finite cardinalities, it is easy to observe that FC(·)is different from FGCount(·), FLCount(·), FECount(·) and card(·). We are not going to give a careful comparison ofthem.Now we are able to present the main result of this section. It clarifies the relation between our Sugeno integralsemantics of linguistic quantifiers and the usual approach based on cardinality.Proposition 41. If Q is a cardinal quantifier, then for any ϕ ∈ Wff and for any interpretation I , we have(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)(cid:4)= ConFC(cid:4)(cid:5)TI (ϕ)TI, |Q||X|(cid:5),where TI (ϕ) is considered as a fuzzy subset of X with TI (ϕ)(u) = TI {u/x}(ϕ) for all u ∈ X, and |Q| is the numericquantifier induced by Q.Proof.TI(cid:4)(Qx)ϕ(cid:5)= supλ∈[0,1]= supλ∈[0,1]= supλ∈[0,1](cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:10)λ, QXmin(cid:10)λ, |Q||X|min(cid:10)λ, |Q||X|min(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:11)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ(cid:4)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:7)u ∈ X: TI {u/x}(ϕ) (cid:2) λ(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:4)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:4)(cid:5)TI (ϕ)(cid:27)(cid:27)minλ(cid:11)(cid:10)λ, |Q||X|(α)(cid:11)λ, |Q||X|(α)(cid:11)(α), |Q||X|(α)= supα(cid:1)|X|= supα(cid:1)|X|= supλ(cid:1)|X|(cid:4)= ConFCsupλ∈[0,1] s.t |(TI (ϕ))λ|=α(cid:10)minsupλ∈[0,1] s.t |(TI (ϕ))λ|=α(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:10)FCTI (ϕ)min(cid:5)(cid:4)TI (ϕ), |Q||X|(cid:5).(cid:1)7. Some simple applicationsTo illustrate the utility of the Sugeno integral semantics of linguistic quantifiers, in this section we present threesimple examples.The first example is concerned with the weather in a week.Example 42. Recall from Example 16 that the quantifier Q = “many” is defined on a finite set X as follows:QX(E) =|E||X|for each E ⊆ X, where |E| is the cardinality of E. Let P1 = “to be cloudy” and P2 = “to be cold” be two (fuzzy)linguistic predicates. Consider the interpretation I in which the domain isX = {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday}600M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606Table 1Truth table of linguistic predicates P1 and P2SundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdayP I1P I20.1100.90.50.40.80.70.60.310.40.20Table 2Health condition of 10 studentsH (x)s10.73s20.1s30.95s41s50.84s60.67s70.7s80.9s91s100.81and the truth values of P1 and P2 are given in Table 1. Then the logical formula(cid:4)ϕ = (Qx)(cid:5)P1(x)∧ ∼ P2(x)means that “many days (in this week) are cloudy but not cold”, and its truth value under I isTI (ϕ) = maxE⊆X(cid:10)minminu∈E(cid:4)1 (u), 1 − P IP I2 (u)(cid:5)(cid:11)= 37≈ 0.43.The next example demonstrates applicability of Proposition 27 in health data summarization.Example 43. Consider a set X = {s1, s2, . . . , s10} consisting of 10 students. The respective health condition of thesestudents is indicated by Table 2, where the symbol H stands for the linguistic predicate “to be healthy”. We want to finda suitable linguistic quantifier from Q1 = “some”, Q2 = “at least three”, Q3 = “many”, Q4 = “most”, Q5 = “almostall” and Q6 = “all” to summarize the above data (see Examples 15 and 16 for the definitions of these quantifiers).In other words, we hope to have a high level description of the whole health condition of this group of students. It isrequired that such a summarization should hold with a high truth value, say, (cid:2) 0.7. From the above table, we have(cid:7)x ∈ X: H (x) (cid:2) 0.7(cid:8)E def== {s1, s3, s4, s5, s7, s8, s9, s10}andQ4X(E) =(cid:14)3/2(cid:13)|E||X|(cid:13)45=(cid:14)3/2> 0.7 >(cid:14)2(cid:13)45= Q5X(E).With Proposition 27 we know that(cid:4)(cid:5)(Q5x)H (x)(cid:4)(cid:5)(Q4x)H (x)> 0.7 > TITI,where I is the interpretation given according Table 2. So, what we can say is “most students are healthy”.We finally consider the problem of soft database queries. This kind of problems were handled in [23] by employingZadeh’s approach [56] to linguistic quantifiers. However, here we adopt the Sugeno integral semantics developed inthe previous sections.Example 44. Suppose that a record or entity is a list of attributes, a file is a collection of records of the same type, anda database is a collection of files of various types. Formally, a type is a tuple T = (x1, x2, . . . , xk) of attribute names.For each i (cid:1) k, we assume that the set of possible values of the attribute xi is Vi . Then a record of type T can bewritten asR = (x1 : a1, x2 : a2, . . . , xk : ak),where ai ∈ Vi is the value of attribute xi in this record for every i (cid:1) k. On the other hand, a (soft) query of type Tmay be formulated as follows:M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606601q = “find all records such that Q of the attributes out of{x1 is F1, x2 is F2, . . . , xk is Fk} match”,where Q is a linguistic quantifier, and for any i (cid:1) k, Fi is a given linguistic predicate which represents a (soft)constraint on the attribute xi and which can be defined as a fuzzy subset of Vi . We usually write the types of recordR and query q as Type(R) and Type(q), respectively. The above query can be expressed as a formula in our logicallanguage Lq:(cid:4)ϕ = (Qx)(cid:5)value(x) ∈ constraint(x),where x is an individual variable, both “value” and “constraint” are unary functions, and ∈ is a binary predicate. Wecan imagine that a record R and a query q give an interpretation I of the formula ϕ: the discourse universe is the typeT = {x1, x2, . . . , xk}, andvalueI (xi) = ai,constraintI (xi) = Fi,∈I (ai, Fi) = Fi(ai)for any i (cid:1) k, for any ai ∈ Vi and for any fuzzy subset Fi of Vi . Now the degree to which a record R matches thequery q is calculated as the truth value of the formula ϕ:(cid:9)Match(q, R) = TI (ϕ) =h ◦ QT ,where h(xi) = Fi(ai) for every i (cid:1) k. Furthermore, a database can be defined asD =m(cid:2)j =1Fj ,where Fj is a file of type Tj , that is, a set of some records with type Tj for each j (cid:1) m. Let λ be a pre-specifiedthreshold. If the matching degree of a record R and the query q exceeds λ, then R is introduced into the output fileof q. Therefore, the output file of query q is given asOUTPUT(q) =R ∈ D: Type(R) = Type(q) and Match(q, R) (cid:2) λ(cid:7)(cid:8).Let us now consider a concrete queryq = “find all records such that almost all of the attributes out of{x1 is small, x2 is small, x3 is big, x4 is around 4, x5 is big, x6 is very big,x7 is small, x8 is small, x9 is very small, x10 is very big} match”,where the type of q is T = {x1, x2, . . . , x10}. Assume that V1 = V2 = · · · = V10 = {1, 2, . . . , 8} and“small” = 1/1 + 0.8/2 + 0.3/3,“very small” = 1/1 + 0.64/2 + 0.09/3,“big” = 0.3/6 + 0.8/7 + 1/8,“very big” = 0.09/6 + 0.64/7 + 1/8,“around 4” = 0.3/2 + 08/3 + 1/4 + 0.8/5 + 0.3/6.Furthermore, we consider the following recordR = (x1 : 7, x2 : 2, x3 : 8, x4 : 3, x5 : 6, x6 : 6, x7 : 1, x8 : 2, x9 : 2, x10 : 7).The interpretation I determined by the record R and the query q is then given by Table 3.Using Lemma 11 it is routine to compute the matching degree of the record R to the query q:Match(q, R) =(cid:10)h ◦ almost allT = min0.64, almost allT(cid:4){x2, x3, x4, x7, x8, x9, x10}(cid:5)(cid:11)= 0.49,(cid:9)where the quantifier “almost all” is defined according to Example 16.602M.

DiscussionThe main aim of this section is to clarify further the relationship between the results obtained in this paper andrelated works.Zadeh [56] distinguished two kinds of fuzzy quantifiers, absolute quantifiers and relative quantifiers. An absolutequantifier refers to a (fuzzily defined) number such as “at least three”, “few” and “not very many”, while a relativequantifier refers to a proportion such as “most” and “at most half”. Then truth evaluation of quantified statementsis performed by calculating (absolute and relative) cardinalities of fuzzy sets. In this paper, however, evaluation ofquantification is directly done over subsets (not their cardinalities) of the discourse universe. This is different from theway considered in [56] and enables us not need to distinguish absolute and relative quantifiers.In [25], a linguistic quantifier is defined as a constraint on probability values, and it can be viewed as an alternativeform of imprecise probability. From the angle of mathematical representation, linguistic quantifiers dealt with in [25]can be identified with the relative quantifiers in [56], both being defined to be fuzzy subsets of the unit interval. Moreessentially, however, interpretations of quantifiers and reasoning mechanics with quantifiers in [25,56] are quite dif-ferent: in [25], a quantifier is treated in a probabilistic way and using the voting model, and reasoning with quantifiersis conducted by Bayesian method.The idea of representing linguistic quantifiers by fuzzy measures and Sugeno’s integrals was originally introducedby the author in [42], where some basic logical properties of linguistic quantifiers were presented, including a versionof Proposition 33. This paper is a continuation of [42], and indeed some part of the present paper can be seen asan elaboration of [42]. In 1994, Bosc and Lietard [4–7] proposed independently the idea of evaluating linguisticallyquantified propositions with Sugeno’s integrals. However, the motivations of [42] and [4–7] are quite different: themain aim of [42] is to establish a first order logic with fuzzy quantifiers, whereas in [4–7], a close connection betweenPrade and Yager’s approaches to the evaluation of fuzzy quantified statements and Sugeno and Choquet’s integrals [8]was found. The different motivations leads to some big differences between [42] (and this paper) and [4–7]. First, thediscourse universes considered in [4–7] are required to be finite. Indeed, in almost all previous approaches [1,4–7,9,10,12,15–18,20–23,25,27,28,30–33,39–41,56] to fuzzy quantification, only finite discourse universes are consideredbecause they are mainly application-oriented and usually in real applications finite universes are enough. In the currentpaper, however, infinite discourse universes are allowed. This enables us to have some deeper logical properties offuzzy quantifiers. Second, in [4–7] a fuzzy (absolute) quantifier Q over the universe X is still defined to be a fuzzysets of integers according to Zadeh [56]. Then a fuzzy measure mQ on X is induced by(cid:5)(cid:4)|E|mQ(E) = Qfor each E ⊆ X, where |E| is the cardinality of E, and Sugeno’s integrals with respect to mQ are used to evaluatepropositions quantified by Q. (In fact, the process that mQ is induced from Q is an inverse of the process afterDefinition 36 that a numeric quantifier is induced from a cardinal quantifier Q.) Thus, the fuzzy quantifiers dealt within [4–7] are all cardinal in the sense of Definition 36.Usually,two types of fuzzy quantified statements are identified, namely,type I proposition of the form“Q Xs are As” and type II statement of the form “Q Ds are As”, where X is the discourse universe, Q is a fuzzyquantifier, and A and D are two fuzzy predicates over X [27,28,56]. In this paper, for an elegant logical theory offuzzy quantifiers, we only consider type I propositions, and each type II proposition may be translated to a type Iproposition in the standard ways:“Q Ds are As” ⇔ “Q Xs (Xs are Ds implies Xs are As)”or“Q Ds are As” ⇔ “Q Xs are Ds and As”.M. Ying / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 581–606603The choice of translation methods is determined by the strength of quantifier Q. In general, for stronger quantifierssuch as the universal quantifier (∀) we adopt the first method, and for weaker quantifiers such as the existentialquantifier (∃) we use the second one.A list of desirable properties for fuzzy quantification was presented in [1,9,15–18]. Here, we briefly examine therelation between the most relevant ones and the results obtained in this paper. Independence of order in the elementsof the referential [1,15] is similar to the definition of cardinal quantifier (Definition 35). It is obvious that manyquantifiers do not enjoy this property. Example 25 shows that the Sugeno integral semantics of quantifiers satisfiesthe property of induced operators [1,15]. Furthermore, Example 26 shows that this semantics also satisfies coherencewith fuzzy logic and the property of correct generalization [1,9,15,32]. Delgado, Sanchez and Vila [9] proposed thatquantification evaluation must be not too “strict”. Precisely, this criterion requires that for any quantifier Q there is afuzzy predicate A such that the evaluation value of sentence “Q Xs are As” is neither 0 nor 1 provided Q is not a crispquantifier. It is easy to see that such a criterion is satisfied by the Sugeno integral semantics of quantifiers. Indeed, letQ be a quantifier and X a set such that there exists E0 ⊆ X with 0 < QX(E0) < 1. For any unary predicate symbol P ,we consider an interpretation I with X as its domain such that(cid:6)P I (u) =λ,0,if u ∈ E0,otherwise,where 0 < λ < 1. Then 0 < TI ((Qx)P (x)) = min(λ, QX(E0)) < 1. Propositions 29(1) and 30 indicates that bothquantifier monotonicity [1,9,15,32] and local monotonicity are valid in the framework presented in this paper. Con-vexity [1,15]. is then a direct corollary of local monotonicity. Type I to type II transformation [1,15,32]. is alreadydiscussed in the above paragraph. The property of decomposition [1] is given in Proposition 31(1). The property ofexternal negation [16] cannot be considered in the Sugeno integral semantics of quantifiers because the complementQ of a quantifier Q, defined by QX(E) = 1 − QX(E) for any E ⊆ X, does not fulfil the monotonicity in Definition 3and it is not a quantifier. The property of antonym [16] is not true in general. Proposition 33 presents a version of du-ality weaker than that required in [16]. In order to make its practical application possible, it was pointed out in [9,32]that the evaluation method of quantification should be efficient in the sense of computational complexity. Suppose thatthe domain of interpretation I is a finite set and its cardinality is n. At the first glance, we may think that the evaluationof the truth value TI ((Qx)ϕ) of the quantified formula (Qx)ϕ under I will run in exponential time with complexityO(2n) (cf. Definitions 9 and 23(ii) and Lemma 10). Fortunately, Lemma 11 provides us with an evaluation algorithmof quantification with complexity O(n log n).Continuity or smoothness in behavior [1,18] means that a small perturbation in the membership values of fuzzyproperties D or A does not give rise to a drastic change of the evaluation of fuzzy quantified proposition. This propertywarrants insensibility of fuzzy quantification to noise. A similar problem for compositional rule of fuzzy inferencewas addressed by the author in [48,52] where linguistic quantifiers were not involved. To give such a property, we firstneed to introduce a notion of distance between fuzzy sets. Let A and B be two fuzzy subsets of X. Then the distancebetween A and B is defined to be(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27).(cid:27)A(x) − B(x)d(A, B) = supx∈XThe following proposition exposes the continuity for our evaluation mechanism of fuzzy quantified statements.Proposition 45.

Indeed, we also have continuity with respect to perturbation of quantifiers. Let Q1 and Q2 be twoquantifiers and X a nonempty set. The distance of Q1 and Q2 on X is defined to bedX(Q1, Q2) = supE⊆X(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:27).(cid:27)Q1X(E) − Q2X(E)It is worth noting that this definition of distance between quantifiers is similar to variation distance between probabilitymeasures [19, page 108].Proposition 46. For any quantifiers Q1 and Q2, for any ϕ ∈ Wff, and for any interpretation I , we have:(cid:27)(cid:27)TI(cid:4)(Q1x)ϕ(cid:5)(cid:4)(Q2x)ϕ(cid:5)(cid:27)(cid:27) (cid:1) dX(Q1, Q2),− TIwhere X is the domain of I .Proof. Similar to Proposition 45. (cid:1)It should be pointed out that continuity cannot be expressed in our logical language Lq given in Section 4.9. ConclusionIn this paper, we present the Sugeno integral semantics of linguistic quantifiers in which a quantifier is representedby a family of fuzzy measures [35] and the truth value of a quantified proposition is computed by using Sugeno’sintegral [35]. Several elegant logical properties of linguistic quantifiers are derived, including a prenex normal formtheorem. This semantics is compared with the usual cardinality-based approaches (see for example [9,12,31,56]) tolinguistic quantifiers.Three simple applications to data summarization and database queries were presented in Section 7. Nevertheless,more applications are anticipated in other fields such as information fusion [21,25], decision making [20,40] andinductive learning [21].For further theoretical studies, we wish to examine carefully various model theoretic properties of the logic withlinguistic quantifiers and want to see whether it is axiomatizable. The mathematical tool used in this paper for ag-gregating truth values is the Sugeno integral. As mentioned after Definition 18 and Proposition 31, a generalizationof Sugeno’s integral was proposed in the previous literature by replacing the operation “min” in Definition 9 with ageneral t-norm, and this kind of generalized Sugeno’s integrals can also be used in our semantics of linguistic quanti-fiers. It seems that quantifications interpreted in terms of Sugeno’s integrals with t-norms allow us to aggregate data,information and knowledge in a “softer” and “more flexible” way. So, a careful examination of linguistic quantifiersmodeled by generalized Sugeno’s integrals would be another interesting topic. In addition, the Choquet integral iswidely used as an aggregation operator in economics, game theory and multi-criteria decision making. It is reasonableto expect that the Choquet integral can also be used to evaluate the truth values of linguistically quantified proposi-tions. Indeed, as pointed out in the last section, Bosc and Lietard [4–7] already noticed a connection between Pradeand Yager’s representation methods of linguistic quantifiers [30,39,41] and the Choquet integral. Thus, a systematicdevelopment of the Choquet integral semantics of linguistic quantifiers would also be an interesting topic.M.
