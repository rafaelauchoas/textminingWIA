Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia commonly occur in children and,after surgical treatment for OSA, it is estimated that up to 50% of children may continue to suffer from insomniasymptoms. Access to insomnia interventions following OSA treatment is limited as there are few programsavailable, few trained practitioners to deliver these programs, and limited recognition that these problems exist.The current study involved the usability testing of an internet-based parent-directed session of BNBD tailoredtowards the needs of children (ages 4–10 years) who experience residual insomnia symptoms after treatment ofOSA. This new session was added to the BNBD program. Participants (n = 43) included 6 parents, 17 sleepexperts, and 20 front-line healthcare providers who completed and provided feedback on the new session.Participants completed a feedback questionnaire, with both quantitative and qualitative questions, after re-viewing the session. Quantitative responses analyzed via descriptive statistics suggested that the session wasprimarily viewed as helpful by most participants, and open-ended qualitative questions analyzed by contentanalyses generated a mix of positive and constructive feedback. The results provide insights on how to optimallytailor the BNBD program to meet the needs of the target population and suggest that testing the session on alarger scale would be beneficial.1. IntroductionInsomnia has a significant impact on children's daily functioningand development (Curcio et al., 2006; Paavonen et al., 2000) andprevious studies suggest that there are significant barriers to accessingpediatric behavioural sleep interventions (Boerner et al., 2013; Honaker& Meltzer, 2016). Better Nights, Better Days (BNBD) is an interactive 5-session, parent-directed eHealth program intended to share psychoe-ducation and behavioural strategies about insomnia in 1–10-year-oldchildren (Corkum et al., 2016). Sessions focus on the importance ofsleep and consequences of poor sleep (Session 1), healthy sleep prac-tices (Session 2), falling asleep independently (Session 3), stayingasleep through the night, reducing early morning awakenings, andensuring adequate napping for younger children (Session 4), and a re-view of progress combined with future goal setting (Session 5). Thefocus of the current study was a usability test of a new session of BNBDtailored for the specific needs of parents of children ages 4–10 yearswho had previously been surgically treated for Obstructive Sleep Apnea(OSA).OSA involves a narrowing or obstruction of the upper airway duringsleep resulting in ventilatory disturbances, caused either by adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy (Capdevila et al., 2008) or obesity (Capdevilaet al., 2008; Gaines et al., 2018; Patinkin et al., 2017), and results insleep disturbance and daytime impairment (Rosen, 2010). Snoring,gasping, and choking are the most common nighttime symptoms of OSAfor children (Dehlink and Tan, 2016; Trosman, 2013). The con-sequences of OSA are significant and can include psychosocial problemssuch as behavioural dysregulation (Blechner and Williamson, 2016;Owens, 2009), cognitive and school-related problems (Gozal, 2009;Hunter et al., 2016; Xanthopoulos et al., 2015), as well as increased riskof physical problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, andobesity (Framnes and Arble, 2018).OSA is often thought of as an adult disorder; however, the disorderis common among children, with a prevalence of 1–5% (Lumeng and⁎Corresponding author at: 1355 Oxford Street, P.O.

While the primary risk factor foradult OSA is male gender and obesity (Gaines, Vgontzas, Fernandez-Mendoza, & Bixler, 2018; Qaseem et al., 2014), the primary contributorto pediatric OSA is enlarged adenoids or tonsils (i.e., adenotonsillarhypertrophy) (Erler and Paditz, 2004; Rosen, 2010). Various other riskfactors have been described including asthma, allergies, prematurity,ethnicity, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Erler andPaditz, 2004; Redline et al., 1999; Rosen, 2010). Prevalence rates arehighest when children are 3–6 years old, a period during which thetonsils and adenoids are largest relative to the size of the upper airway(Ahn, 2010; Li et al., 2016; Sheldon et al., 2014). Due to the risks as-sociated with childhood OSA, early identification and treatment areessential (Marcus et al., 2012). Adenotonsillectomy (AT; surgical re-moval of adenoids and tonsils) is recommended as the first-line treat-ment for childhood OSA (Cielo and Gungor, 2016; Tan et al., 2016;Trosman, 2013).Previous research indicates that many children continue to havesleep disturbances after adenotonsillectomy. This can in part be un-derstood by the high comorbidity rate between OSA and insomnia (Al-Jawder and BaHammam, 2012; Lack and Sweetman, 2016). Insomniainvolves problems initiating sleep, staying asleep, or waking too early(American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014). Preliminary researchindicates a rate of comorbidity among children of approximately 30%(Kukwa et al., 2016; Owens et al., 1998); however, to date, little re-search has been conducted on this comorbidity in children (Byars et al.,2011). Children with comorbid OSA and insomnia, like children withjust OSA, tend to undergo adenotonsillectomy as a first-line treatmentfor their sleep-related issues. While adenotonsillectomy may success-fully treat OSA, it has been reported that > 50% of children with co-morbid insomnia and OSA may continue to have insomnia symptomsafter recovering from surgery (i.e., six months post-OSA surgery)(Chervin et al., 2014), meaning that approximately 15% of all kids withOSA may continue to have insomnia after treatment for OSA. The causeof this is likely multifaceted, but one potential cause is that apnea-re-lated episodes can result in difficulties falling asleep and contribute tonight awakenings, establishing a behavioural pattern which continueseven after adenotonsillectomy (Byars et al., 2011).Even though it is common for insomnia to persist after OSA treat-ment, research on the effectiveness of treatments for residual insomniais limited (Björnsdóttir et al., 2013; Manickam et al., 2015). Insomnia isless likely to be screened for in the context of OSA (Byars et al., 2011),and as such, insomnia may continue to present itself even after OSA hasbeen treated. Thus, treatments should be explored for children withtreated OSA who continue to suffer from insomnia after recoveringfrom adenotonsillectomy.Behaviouralinterventions are the recommended treatmentforchildren with insomnia (Vriend and Corkum, 2011; Meltzer andMindell, 2014; Morgenthaler et al., 2006; Taylor and Roane, 2010),however, in-person treatment is often difficult to access due to factorssuch as finances, transportation, or a general lack of available services(i.e., behavioural(Speth et al., 2015).eHealth interventionsinterventions delivered via the internet) have become increasinglypopular over the last decade, as they improve accessibility. eHealthinterventions designed for a wide range of children's mental and phy-sical health issues have been shown to be an effective and cost-savingalternative to providing children with in-person treatment (Cushing andSteele, 2010). While there are no published eHealth interventions forinsomnia in school-aged children, there is preliminary evidence de-monstrating that distally provided behavioural interventions can im-prove sleep in children with insomnia (Corkum et al., 2016); however,such interventions are not tailored towards the unique needs of childrenwith ongoing sleep problems after OSA treatment.The primary research question of the current usability study wasfocused on determining the overall usability and general need of theOSA-tailored session by collecting feedback from relevant stakeholders.An additional goal of the current study was to collect feedback fromparents, sleep experts and healthcare providers (HCPs) to help de-termine the general need for the tailored session. A randomized controltrial (RCT) was recently completed to evaluate the effectiveness ofBNBD (Corkum et al., 2018); therefore, it was not necessary to re-evaluate the whole program, but rather focus on the new OSA-tailoredsession. The OSA-tailored session was added to the front-end of BNBDfor parents to complete before BNBD itself and includes psychoeduca-tion about OSA, the reasons for the comorbidity between OSA and in-somnia, and an elaboration of how insomnia symptoms can be pro-blematic even after OSA treatment (Table 1). Feedback collected for thecurrent usability study design was based on Peter Morville's “user ex-perience honeycomb” model which postulates that multiple usabilityfactors (i.e., usefulness, usability, desirability, valuableness, accessi-bility, and credibility) work together to create a meaningful online userexperience (Morville and Sullenger, 2010). To test the OSA-tailoredsession, we collected qualitative and quantitative feedback from par-ents, sleep experts, and front-line HCPs. Based on the usability studyfeedback, we expected that qualitative and quantitative feedback wouldbe primarily positive across all participant groups, and that feedbackwould provide useful information to guide modifications for the ses-sion.2. Method2.1. ParticipantsThe sample of the current study consisted of stakeholders in theOSA-tailored session of BNBD (n = 43). Stakeholders included parents(n = 6), sleep experts (n = 17), and front-line HCPs (n = 20).2.1.1. ParentsThe parent group included primary caregivers of typically-devel-oping children who had received successful surgical treatment for OSA.Children were included if they had undergone surgery 6 to 18 monthsprior to recruitment. The ages of children ranged from 4 to 10 years(M = 6.17). The timeframe of surgery relative to the beginning of the2M. Orr, et al.Internet Interventions 18 (2019) 100265study was chosen to give children enough time to recover from theprocedure, but not enough time for adenoids to regrow and have arecurrence of symptoms (which can happen in roughly 7% of children;Babademez et al., 2017). To meet inclusion criteria, parents and theirchildren had to reside in Canada, the child had to have undergonesuccessful removal of the adenoids and/or tonsils for OSA 6–18 monthsprior, OSA symptoms were resolved, and the child had to present withresidual insomnia. Finally, all parents were expected to have ongoinginternet and email access for the study duration, and to be comfortablewith reading at a grade 8 level. Parents who self-reported cognitive orphysical issues that could interfere with their online participation wereexcluded. Additionally, parents of children with developmental orneurodevelopmental problems, as reported by parents, were excluded.Of the 16 parents who expressed interest in the study, seven werenot eligible due to the child not meeting criteria for insomnia (n = 3),presenting with a neurodevelopmental disorder (n = 2), or presentingwith residual OSA symptoms (n = 2). Additionally, three parents didnot begin or did not finish their review of the session, resulting in a finalsample of six parents who completed the study. Demographics are re-ported for the five parents who submitted demographic information(see Table 2). The sample was mostly comprised of mothers, with a highlevel of education and income, and who were employed full-time. Thechildren had a mean age of six and half years, three of the five childrenwere male, and most were living in two-parent homes with a sibling inan urban area. The parent sample was all Caucasian and English-Table 2Demographics for parents.Parent characteristicsAge (in years)Relationship to childMotherFatherEthnicityWhite/CaucasianEducationMaster'sBachelor'sSome universitySome collegeEmployment statusFull-timeHomemakerStudentChild characteristicsAge (in years)SexFemaleMaleEthnicityWhite/CaucasianFamily characteristicsChildren at homeOneTwoThreeAdults at homeOneTwoPrimary languageEnglishGross household income$150,000+$100,000–$124,999$80,000–$99,999$10,000–$14,999Community descriptionCity under 500,000 peopleRuralCount (%)Mean (SD)Range38.4 (6.47)27–436.2 (2.56)4–104 (80%)1 (20%)5 (100%)2 (40%)1 (20%)1 (20%)1 (20%)3 (60%)1 (20%)1 (20%)2 (40%)3 (60%)5 (100%)1 (20%)3 (60%)1 (20%)2 (40%)3 (60%)5 (100%)1 (20%)1 (20%)2 (40%)1 (20%)3 (60%)2 (40%)Note.

Sleep expertsThe sleep experts group included registered HCPs in Canada whospecialized in pediatric OSA or sleep disorders and had 50% or more oftheir clinical work or research pertaining to sleep medicine. They werealso required to have ongoing internet and email access for studyduration and could not report any cognitive or physical issues thatwould impede their online participation.Of the 19 sleep experts who expressed interest in the study, one wasnot eligible due to not seeing children as part of their regular clinicalpractice. Additionally, one sleep expert did not finish reviewing thesession, resulting in a final sample of 17 sleep experts who completedthe study. Sleep experts were comprised of pediatricians (n = 7), psy-(n = 2), nurseschiatrists(n = 2), sleep technicians (n = 2), one psychologist, and one neurolo-gist. Most of the sample was female, had medical or graduate training,were working in the field for over 10 years, and worked in a hospitalsetting. While there was variability in clinical practice, all had some oftheir practice dedicated to working with children with OSA. See Table 3for further information about sleep expert and HCP characteristics.respirologists/otolaryngologists(n = 2),2.2.1. Front-line HCPsThis group included HCPs in Canada who occupied varioushealthcare-related roles. This category included HCPs who saw childrenwith a range of problems but who did not specialize in pediatric sleepdisorders within their clinical practice. Their clinical work or researchwith sleep would have made up < 50% of their professional activities.Like parents and sleep experts, HCPs were required to have ongoinginternet and email access for the study duration and could not reportany cognitive or physical issues that would impede their online parti-cipation.Of the 24 HCPs who expressed interest in the study, one was noteligible due to not seeing children with sleep problems in regularclinical practice. Additionally, three HCPs did not complete the feed-back questionnaire, resulting in 20 HCPs completing the study. HCPswere comprised of psychologists (n = 8), pediatricians (n = 3), generalmedical practitioners (n = 3), psychiatrists (n = 3), nurses (n = 2), anda social worker. Most HCPs were female, had medical or professionalgraduate training, worked for over 10 years in their respective fields,and saw children with sleep problems in either a hospital or privatepractice setting, and children with sleep problems only comprised1–10% of their clinical practice. Most had worked with 10 or fewerchildren with treated or untreated OSA. See Table 3 for further in-formation about sleep expert and HCP characteristics.2.3. Measures2.3.1. Screening and demographic measures2.3.1.1. Screening Questionnaire - Parents (SQ-P). The SQ-P is a 21-itemquestionnaire used to determine parents' eligibility for the study. Itreviewed inclusion criteria such as ability to actively participate in theonline components, ability to appropriately communicate in English,and a preliminary exclusion of developmental and neurodevelopmentaldisorders in parents' children.2.3.1.2. BehaviouralInsomnia Questionnaire (BIQ). The BIQ is anauthor-created, 23-item questionnaire completed by parents which isused to confirm the presence of insomnia symptoms in their child.Questions pertained to bedtime, number of nighttime awakenings,morning wake up time, bedtime routines, and related issues withsleep. It focused on both the quality and quantity of sleep and wasbased on pediatric insomnia criteria proposed by Anders and Dahl(2007).M.

One HCP endorsed > 50% of clinical work devoted to sleep disorders,however she also noted that sleep problems were not a primary focus of herpractice. Sleep issues were typically assessed and managed in the context ofother issues that were more pertinent to her clinical practice. As such, thisparticipant was grouped as an HCP.Note. One HCP endorsed no regular experience with any sleep disorders (0%);however, she noted having exposure to children with sleep disorders in the past.As such, she was included in the final sample.2.3.1.3. Health-Related Questionnaire - Modified (HRQ-M). The parent-completed HRQ-M is an author-created, 37-item questionnaire aboutOSA, neurodevelopmental disorders, other mental health disorders, andsleep disorders. It was primarily used to identify the presence ofdisorders which would make the child ineligible for this study (e.g.,neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, mental health disorderssuch as depression, or sleep disorders such as narcolepsy).2.3.1.4.

Usability measures2.3.2.1. Session Feedback Questionnaire - Parents (SFQ-P). The SFQ-P isa 35-item questionnaire that consisted of 26 closed-ended and 9 open-ended questions about the usefulness, usability, desirability, value,accessibility, and credibility of the OSA-tailored session, as well asabout participants'the videos and features (e.g.,worksheets and supplemental materials) and the general readiness ofthe session for end users. The questionnaire was based on PeterMorville's user experience honeycomb (Morville and Sullenger, 2010)and adapted from questions used in a previous usability studyevaluating the original BNBD intervention (Speth et al., 2015). TheSFQ-P was completed at the end of the OSA-Insomnia session toevaluate participants' experience with the new session. Closed-endedquestions were rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (e.g., “StronglyAgree” to “Strongly Disagree”) or 1–3 (e.g., “Yes”, “Maybe”, “No”) tocapture levels of agreement with each aspect of the session. Responseswhich agreed with the presented statements (i.e., “Agree”, “StronglyAgree”, and “Yes”) were considered positive responses. Open-endedquestions offered participants the opportunity to elaborate more4M.

Session Feedback Questionnaire - Sleep Experts & HCPs(SFQ-SE & HCP). The SFQ-SE & HCP are both 40-item questionnairesthat are almost identical to the SFQeP, but the wording of the questionsfocused on participants' thoughts about the OSA-tailored session forparents rather than for their own use of the session. This questionnaireincluded reworded versions of the 35-items from the SFQeP, plus 4additional open-ended questions to obtain feedback on potentialadditions, deletions, changes, and general readiness of the sessionfrom a professional/expert perspective. The questionnaire also addedone closed-ended question asking participants to rate the general needfor the session on a three-point scale (“Yes”, “Maybe”, “No”).2.4. ProcedureParents were recruited through direct mailing in collaboration withthe Otolaryngology Department of a local children's hospital.Specifically, surgical records were accessed to identify 3-to-10-year-oldchildren who had tonsils and/or adenoids removed for OSA in the past6 to 18 months. Five-hundred potentially eligible parents were thenmailed the study flyer. Sleep experts and HCPs were recruited throughprofessional connections, BNBD social media (Facebook), and postingson websites of relevant organizations (e.g., the Canadian Sleep Society).All potential participants expressed interest in the study by in-itiating email correspondence with the study investigators. Interestedparents were then emailed a link to an online Screening Questionnaire.If eligible, parents progressed to a consent form detailing study proce-dures and requirements. Subsequently, they completed the BIQ andHRQ-M. Interested sleep experts and HCPs were also emailed a linkdirectly to a consent form and a subsequent demographic form (elig-ibility was confirmed at this step). All screening and demographicmeasures were hosted on REDCap©, a secure online survey program.All participants were then emailed a link to the OSA-Insomnia session.After finishing the OSA-Insomnia session, participants completedthe Session Feedback Questionnaire which was housed on Opinio, anonline survey program. Participants were emailed a $30.00 gift card toAmazon.ca as an honorarium following their participation in the study.2.5. Data analysisThe responses on the Feedback Questionnaires resulted in bothquantitative and qualitative data. Descriptive statistics (percentages)were calculated for quantitative questions, while qualitative data wereanalyzed and interpreted using directed content analysis (Assarroudiet al., 2018), which allows coding within an existing framework.Qualitative data was organized using Microsoft Word, and quantitativedata was analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 (released 2016) and MicrosoftExcel. Codes were created within Morville's ‘honeycomb’ categories(e.g., “usefulness”, “desirability”) (Morville and Sullenger, 2010) andother relevant elements of the session (features, readiness, generalneed). Coding units involved words, clauses, and complete sentences.Two coders independently coded the feedback in two rounds. The firstround involved coding units into nine categories based on Morville'scategories (Morville and Sullenger, 2010) and the second round in-volved placing coded units into two broader categories (strengths andchallenges) for the purpose of analysis. Discrepancies were resolved bymutual agreement. Inter-rater reliability was calculated for both roundsby looking at percent agreement between raters. Agreement of 98.6%was obtained for the first round of coding and an agreement of 99.2%was obtained for the second round of coding.Open-endedquestions wereFeedbackQuestionnaires to help further understand the quantitative ratings. Theopen-ended questions resulted in 368 units of feedback provided aboutthe OSA-Insomnia session. Within each of Morville's “honeycomb”includedtheincategories and other areas of feedback, two categories were generatedto describe feedback: strengths and challenges. Strengths referred to po-sitive aspects of the session, and challenges pertained to practical bar-riers regarding the session's usability and need, as well as suggestionsfor improvement. Feedback provided by sleep experts and HCPs wasincluded in the analysis if the same point (e.g., adding more videos tothe session) was noted in > 10% of the responses in a given responsecategory (e.g., challenges/usefulness), after accounting for opposingfeedback within the response category which nullified correspondingfeedback (e.g., one sleep expert stating that more videos would bebeneficial and one saying that less videos would be beneficial resultingin null data), and if the feedback was provided by more than one par-ticipant. Since parents were the primary stakeholders in the currentstudy and a small sample of parents participated, all feedback fromparents was included in the analysis.3. ResultsA summary of the survey results is provided below, with thequantitative results followed by the qualitative results. Additional de-tails are presented in Table 4. Questions are grouped based on theconcept they were designed to assess (e.g., usefulness, usability, desir-ability). The following sections also describe primary strengths andchallenges mentioned by each group. There were 151 total units offeedback for strengths and 217 total units for challenges. Parents pro-vided 7 units of feedback for strengths and 14 units for challenges re-sulting in 21 total units. Sleep experts provided 56 units of feedback forstrengths and 89 units for challenges resulting in 145 total units. HCPsprovided 88 units of feedback for strengths and 114 units for challengesresulting in 202 total units. Below is a summary of the qualitativefeedback. Additional detailed feedback, including quotes from partici-pants, is presented in a supplementary table (Table S5).3.1. UsefulnessWhen asked if the session provided information that would helpparents better understand their child's ongoing sleep problems fol-lowing OSA treatment, all parents (6/6), 94.1% (16/17) of sleep ex-perts, and 90% (18/20) of HCPs responded positively. When asked ifthis session helps parents to understand why insomnia and OSA arerelated, all parents (6/6), 94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts, and 90% (18/20) of HCPs responded positively. All three participant groups reportedthat a primary strength of this session related to the description of howOSA and insomnia can be linked. Regarding challenges, all three groupssuggested reducing the length of the session to highlight the most re-levant information. Sleep experts and HCPs emphasized how the sessioncan devote less time to the assessment and symptoms of OSA, given thatthe program is catering to parents of children whose OSA has alreadybeen treated. Additionally, all groups suggested specific useful addi-tions to the session such as information about parental sleep issues.Furthermore, sleep experts and HCPs stressed the importance of furtherelucidating the connection between OSA and insomnia. Finally, sleepexperts highlighted the need for parents to ensure OSA is diagnosedcorrectly, given limitations to overnight polysomnography assessments(e.g., waitlists, cost), and that the session content would be increasinglyhelpful if opened to families with current OSA as well. They suggestedincluding this information in the session, alongside additionalin-formation that would help parents identify residual OSA symptoms (ifpresent).3.2. UsableMost parents (66.7%; 4/6), sleep experts (94.1%; 16/17), and HCPs(90%; 18/20) responded positively when asked if parents would findthis session to be user-friendly.

Finally, all parents (6/6), 70.6% (12/17) of sleepexperts, and 90% (18/20) of HCPs responded positively when asked ifthe session would take a reasonable amount of time for parents to re-view. All three groups provided strengths pertaining to how the in-formation was user-friendly, well-organized, and generally easy to na-vigate. However, all three groups also provided helpful feedback abouthow to improve the usability of the session. Challenges noted by allgroups involved technical problems, some of which create barriers formost online programs (e.g., mobile accessibility, browser compatibility,and speed) and some of which may represent more idiosyncratic issuesinherent in the current session (e.g., pages randomly displaying errormessages). Sleep experts and HCPs also provided suggestions about thelayout of the session to enhance user-friendliness (e.g., including a large‘menu’ button).3.3. Desirability66.7% (4/6) of parents, all sleep experts (17/17), and 80% (16/20)of HCPs responded positively when asked if the session is visually ap-pealing and the organization of information on the screen was clear. Forstrengths, all three groups emphasized how the session provided in-formation that was eye-catching and generally visually appealing, byhighlighting different characteristics of the session that were broughttogether to create an enjoyable user experience. In particular, most ofthe sleep expert feedback was positive; they focused on the general7M. Orr, et al.Internet Interventions 18 (2019) 100265visual appeal and logical progression of the session. Challenges per-tained to certain preferences noted by each group that would optimizethe visual appeal and progression of the session. Sleep experts and HCPsfocused on the inclusion of more videos coupled with a reduction ofwritten text, while parents provided a contrasting view involving apreference for written material.3.4. AccessibilityAll parents (6/6), 88.2% (15/17) of sleep experts, and all HCPs (20/20) responded positively when asked if parents will think this sessionwill be easy to follow and if they will be able to absorb all the necessaryinformation. Furthermore, 82.4% (14/17) of sleep experts and 95%(19/20) of HCPs responded positively when asked if parents will beable to easily navigate the session and find all the relevant information.All three groups noted strengths pertaining to the session being a helpfulresource for parents. Further, all groups described how the method ofdelivery made the session particularly engaging for families. HCPs alsofocused on how the session would generally be able to increase acces-sibility for parents with limited time or resources. However, all groupsalso noted accessibility-related challenges. Notably, sleep experts andHCPs suggested scaling back the reading level and medical jargonembedded throughout the session. Sleep experts also noted how lan-guage options and additional accommodations, such as subtitles onvideos, would make the session more accessible. Finally, certain sleepexperts and HCPs expressed concerns that the length of the session maybe a barrier to parents completing the full session and absorbing therelevant information. Parents seemed to think the session was an ap-propriate length, however one parent expressed interest in movingquickly through the OSA session to start learning about insomniatechniques.3.5. Features83.3% (5/6) of parents, all sleep experts (17/17), and 90% (18/20)of HCPs responded positively when asked if parents would find thevideos in this session helpful. Moreover, 83.3% (5/6) of parents, 94.1%(16/17) of sleep experts, and 85% (17/20) of HCPs responded posi-tively when asked if parents would find the activities in the sessionhelpful. In addition, all parents (6/6), and 94.1% (16/17) of sleep ex-perts and 95% (19/20) of HCPs responded positively when asked ifparents would find the written summary of the content helpful. Finally,66.7% (4/6) of parents, 58.8% (10/17) of sleep experts, and 75% (15/20) of HCPs responded positively when asked if parents would findadditional videos from sleep and OSA specialists to be a helpful addi-tion to the program. Feedback primarily pertained to which featureswere the most preferred. This feedback was mixed, but primarystrengths related to the helpful and engaging combination of features(e.g., the mix of videos and written text), and how this array of featureswas able to increase understanding of the material. HCPs noted howfeatures were specifically helpful with clarifying the connection be-tween OSA and insomnia. Consistent challenges were noted across allgroups such as technical issues with features, and a general desire forthe session to re-balance its ratio of audio and visual features. Allgroups mentioned how they would like to see more information aboutcertain topics in videos and other features (e.g., the insomnia/OSAconnection), and they also addressed areas they believed could be re-duced in videos and related features (e.g., assessment and symptoms ofOSA).3.6. ValuablenessAll parents (6/6), 94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts, and all HCPs (20/20) responded positively when asked if the information provided in thissession would be valuable to parents. In addition, all parents (6/6),94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts, and 85% (17/20) of HCPs respondedpositively when asked if the session would provide parents with adeeper understanding of why children continue to experience insomniaafter OSA treatment. As well, all parents (6/6), all sleep experts (17/17), and 95% (19/20) of HCPs responded positively when asked ifparents would find the review of OSA to be valuable. Similarly, allparents (6/6), 88.2% (15/17) sleep experts, and 85% (17/20) HCPsresponded positively when asked if parents will find the informationabout assessing and treating OSA to be valuable. Finally, all parents (6/6), 94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts, and all HCPs (20/20) respondedpositively when asked if parents would find the connection betweenOSA and insomnia to be helpful.Regarding strengths, sleep experts and HCPs stated how the sessionwould be valuable for clinicians to share with families and children.They addressed the general need for the session by noting that it wouldbe valuable for other stakeholders, such as teachers, who regularly in-teract with children and parents about sleep difficulties. Parents alsofound that session content was particularly valuable when key pointswere repeated. However, all groups noted challenges that deserve at-tention. HCPs and parents suggested improving the value of the sessionby including interviews with physicians and testimonials from parents.Finally, certain sleep experts discussed how the value of the session maybe diminished due to systemic issues within the healthcare and medicalsystem that may delay identification of insomnia and the subsequentreferral to behavioural treatment for this population (even in the case ofan online intervention).3.7. CredibilityAll parents (6/6), 70.6% (12/17) of sleep experts, and 95% (19/20)of HCPs responded positively when asked if parents will believe that theinformation provided in the session comes from a reputable source. Allthree groups generated credibility feedback that was primarily positive.Particular noted strengths pertained to the reputability of the informa-tion, the experience of the researchers, and the lack of bias inherent inthe session. However, for challenges, sleep experts and HCPs providedhelpful suggestions on how to bolster the session's credibility, such asthe inclusion of information at the outset of the session, or in videos,that explicitly describes the credentials and experience of the re-searchers. Parents mentioned no challenges for credibility.3.8. General readinessHalf of parents (3/6), and 70.6% (12/17) of sleep experts and 75%(15/20) of HCPs responded with “Extremely Ready” or “Very Ready”when asked how ready the session is for use with parents of childrenwith insomnia and treated OSA. When asked if there is a satisfactoryamount of information about OSA in the session, 66.7% (4/6) of par-ents, 94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts, and 95% (19/20) of HCPs said“Yes”. When asked if there is a satisfactory amount of informationabout the link between OSA and insomnia in the session, 83.3% (5/6) ofparents, 88.2% (15/17) of sleep experts, and 80% (16/20) of HCPs said“Yes”. When asked if anything should generally be added to the session,33.3% (2/6) parents, 58.8% (10/17) sleep experts, and 15% (3/20)HCPs said “No”. Similarly, when asked if anything should generally bechanged in the session, 5/6 parents (83.3%) said “No”, however only47.1% (8/17) of sleep experts and 65% (13/20) of HCPs said “No”.When asked if anything should generally be deleted from the session,66.7% (4/6) of parents, 70.6% (12/17) of sleep experts, and 65% (15/20) of HCPs said “No”. Most of the information about the session'sGeneral Readiness was addressed in previous sections of qualitativefeedback (e.g., Usefulness, Usability, and Desirability). However, somecomments still pertained to the general readiness of the session for usewith parents such as “Could be used as [is] and be beneficial, but op-portunities for improvement are present” (HCP) and “I think it's readyto go!” (HCP). Parents, approximately half of which reported that theyfelt the session was ready for end users, suggested that “hearing parent8M. Orr, et al.testimonies would be great”.3.9. General needOnly sleep experts and HCPs were asked about the general need forprogram, as this question was added due to ongoing difficulties re-cruiting parents. When asked if there is a general need for the program,94.1% (16/17) of sleep experts and 85% (17/20) of HCPs said “Yes”.Prior to reviewing the session, sleep experts were also asked to estimatethe percentage of children who would have issues with insomnia aftersurgery for OSA. On average, sleep experts estimated that 11–20%(Mode = 1–10%, Range = 0–70%) and HCPs estimated that 21–30%(Mode = 1–10%, Range = 0–80%) of children would have residual in-somnia. Most of the information about the session's General Need wasaddressed in previousfeedback (e.g.,Valuableness). Feedback involved comments about the beneficial valueof the session for various stakeholders, combined with Expert and HCPconcerns about the small size of the target population and their ownlack of related experience with the population. Particularly, sleep ex-perts and HCPs believed that the session would only be valuable for asmall and specialized sample.sections of qualitative4. DiscussionBased on this usability study, the OSA-tailored session was posi-tively received by participants and useful information for future pro-gram development was obtained. The session was generally viewed as awell-tailored version of insomnia treatment in the context of treatedOSA. The vast majority of participants responded positively when askedto rate their experience with all aspects of the program. Primarystrengths of the OSA-Insomnia session were reported to be the useful-ness of the information, the design and features of the session, the in-creased accessibility, and the general value for clinicians and parentsalike. Examples of qualitative feedback indicating a generally positiveappraisal of the session can be found in Table S5.Feedback from sleep experts and HCPs also supports the generalneed for the session. While most participants endorsed a theoreticalneed for this program by suggesting that many children might haveunrecognized residual insomnia (94.1% of sleep experts and 85% ofHCPs said “Yes” when asked if there is a general need for the program),some provided qualitative feedback which expressed concerns aboutthe small size of this specific population. Examples of qualitativefeedback that raised questions about the session's need included “I amnot sure how many kids with treated OSA have insomnia – rare in myclinics” (sleep expert), and “Applies only to a select sub-group of childrenwith OSA" (sleep expert). However, comments like these are probablyinformed by participants' experience working with OSA patients, whichmay not involve follow-up after intervention.In addition to the positive feedback, all groups provided con-structive, design-focused feedback that will inform future developmentof the session and improve the extent to which BNBD can be tailored forOSA. Although there were some conflicting opinions between parentsand sleep experts/HCPs, primary suggestions for improvement were tosimplify language, clarify more difficult concepts, provide accom-modations to increase accessibility (e.g., subtitles on videos), re-bal-ancing the ratio of visual and audio information to enhance usability,reducing information that might not be relevant for the current sampleor detract from usefulness and value of the information being pre-sented, and bolstering the session's credibility by explicitly giving cre-dentials of the developers. Although the suggestions pertaining to thesession's design and features (e.g., the balance of ration of audio andvisual components) echo those seen in previous evaluations of onlinebehavioural interventions (Mohr et al., 2013), it is difficult to have an apriori understanding of how to balance the components of an inter-vention to meet users' needs (Mohr et al., 2013). As such, the feedbackobtained from the current study is extremely valuable for furtherInternet Interventions 18 (2019) 100265development of the session as it will allow for a more nuanced, well-tailored approach to intervention design.Participants also highlighted a larger conceptual challenge with theOSA-tailored session in that they indicated that more information aboutthe nature of the relationship between OSA and insomnia could en-hance the usefulness of the session. Unfortunately, clarifying updatedresearch on the OSA-insomnia link is challenging as emerging researchhas shown a high comorbidity between OSA and insomnia, as well asthe persistence of insomnia symptoms after OSA treatment, but theexact mechanisms of these combined and residual sleep issues are stillnot fully understood (Al-Jawder and BaHammam, 2012). While mul-tiple mechanisms have been proposed (e.g., Luyster et al., 2010), fur-ther research is required to clarify these pre-existing theories. However,being aware of this issue and how it impacts end users' perception of thesession is useful as future development of the session could presenttheories and their potential treatment implications while clearly notingthat additional evidence is needed.Participants also cited technical issues as a consistent problem,which is a common issue with online intervention programs (e.g.,Donker et al., 2013). During the current study, more technical problemsthan would be typically experienced were likely present because thiswas the first use of the BNBD program on a new platform. While thesetechnical issues may have impeded optimal user engagement with thesession, feedback will be used to identify core areas where technicalpersonnel can invest further attention (e.g., lag during videos).Parental recruitment problems raised questions about the pre-valence of the target population. Our recruitment strategy originallyinvolved online and print advertising through medical clinics, sleeporganizations, and social media. While this approach was very suc-cessful in our other sleep intervention research, it resulted in zero up-take from parents for the current study. As such, flyers were maileddirectly to 500 potentially eligible families whose children had theirtonsils and/or adenoids removed for OSA. This form of targeted re-cruitment generated some interest, but still only led to a final sample ofsix parents (3.2% of the targeted group participated despite all meetinginitial eligibility criteria).There are several reasons why recruitment challenges and sleepexpert's concerns about the need for this program might have beenencountered: (1) Insomnia symptoms following surgery may not be asprominent as emerging research suggests, as adenotonsillectomy sig-nificantly increases children's sleep efficiency and time spent in deepersleep stages (Lee et al., 2016). (2) Insomnia symptoms are not noticedor are accepted by parents due to a relative improvement in symptomspost-surgery. Due to the symptomatic overlap between OSA and in-somnia, it may be easier for parents to identify general symptom im-provements rather than noticing the unique consequences of insomnia,similar to what has been seen in other instances of comorbidities (e.g.,anxiety disorders; Clark et al., 2017). (3) Given the common co-oc-currence of sleep problems and mental health problems or neurodeve-lopmental disorders, our eligibility criteria likely resulted in the ex-clusion of many children who could benefit from such a session(Corkum et al., 2014). (4) Finally, children with insomnia and OSAtypically have a long waiting period in pre-treatment phases of OSAmanagement and insomnia screening is not common for children whohave OSA (Byars et al., 2011), making insomnia less likely to be iden-tified as a presenting problem among children OSA.4.1. Strengths and limitationsA primary strength of the current study was the breadth of feedback.Although stakeholder groups did not always agree on aspects of thesession (e.g., preference for more videos from HCPs and sleep expertsbut preference for more written text from parents), observing varyingperspectives underscores the importance of garnering feedback from avariety of stakeholders and highlights the importance of conductingthe differingusability studiesto obtain an understanding of9M. Orr, et al.Internet Interventions 18 (2019) 100265perspectives of end users and content experts. Another strength of thecurrent study was the relatively robust sample size (despite significantrecruitment challenges). Research suggests that about 85% of uniquefeedback/problems inherent in usability studies can be detected withonly 5 participants (Virzi, 1992), suggesting that our sample of 43participants is sufficient for obtaining useful insights into the usabilityof the session.There were also several notable limitations to the current study.Firstly, given the conflicting information provided by emerging re-search, attempted recruitment, and study feedback, the true need forthis session in its current form is still difficult to determine. However,this is important to know prior to potentially investing resources andrecruiting new participants for an RCT. Additionally, sleep experts andHCPs endorsed a wide-range of clinical expertise and some mentionedthat they were only able to provide a rough estimate of their experienceworking with sleep disorders. As such, it is possible that any resultsdifferentiating sleep experts and HCPs may be ambiguous due to sig-nificant overlap in scope of practice, resulting in a more consistency inperspectives.4.2. Clinical implications and future research directionsWhile the results of this usability study are generally positive, thereremains some question as to the need for this intervention given sta-keholder feedback and recruitment challenges. Furthermore, the resultsfrom this study raise further questions about the prevalence and me-chanisms of insomnia in the context of OSA. Additionally, althoughtailored interventions may provide a nuanced approach to a presentingproblem, eHealth interventions like BNBD are already highly persona-lized and may not require additional tailoring to meet the needs of atarget population.Further research is needed to understand the degree to which in-somnia may be under-recognized in children with past or current OSAand the extent to which parents and HCPs are aware of behaviouralinsomnia in the context of OSA. These estimates will help to informfuture testing of behavioural insomnia interventions at various stages ofOSA management, providing crucial information about the effective-ness and appropriate timing of sleep treatments among children facingmultiple sleep disorders, such as whether the tailored session should beprovided to patients immediately after surgery, after post-surgeryfollow-up, or to any patients with OSA or insomnia who may find ithelpful. Future research should also aim to survey the degree to whichinsomnia is screened and treated among children with OSA, as pre-liminary research has suggested that OSA may overshadow behaviouralsleep problems in clinical practice. Finally, future research should aimto better elucidate the prevalence of comorbid OSA and insomnia inchildren, as well as the prevalence of residual insomnia after OSA hasbeen treated.4.3. ConclusionsInsomnia is common among children with OSA (Byars et al., 2011).Even after surgical treatment for OSA, it is estimated that > 50% oftreated children may continue to suffer from insomnia (Chervin et al.,2014), underscoring the importance of an accessible insomnia inter-vention that contextualizes ongoing sleep problems within the contextof past issues with OSA. Based on the results of this usability study ofthe OSA-tailored session, participant feedback generally suggested thatthe session would be valued and usable. Nonetheless, other feedbackcombined with parental recruitment difficulties created questions aboutthe wide spread applicability of this session.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2019.100265.Declarations of interest: If the Better Nights, Better Days for OSA in-tervention proves to be effective after further testing, we may movetowards commercialization.FundingThis work was supported by the Canadian Sleep and CircadianNetwork [grant number CDT-142656]; and the Nova Scotia HealthResearch Foundation [grant number PSO-REDI-2016-867]; andFondation Les Petits Trésors de l'Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies [grantnumber 9100425].Declaration of competing interest(cid:129) We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interestassociated with this publication and there has been no significantfinancial support for this work that could have influenced its out-come.(cid:129) We confirm that the manuscript has been read and approved by allnamed authors and that there are no other persons who satisfied thecriteria for authorship but are not listed.
