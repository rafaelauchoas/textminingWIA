Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184www.elsevier.com/locate/artintA spectrum of compromise aggregation operators for multi-attributedecision makingXudong Luo ∗, Nicholas R. JenningsSchool of Electronics and Computer Science, The University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, United KingdomReceived 4 May 2006; received in revised form 8 November 2006; accepted 10 November 2006AbstractIn many decision making problems, a number of independent attributes or criteria are often used to individually rate an alternativefrom an agent’s local perspective and then these individual ratings are combined to produce an overall assessment. Now, in caseswhere these individual ratings are not in complete agreement, the overall rating should be somewhere in between the extremes thathave been suggested. However, there are many possibilities for the aggregated value. Given this, this paper systematically exploresthe space of possible compromise operators for such multi-attribute decision making problems. Specifically, we axiomaticallyidentify the complete spectrum of such operators in terms of the properties they should satisfy, and show the main ones that arewidely used—namely averaging operators, uninorms and nullnorms—represent only three of the nine types we identify. For eachtype, we then go onto analyse their properties and discuss how specific instances can actually be developed. Finally, to illustratethe richness of our framework, we show how a wide range of operators are needed to model the various attitudes that a user mayhave for aggregation in a given scenario (bidding in multi-attribute auctions).© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionDecision making is a central concern in the area of artificial intelligence and it is thus an essential component ofmany intelligent systems. For this reason, many decision making models have been developed (such as knowledge-based reasoning [5,47], case-based reasoning [37], neural networks [20], and constraint satisfaction techniques [44,48]). Now, in many cases, the decision making that is performed needs to consider multiple criteria or attributes. Insuch cases, the decision making agent is faced with a set of decision alternatives and the ratings per alternative percriterion (that indicate the degree of satisfaction of the criteria by the alternative) which then have to be fused togetherin order to produce an overall rating. This fusion process is carried out by some form of aggregation operation [9,60].In most cases, this operation is some form of weighted arithmetic mean [19]. Now, this works well in situations inwhich any differences are viewed as being in conflict because the operator reflects a form of compromise behaviouramong the various criteria. However, when these conditions do not hold, arithmetic mean is a poor choice. Thus, in* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: xl@ecs.soton.ac.uk (X. Luo), nrj@ecs.soton.ac.uk (N.R.

Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184general, the type of aggregation used should reflect the user’s individual choice of behaviour among criteria. Giventhis observation, we seek to develop a comprehensive set of possibilities for this task and to do so we turn to fuzzyset theory (see [17] for a view on the importance and impact of this line of research on the general area of artificialintelligence). Our motivation for this choice can be summarised by the following insight [3]:“In fuzzy set theory, membership functions of fuzzy sets play the role similar to utility functions—the role of de-grees of preference. Many authors, including Zadeh himself, refer to membership functions as ‘a kind of utilityfunctions’. The equivalence of utility and membership functions extends from semantical to syntactical level. Al-though this is not the only possible interpretation of membership functions, it allows one to formulate and solveproblems of multiple criteria decision making using the formalism of fuzzy set theory.”In more detail, in fuzzy set theory, the two most widely used aggregation operators are t-norms and t-conormsthat model “AND” and “OR” fuzzy connectives [14,23,32], respectively. However, their main limitation in terms ofaggregation is that the ensuing result is not a compromise between low and high ratings, which, in many cases, isa serious shortcoming [64,65]. To rectify this, alternative aggregation operators have been proposed as a means ofobtaining such a compromise (e.g., averaging operators [1,16,24,26,35], uninorm operators with a neutral element[52,62], and nullnorms (or t-operators) [8,50,51]). Furthermore, the general cases of the two extremes (minimum andmaximum) are t-norm and t-conorm and thus aggregation operators for obtaining a compromise between a pair oft-norms and t-conorms have also been developed (e.g., γ -operators [64], exponential compensatory operators [57],and convex-linear compensatory operators [39,57]). However, in all of this work, there is no common, systematicframework that enables the complete space of possibilities to be mapped out. This means that the sometimes subtledifferences between all these operators are not always readily apparent and that whole families of possibilities may bemissed out. This paper seek to rectify this shortcoming by systematically mapping out the space of possibilities.By way of illustration, consider the following applications of these operators in a variety of intelligent systems.Firstly, they have been employed in a number of agent-based systems. For example, in an agent-based automatednegotiation system that we have developed for business to consumer e-commerce, such an operator is employed toaggregate the satisfaction degree for a product and its purchasing conditions in order to decide whether or not it isacceptable [43]. In this case, when a customer does not like the product sufficiently much on its own, but the purchasingconditions (e.g., finance deal and delivery time) are very attractive, the aggregated acceptance degree for the goods issomewhere in-between the individual ratings, and thus the customer may decide to make the purchase if the overalldeal is sufficiently attractive. Similarly, in an agent-based meeting scheduling system, we use an operator to aggregateall the participating agents’ individual ratings for a possible common time slot into an overall rating for that slot [45].Thus, in this case, when some agents are inclined to reject a meeting time proposal and others are inclined to acceptit, the aggregated rating for the proposal is somewhere in-between their individual ratings. Secondly, aggregationoperators have been employed in expert systems. For example, in distributed expert systems, such operators have beenexploited to synthesise different expert systems’ uncertainties (ratings) for a particular conclusion [63]. Thus, when aconclusion is convincing for some expert systems, but not for others, the aggregated uncertainty for the conclusion isin-between the individual uncertainties. Similarly, in stand-alone rule-based systems, such operators have been usedto aggregate uncertainties (ratings) of the same proposition that are drawn in parallel from different sources [2,46,56]. Thus, when uncertainty from some sources do not support the proposition, but the ones from the others do, itsaggregated uncertainty is in-between the individual uncertainties. Finally, aggregation operators have been employedin many other decision making systems. For example, in fuzzy rule systems, such operators are used to aggregate theoutput of individual rules to obtain the overall system output [61]; in specific kinds of artificial neural networks whereuncertainty handling is necessary, they are used as a threshold function [56]; and in video query systems, they are usedto aggregate matching degrees of video attributes to a global matching degree [13].In each of the above cases, clearly the different applications provide a range of requirements that need differenttypes of aggregation. Moreover, the choice of a specific compromise operator in a specific situation is likely to varyfrom user to user because they each have their own view on how to do the aggregation. For example, when aggregatingtwo ratings, some users might be optimistic and believe the result should not be lower than either of the two; somemight be pessimistic and believe the result should not be higher than either of the two; and some might be more neutraland believe the result should be in-between. In addition, in some situations a user may want to set up a threshold sothat ratings higher than it are regarded as being positive and ratings lower than it as being negative, in which case theX. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184163situation becomes even more complex. In particular, even if we assume that the result of aggregating two conflictingratings (i.e., one higher than the threshold and one lower) is in-between the two, there are still a number of differentways (as discussed above) to aggregate two positive ratings or two negative ones.Such issues are important in a number of contexts. On the one hand, cognitive psychology has showed that thehuman brain is very efficient at processing bipolar (negative and positive) information [6,7,54]. It is believed that thisis so because of the way in which a large part of this expertise is acquired, and also likely to be a result of the cognitiveevolution of species. One the other hand, whenever we want decision making agents to act on behalf of users, the agentmust be capable of reflecting their individual nuances, preferences and attitudes to risk [10,40–42]. In both of thesecases, flexible aggregation is an integral component of this.Despite its importance, the issues associated with users’ attitudes in the aggregation of attributes’ ratings, distin-guished as positive and negative categories, have received comparatively little attention to date. In fact, in [4], thebipolar view is taken in modelling preferences. However, in our work it is used for modelling the scales of attributes’ratings. More importantly, the focus of [4] is modelling negative and positive preferences separately in the frameworkof possibility theory, and so such preferences are aggregated simply using fixed operators. This leaves the issue ofexploring the whole space of all possible operators undiscussed. At this point, it is similar for the other works ofbipolar preference representation, such as Cumulative Prospect theory [58], multi-criteria decision making [25], andArtificial Intelligence work that is oriented towards qualitative decision [36,59].Given this background, our aim in this paper is to impose greater structure on the problem by exploring all thepossible combinations of these attitudes in compromise aggregation. More precisely, we advance the state of the artby distilling a number of properties that are common to various types of compromise operators (including averagingoperators, uninorms and nullnorms) and also identifying several new types of compromise operators in order to modelthe various attitudes that users may have when aggregating non-conflicting ratings. We then go onto analyse theproperties of all aggregation outcomes and devise some construction methods that can be used to develop specificinstances of these operators for particular contexts. Finally, in order to illustrate that the richness of these operatorsis necessary in practice, we examine them in the context of a particular application of rating bids in multi-attributeauctions.The rest of the paper is organised as follows. By analysing two existing kinds of compromise operator and generalaggregation operators, Section 2 introduces the concept of general compromise operators. Section 3 further identifiesa number of new types of compromise operators and discusses how they reflect users’ attitudes to risk in aggregation.Sections 4–6 discuss the properties of the various operators and the methods for constructing them. Section 7 illustratesthe application of compromise operators in a multi-attribute auction scenario. The last section summarises our maincontributions and sheds light on future avenues of research.2. Generalised compromise operatorsThis section first analyses the fundamental concepts of two kinds of existing compromise operators [1,62] and ofgeneral aggregation operators [34]. Based on this analysis, we then introduce the concept of a general compromiseoperator that, in turn, induces several new types of compromise operator.2.1. AnalysisThe first type of existing compromise operators that we consider are uninorm compromise operators. These are aspecial case of uninorm operators [52,62]:Definition 1. A binary operator U : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a uninorm if:(1.1) monotonicity: ∀a1, a(cid:5)(1.2) associativity: ∀a1, a2, a3 ∈ [0, 1], U(U(a1, a2), a3) = U(a1, U(a2, a3));(1.3) commutativity: ∀a1, a2 ∈ [0, 1], U(a1, a2) = U(a2, a1); and(1.4) neutral element: ∃τ ∈ [0, 1], ∀a ∈ [0, 1], U(a, τ ) = a.∈ [0, 1], a1 (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, a2 (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, a2, a(cid:5)⇒ U(a1, a2) (cid:2) U(a(cid:5)221, a(cid:5)2);164X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184In particular, when the neutral element τ is 1, 0, and between 1 and 0, respectively, the uninorm operator is called at-norm (denoted as T), a t-conorm (denoted as S), and a uninorm compromise operator (denoted as Uτ ).Example 1. The following is a uninorm compromise operator [31]:U(P )τ(a1, a2) =(1 − τ )a1a2(1 − τ )a1a2 + τ (1 − a1)(1 − a2),where τ ∈ (0, 1) is its neutral element.The lemma below gives a property of uninorm compromise operators [62].Lemma 1.∀τ∀τ∀τ++1 , τ2−−1 , τ2−[0, τ ), τ∈ (τ, 1], Uτ (τ∈ [0, τ ), Uτ (τ+ ∈ (τ, 1],+1 , τ−1 , ττ+2 ) (cid:3) max{τ−2 ) (cid:2) min{τ− (cid:2) Uτ (τ, τ−+1 , τ−1 , τ++},2−},2+) (cid:2) τ.Proof. According to the monotonicity and neutral element property of uninorm operators, ∀τ−1 , ττ−(cid:2)+1 , τ+1 , τ−1 , τ−1 , τ2 , τ − ∈ [0, τ ), we have:Uτ (τUτ (τ+++2 ) (cid:3) Uτ (τ1 , τ ) = τ1+++2 ) (cid:3) Uτ (τ, τ2 ) = τ2−−−1 , τ ) = τ2 ) (cid:2) Uτ (τUτ (τ1−−−2 ) = τ2 ) (cid:2) Uτ (τ, τUτ (τ2Uτ (τ −, τ +) (cid:3) Uτ (τ −, τ ) = τ −Uτ (τ −, τ +) (cid:2) Uτ (τ, τ +) = τ +⇒ Uτ (τ+1 , τ+2 ) (cid:3) max{τ+1 , τ+2};⇒ Uτ (τ−1 , τ−2 ) (cid:2) min{τ−1 , τ−2};(cid:2)(cid:2)⇒ τ− (cid:2) Uτ (τ−+) (cid:2) τ+., τ(cid:2)(1)(2)(3)(4)+1 , τ+2 , τ + ∈ (τ, 1],According to this lemma, we can regard the neutral element of a uninorm compromise operator as a threshold: if arating is greater than the threshold it is regarded as positive, otherwise it is regarded as negative. Thus, in Lemma 1,property (2) reflects the intuition that when two ratings are both positive, they enhance the effect of each other in aggre-gation; property (3) that when two ratings are both negative, they weaken each other in aggregation; and property (4)that when two ratings are in conflict, a compromise result of aggregation is obtained.Another important property of uninorm operators that will be used later is:Lemma 2.(1) Monotonicity: ∀a1, a(cid:5)a1 (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, . . . , an (cid:2) a1, . . . , an, a(cid:5)n∈ [0, 1],(cid:5)n⇒ Uτ (a1, . . . , an) (cid:2) Uτ (a(cid:5)1, . . . , a(cid:5)n);(2) Symmetry: ∀a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, 1],{p1, . . . , pn} = {1, . . . , n} ⇒ Uτ (a1, . . . , an) = Uτ (ap1 , . . . , apn ).(5)(6)Property (5) in the above lemma means that operator Uτ is monotonically non-decreasing, and property (6) that theresult of aggregation using the operator is independent of the order of aggregation (i.e., it is symmetric). For example,we have:Example 2. From the uninorm (1) we can derive the following symmetric formula:U(P )τ(a1, . . . , an) =1 +(cid:3)τ1−τ1(cid:4)n−1 (cid:5).ni=11−aiai(7)X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184165A number of important properties of t-norms and t-conorms, which will be used later, are as follows:Lemma 3. ∀a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, 1],T(a1, . . . , an) (cid:2) min{a1, . . . , an} (cid:2) max{a1, . . . , an} (cid:2) S(a1, . . . , an);T(0, . . . , 0) = 0;S(1, . . . , 1) = 1.(8)(9)(10)The second type of existing compromise operators that we consider are averaging operators, these are defined infollowing way [1]:Definition 2. A mapping M :(cid:6)n∈N[0, 1]n → [0, 1] is an averaging operator if:(2.1) idempotency: ∀a ∈ [0, 1], M(a, . . . , a) = a;(2.2) monotonicity: ∀a1, a(cid:5)1, . . . , a(cid:5)(2.3) symmetry: ∀a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, 1], {p1, . . . , pn} = {1, . . . , n} ⇒ M(a1, . . . , an) = M(ap1 , . . . , apn).⇒ M(a1, . . . , an) (cid:2) M(a(cid:5)∈ [0, 1], a1 (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, . . . , an (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, . . . , an, a(cid:5)nnn); andExample 3. The arithmetical mean is a typical averaging operator:MA(a1, . . . , an) = a1 + · · · + ann.The lemma below gives an important property of averaging operators.Lemma 4. ∀a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, 1],min{a1, . . . , an} (cid:2) M(a1, . . . , an) (cid:2) max{a1, . . . , an}.(11)(12)This lemma means that any two different ratings are always regarded as being in conflict and so it is always thecase that a compromise result is obtained by an averaging operator M. Comparing Lemma 4 with Lemma 1, we cansee that for a compromise aggregation operator, property (4) is essential, but properties (2) and (3) could be relaxedand replaced by others (at least in an averaging operator M they can be replaced by min{a1, a2} (cid:2) M(a1, a2) (cid:2)max{a1, a2}). Accordingly, we can generalise the concept of a compromise operator such that it can cover uninormcompromise operators and averaging operators (or so called averaging compromise operators) as its special cases.That is, generalised compromise operators are those that exhibit properties (4) and (12) (but not necessarily (2) and(3)). Then, furthermore, since the generalised compromise operators are aggregation operators, they should satisfy theproperties of general aggregation operators [34]:Definition 3. A mapping A :(cid:6)n∈N[0, 1]n → [0, 1] is a general aggregation operator if:(3.1) boundary conditions: A(0, . . . , 0) = 0 and A(1, . . . , 1) = 1;(3.2) monotonicity: ∀a1, a(cid:5)1, . . . , a(cid:5)1, . . . , an, a(cid:5)(3.3) symmetry: ∀a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, 1], {p1, . . . , pn} = {1, . . . , n} ⇒ A(a1, . . . , an) = A(ap1 , . . . , apn).⇒ A(a1, . . . , an) (cid:2) A(a(cid:5)∈ [0, 1], a1 (cid:2) a(cid:5)1, . . . , an (cid:2) a(cid:5)nnn);Clearly, uninorm compromise operators and averaging operators are special cases of the general aggregation oper-ator. Of course, t-norms and t-conorms are also special cases since they are special cases of a uninorm.Based on the above analysis, the next subsection will introduce our concept of generalised compromise operators.2.2. Generalised compromise operatorsBefore giving the formal definition of general compromise operators, we first outline the intuitions we want theconcept to model. From the above description of uninorm compromise and averaging operators, we can see twocommon points. First, when there are conflicting ratings for an alternative, the overall rating corresponds to some166X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184form of trade-off between the best and the worst of the individual ratings. Second, all compromise operators shouldsatisfy the properties of general aggregation operators. Based on these two points, we define the concept of a generalcompromise operator as follows:Definition 4. A general aggregation operator is a general compromise operator, denoted as Cτ , with respect to τ ∈(0, 1) if ∀τ∈ (τ, 1] (k, l (cid:3) 1, k + l = n),−k−1 , . . . , τ−1 , . . . , τ++∈ [0, τ ), τ1 , . . . , τl−−−k , τ1 , . . . , τk} (cid:2) Cτ (τmin{τ+1 , . . . , τA general compromise operator Cτ is uninorm-like1 if ∀τ−+l , τ1 , . . . , τ+k ) = Cτ (τ−1 , . . . , τCτ (τ−1 , . . . , τotherwise it is averaging-like.2−l , τ, τ}.+l ) (cid:2) max{τ−1 , . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τ−l+l∈ [0, τ ), τ+k );+1 , . . . , τ+k∈ (τ, 1] (k, l (cid:3) 1, k + l = n),(13)In the above definition, (13) reflects properties (4) and (12).3 Moreover, in the following section, we will see clearlythat for general compromise operators, properties (2) and (3) can be replaced by other properties (in order to reflectthe decision makers’ attitudes to risk in aggregating non-conflicting ratings). In addition, from the proof of Lemma 1,we can see that the neutral element of a uninorm plays a key role in ensuring it satisfies (13). However, it can berelaxed a little and (13) can still be satisfied. Formally, we have:n∈N[0, 1]n → [0, 1] is a general compromise operator with respect(cid:6)∈ (τ, 1],∈ [0, τ ), τTheorem 1. A general aggregation operator Aτ :++to τ ∈ (0, 1) if ∀τ1 , . . . , τl−+−1 , · · · , τ1 , . . . , τk , τ−−},1 , . . . , τk++}.1 , . . . , τl−−1 , . . . , τk−k , τ ) (cid:2) Aτ (τ−k , τ ) (cid:3) min{τ+l , τ ) (cid:2) max{τ−1 , . . . , τ−1 , . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τAτ (τAτ (τAτ (τ+l ) (cid:2) Aτ (τ+1 , . . . , τ+l , τ ),Proof. Clearly, from (14)–(16) we can derive (13). (cid:2)In the above theorem, let l = 1 and k = 1 then (15) and (16) become:Aτ (τAτ (τ−1 , τ ) (cid:3) τ+1 , τ ) (cid:2) τ−1 ,+1 .(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)Thus, the above two can be seen to be a generalisation of the concept of a neutral element of a uninorm (and if we letτ = 1 or 0 in (17) and (18), we can get the corresponding generalisations of t-norms and t-conorms).4Now, we turn to the issue of confirming that our general compromise operators can cover the existing compromiseoperators: uninorms compromise operators, averaging operators and nullnorms. First, we have the following obvioustheorem:Theorem 2. Uninorm compromise operators and averaging operators are special cases of general compromise oper-ators.1 That is, like a uninorm operator, it has a unit element τ .2 That is, like an averaging operator, it has no any unit element.3 However, we cannot replace the boundary condition of general aggregation operators by:(cid:7)Cτ (a1, . . . , an) =0 if 0 ∈ {ai | ai (cid:2) τ, i = 1, . . . , n},1 if 1 ∈ {ai | ai (cid:3) τ, i = 1, . . . , n}.This is because not all types of compromise operators satisfy the replacement. For example, the arithmetical mean (see Example 3) and nullnorm(see axiom (5.4) and Theorem 3) do not satisfy it.4 The generalisation of uninorms is not on the main line of this paper and so we will not discuss it further here.X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184167Second, our concept of a general compromise operator can also cover nullnorms (or t-operators) [8,50,51] whichare defined as follows:Definition 5. A binary operator V : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a nullnorm if:21, a2, a(cid:5)∈ [0, 1], a1 (cid:2) a(cid:5)(5.1) monotonicity: ∀a1, a(cid:5)(5.2) associativity: ∀a1, a2, a3 ∈ [0, 1], V(V(a1, a2), a3) = V(a1, V(a2, a3));(5.3) commutativity: ∀a1, a2 ∈ [0, 1], V(a1, a2) = V(a2, a1); and(5.4) annihilator element: ∃τ ∈ [0, 1],∀a ∈ [τ, 1], V(1, a) = a,∀a ∈ [0, τ ], V(0, a) = a.1, a2 (cid:2) a(cid:5)2⇒ V(a1, a2) (cid:2) V(a(cid:5)1, a(cid:5)2);Theorem 3. Nullnorm is a special case of a general compromise operator.(19)(20)−−1 , τProof. Clearly, a nullnorm V can satisfy axioms (3.1)–(3.3) of a general aggregation operator. In the following, weshow that it can also satisfy (13).

By Lemma 1, uninorm compromise operators correspond to the case of ([0, l−], [u+, 1]); by Lemma 4,averaging operators correspond to the case of ([l−, u−], [l+, u+]); and by Theorem 3, nullnorms correspond to thecase of ([u−, τ ], [τ, l+]).

Conceptions of various risk-based compromise operatorsThis section formally defines the various types of compromise operators we identified in the previous section. Inparticular, we discuss them in terms of how they reflect the users’ attitudes to risk in aggregation. We focus on riskhere because it provides a well understood framework for characterising the types of nuance that are crucial to theflexible decision making we aim to capture [12,28,29]. In particular, we make the standard assumption that userscan exhibit three broad types of attitude toward risk [53]: risk-seeking (optimistic), risk-averse (pessimistic) or risk-neutral (neutral). In a specific application, users can choose a particular compromise aggregation operator accordingto the combination of these basic attitudes. That is, in the risk-seeking case the aggregated result is not smaller thanthe biggest rating, in the risk-averse case it is not bigger than the smallest rating, and in the risk-neutral case it isin-between the biggest and the smallest ratings. Formally, we have:Definition 6.

A general compromise operator is optimistic, denoted as C(o)τoptimistic., if it is τ -low-optimistic and τ -high-X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184169Suppose an auctioneer agent needs to aggregate a number of ratings (with respect to several attributes) to producean overall rating for a bid. If it has a risking-seeking attitude in aggregating all its positive or all its negative ratings,an optimistic operator should be chosen. Thus, using such an operator to aggregate two positive ratings (for example0.7 and 0.8) will produce an even more positive overall rating (for example 0.89), and using it to aggregate twonegative ratings (for example 0.3 and 0.4) will produce a less negative overall rating (for example 0.47). Such anoperator should be used if the decision maker does not fear over-rating an alternative when the individual ratings areall positive or all negative.Definition 8. A general compromise operator is pessimistic, denoted as C(p)pessimistic.τ, if it is τ -low-pessimistic and τ -high-If the auctioneer has a risking-averse attitude in aggregating all its positive or all its negative ratings, a pessimisticoperator should be used. Using such an operator to aggregate two positive ratings (for example 0.7 and 0.8) willproduce a less positive overall rating (for example 0.65), and using it to aggregate two negative ratings (for example 0.3and 0.4) will produce an even more negative overall rating (for example 0.27). Such an operator should be used if thedecision maker fears over-rating an alternative when the individual ratings are all positive or all negative.Definition 9. A general compromise operator is optimistic-pessimistic, denoted as C(o-p)and τ -high-pessimistic.τ, if it is τ -low-optimisticSometimes an auctioneer’s risk attitude could differ depending on the decision being made. For example, whenthe two attributes’ ratings are both positive, it might be risk-averse since it fears over-rating the bid if, for example,it is not sure the bider can really deliver such an offer. However, when the two attributes’ ratings are both negative,it could be more risk-seeking since both rating are bad and so it would not rate it as being good even if it could givean overall rating higher than that of the individual ones. In other words, whatever the auctioneer did, it would notmake a big mistake, but its optimistic rating might encourage the bider to continue bidding. In this case, an optimistic-pessimistic operator should be chosen. Thus, using such an operator to aggregate two positive ratings (for example 0.7and 0.8) will produce a less positive overall rating (for example 0.65), and using it to aggregate two negative ratings(for example 0.3 and 0.4) will produce a less negative overall rating (for example 0.47).Note that according to (21), (22) and Theorem 3, nullnorms are actually a kind of optimistic-pessimistic compro-mise operator. Moreover, in some special cases, the threshold element τ is also the annihilator (see Definition 5).Another interesting point is that from Lemma 1, we can see that these are exactly opposite to the case of uninormcompromise operators: in aggregating positive ratings decision makers are risk-seeking (optimistic), but in aggregat-ing negative ratings they are risk-averse (pessimistic). So, in this sense, the uninorm compromise operator is a type ofpessimistic-optimistic compromise operator:Definition 10. A general compromise operator is pessimistic-optimistic, denoted as C(p-o)and τ -high-optimistic.τ, if it is τ -low-pessimisticIf an auctioneer’s risk attitude varies from risk-averse in aggregating negative ratings, to risk-seeking in aggregatingpositive ratings, a pessimistic-optimistic operator should be chosen. Thus, using such an operator to aggregate twopositive ratings (for example 0.7 and 0.8) will produce an even more positive overall rating (for example 0.85), andusing it to aggregate two negative ratings (for example 0.3 and 0.4) will produce an even more negative overall rating(for example 0.27). Such an operator should be used if the decision maker’s attitude is influenced by the number ofgood or bad ratings received. Specifically, when all the attributes’ ratings are positive, it can model the phenomenonthat the more of these there are, the more positive the agent becomes in its aggregating. Similarly, when all the ratingsare negative, it can model the phenomenon that the more of these there are, the more negative the agent becomes.Definition 11. For a general compromise operator, it is optimistic-neutral, denoted as C(o-n)and τ -high-neutral; it is pessimistic-neutral, denoted as C(p-n), if it is τ -low-optimistic, if it is τ -low-pessimistic and τ -high-neutral; it isττ170X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184neutral-optimistic, denoted as C(n-o)C(n-p)ττ, if it is τ -low-neutral and τ -high-pessimistic., if it is τ -low-neutral and τ -high-optimistic; it is neutral-pessimistic, denoted asHere we only explain the first type of operator and others can be understood similarly. If an auctioneer’s risk attitudevaries from risk-seeking in aggregating negative ratings, to risk-neutral in aggregating positive ratings, an optimistic-neutral operator should be chosen. Thus, using such an operator to aggregate two positive ratings (for example 0.7and 0.8) will produce a tradeoff overall rating (for example 0.75), and using it to aggregate two negative ratings(for example 0.3 and 0.4) will produce a less negative overall rating (for example 0.47). Such an operator should beused if the decision maker wishes to encourage lower rated bids, while being more cautious with higher value ones.For example, if all the attributes’ ratings are negative, the auctioneer agent might offer encouraging feedback on theaggregation in order to try and elicit better subsequent bids. Whereas, when all the attributes’ ratings are positive,the auctioneer agent might want to give a more neutral feedback so that the bidder is encouraged to make a morefavourable bid that increases its overall rating.When taken together, these different compromise operators offer a rich set of possible ways (as shown in Table 1in Section 7) in which individual ratings for a given alternative are combined to give an overall rating. This richness isimportant because different people have different attitudes toward risk [55] and if we want agents to fully act on theirbehalf then they must be capable of reflecting their individual nuances, preferences and attitudes to risk (see Section7 for a more detailed example).4. Properties of compromise operatorsHaving outlined the spectrum of possible compromise operators, we now consider their various properties.Firstly, we define the concepts of τ -low and τ -high neutral elements as follows.Definition 12. For a general compromise operator Cτ ,(1) e ∈ [0, 1] is said to be a τ -low neutral element if ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, τCτ (τ−i+1, . . . , τ(2) e ∈ [0, 1] is said to be a τ -high neutral element if ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, τ−n ) = Cτ (τ−1 , . . . , τ−1 , . . . , τ−i−1, e, τ−i−1, τCτ (τ+1 , . . . , τ+i−1, e, τ+i+1, . . . , τ+n ) = Cτ (τ+1 , . . . , τ+i−1, τ−1 , . . . , τ−−n );i+1, . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τ+n ).+i+1, . . . , τ−i−1, τ−i+1, . . . , τ −n∈ [0, τ ],+i−1, τ+i+1, . . . , τ +n∈ [τ, 1],(30)(31)Then in the following theorem we give the properties (with respect to the above two concepts) that lead a generalcompromise operator to become a specific type of compromise operator.Theorem 4. For a general compromise operator Cτ ,(1) it is τ -high-optimistic if τ is its τ -high neutral element and ∀τ+1 , . . . , τ +nCτ (τ+1 , . . . , τ++n ) (cid:3) Cτ (τi+1, . . . , τ(2) it is τ -high-pessimistic if 1 is its τ -high neutral element;(3) it is τ -low-optimistic if 0 is its τ -low neutral element; and(4) it is τ -low-pessimistic if τ is its τ -low neutral element and ∀τ+1 , . . . , τ+i−1, τ, τ+n );Cτ (τ−1 , . . . , τ−n ) (cid:2) Cτ (τ−1 , . . . , τ−i−1, τ, τ−i+1, . . . , τ−n ).Proof. In the following, we check them one by one:−1 , . . . , τ −n∈ (τ, 1],∈ [0, τ ),(32)(33)Cτ (τ⇒ Cτ (τ⇒ Cτ (τ+1 , . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τ+1 , . . . , τ+i+1, . . . , τ+i−1, τ, τ+n ) (cid:3) Cτ (τ, . . . , τ, τ++n ) (cid:3) max{τ1 , . . . , τ+n ) = Cτ (τ++1 , . . . , τi−1, τ++j , τ, . . . , τ ) = τj+n};+i+1, . . . , τ+n )X.

If τ ∈ (0, 1) is both the τ -low and τ -high neutral elements of a general compromise operator Cτ , thenthe operator is a uninorm.This corollary means that the concept of neutral elements (see Definition 1) is a special case of τ -low and τ -highneutral elements.Corollary 2. For a general compromise operator Cτ , if 0 is its τ -low neutral element and 1 is its τ -high neutralelement, then the operator is a nullnorm.This corollary means that the concepts of τ -low and τ -high neutral elements can not only cover the concept ofneutral element, but also others. So, they are actually a kind of generalisation of neutral elements.5. The construction of compromise operatorsThe previous two sections discussed the general concepts and properties of various compromise operators. Buildingon this, this section discusses the issue of how such operators can actually be constructed. More specifically, we give anumber of ways to construct these operators from the existing t-norms, t-conorms and various compromise operators(and, actually, also reveal the relation of various compromise operators with these existing operators). We considerconstructing these operators in this way because the standard principles of software and knowledge engineering haveshown the benefits of reusing existing functions and operators to construct something new, rather than building fromscratch.The methods discussed in this section are of three broad kinds: the transfer-then-reverse method (Section 5.1), theadditive generating function method (Section 5.2), and the ordinal sum method (Section 5.3). The idea behind thefirst method, which is widely used for constructing various aggregation operators, is to construct the new operatorsfrom existing operators basically by transferring functions and their reverse [9]. In the relevant literature, the secondand third methods are, respectively, used: (i) to construct t-norms, t-conorms and uninorms from the ordinary sumoperator (+) by means of so-called “additive generating functions” [21,22,38], and (ii) to construct new t-normsand t-conorms by setting the new operators as the ordinal sum of the existing operators [11,30,33]. In Sections 5.2and 5.3, we discuss how the ideas behind these two methods can also be used to construct various compromiseoperators.5.1. The transfer-then-reverse methodIn this subsection, Theorems 5–7 give several ways to construct the components of various compromise operatorsthat are used to aggregate all negative or all positive ratings; and Theorem 8 gives a way of dealing with conflicting172X. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184ratings. So, a specific compromise aggregation operator can be made of three components that are provided by thesetheorems, which will be illustrated at the end of this subsection.First, we give the method that transfers existing t-norms and t-conorms to the compromise operator components ofaggregating all negative or all positive ratings.The properties of the transfer functions are listed in the following definition:Definition 13. For a given τ ∈ [0, 1],(1) a non-decreasing 1–1 mapping h : [0, τ ] → [0, 1] is a τ −-constructor if h(0) = 0 and h(τ ) = 1; and(2) a non-decreasing 1–1 mapping h : [τ, 1] → [0, 1] is a τ +-constructor if h(τ ) = 0 and h(1) = 1.The method of transferring t-norms and t-conorms is given in the following theorem:Theorem 5. For a general compromise operator Cτ ,(1) it is τ -high-optimistic if ∀τCτ (τ+1 , . . . , τwhere h is a τ +-constructor;−+n ) = h(2) it is τ -low-optimistic if ∀τ+1 , . . . , τ +(cid:3)−1S(h(τn∈ (τ, 1],+1 ), . . . , h(τ1 , . . . , τ −(cid:3)−1S(h(τn∈ [0, τ ),−1 ), . . . , h(τCτ (τ−1 , . . . , τwhere h is a τ −-constructor;+(3) it is τ -high-pessimistic if ∀τ−n ) = h1 , . . . , τ +(cid:3)(cid:3)+−1T1 , . . . , τh(τwhere h is a τ +-constructor; and+n ) = hCτ (τn(4) it is τ -low-pessimistic if ∀τ∈ (τ, 1],+1 ), . . . , h(τ−1 , . . . , τ −(cid:3)(cid:3)−1Th(τn∈ [0, τ ),−1 ), . . . , h(τCτ (τ−1 , . . . , τwhere h is a τ −-constructor.−n ) = h(cid:4)+n )),(cid:4)−n )),(cid:4)(cid:4),+n )(cid:4)(cid:4),−n )(34)(35)(36)(37)Proof. Here we only show the case of the τ -high-optimistic operator since the others can be derived in a similarmanner.(cid:4)+n )S⇒ h(cid:3)+h(τ1 ), . . . , h(τ(cid:3)(cid:3)+−1Sh(τ1 ), . . . , h(τ(cid:9)(cid:8)++(cid:3) maxn )1 ), . . . , h(τh(τ(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)++−1+(cid:3) hh(τn )1 ), . . . , h(τn )max(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:4)+−1−1= maxhh(τ, . . . , h1 )++= max{τ}.1 , . . . , τnSo, by Definition 6, item 1 of the theorem holds. (cid:2)(cid:3)h(τ(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:9)+n )To illustrate the above method, we give the following example:Example 4. Some examples of t-norms and t-conorms are listed as below.(1) Idempotent operators:TI (a1, . . . , an) = min{a1, . . . , an},SI (a1, . . . , an) = max{a1, . . . , an}.(38)(39)X. Luo, N.R.

Luo, N.R.

For a given τ ∈ [0, 1],(1) a non-decreasing 1–1 mapping h : [0, τ ] → [0, τ ] is a τ −-generator if h(0) = 0 and h(τ ) = τ ; and(2) a non-decreasing 1–1 mapping h : [τ, 1] → [τ, 1] is a τ +-generator if h(τ ) = τ and h(1) = 1.Theorem 7.

The additive generating function methodIn the relevant literature, the method is mainly used to construct t-norms, t-conorms and uninorms from the ordinarysum operator (+) by means of so-called “additive generating functions” [21,22,38]. Actually, the idea behind themethod can also be used to construct various operators. In fact, by Theorems 5, 6 and 8, we can also construct varioustypes of compromise operators in this way (i.e., using “additive generating functions” to construct t-norms, t-conormsand uninorms first and then using them further to construct various compromise operators). Moreover, we can directlyconstruct various compromise operators in this way as follows:Theorem 9. Let g1 be a mapping from [0, τ ] to (−∞, 0], g2 be a mapping from [τ, 1] to [0, +∞), and g3 a mappingfrom [0, 1] to (−∞, +∞). Then for a particular mapping C+τ :−11 (g1(a1) + · · · + g1(an))−12 (g2(a1) + · · · + g2(an))−13 (g3(a1) + · · · + g3(an))if a1, . . . , an ∈ [0, τ ],if a1, . . . , an ∈ (τ, 1],otherwise,n∈N[0, 1]n → [0, 1] that is defined as:τ (a1, . . . , an) =C+⎧⎪⎨(64)⎪⎩(cid:6)gggif g3 is strictly increasing, bijective, and has g3(τ ) = 0, it is a compromise operator; and further:(1) it is τ -high-optimistic if g2 is strictly increasing, continuous and g2(τ ) = 0 and g2(1) = +∞;(2) it is τ -low-optimistic if g1 is strictly decreasing, continuous and g1(0) = 0;(3) it is τ -high-pessimistic if g2 is strictly decreasing, continuous and g2(1) = 0; and(4) it is τ -low-pessimistic if g1 is strictly increasing, continuous and g1(τ ) = 0 and g1(0) = −∞.Proof.

The ordinal sum methodIn the relevant literature, this method is mainly used to construct t-norms and t-conorms by setting the new oper-ators as the ordinal sum of the existing ones [11,30,33]. Actually, the idea behind this method can also be used forconstructing various types of compromise operators from existing ones. In fact, by Theorem 5, we can obtain t-normsand t-conorms from existing compromise operators, then the ordinal sum of these compromise operator based t-normsand t-conorms can constitute new t-norms and t-conorms, and finally by Theorem 5, we can obtain new compromiseoperators from the ordinal sum t-norms and t-conorms.56. The construction of uninorm compromise operatorsFrom the above section, we can see that uninorm compromise operators play an important role in constructing var-ious compromise operators. This means if we have more uninorm operators we can have more compromise operators.Given this, this section explores the issue of constructing uninorms and gives a specific method for so doing.Firstly, we need the following lemma that is a basic fact in modern algebra [49].Lemma 5. Let (◦, X) and ((cid:11), Y ) be two algebraic structures. Ify1 (cid:11) y2 = f−1(cid:3)(cid:4)f (y1) ◦ f (y2),where mapping f : X → Y is a 1–1 and increasing, and operator ◦ is increasing, associative and commutative, thenoperator (cid:11) is increasing, associative and commutative.Before delving into the method, we need a sort of generating function concept:Definition 16. For a given τ ∈ (0, 1), a 1–1 non-decreasing function hτ : [−1, 1] → [0, 1] is a [−1, 1]-generator ifhτ (−1) = 0, hτ (0) = τ and hτ (1) = 1.Now we can detail our method:Theorem 10. The following is a uninorm compromise operator with a neutral element of 0.5:(h(2a1 − 1), h(2a2 − 1))) + 1τ2,U0.5(a1, a2) = h−1(U(P )where h is a [−1, 1]-generator.Proof. Let g(x) = 2x − 1, and thus g−1(x) = x+1we can rewrite (65) asU0.5(a1, a2) = ff (a1), f (a2)(cid:3)U(P )τ(cid:4)(cid:4).−1(cid:3)2 . And let f (x) = h(g(x)), and thus f −1(x) = g−1(h−1(x)). ThenSo, by Lemma 5 and (1) that defines U(P )prove that U0.5 is a uninorm, by Definition 1, we need to further check that:τ, commutativity, associativity and monotonicity hold for U0.5. In order to5 It is straightforward to work out the details and so we do not specify them here for the sake of space.(65)(66)178X. Luo, N.R.

Multi-attribute bid rating aggregation scenarioIn order to show that the richness of our framework is necessary in practice, this section examines the use of thevarious operators that we have devised in a multi-attribute auction setting [12,28,29]. We chose this particular scenariobecause auctions are a central issue in the area of agent-mediated electronic commerce and this represents an areawhere the ability to flexibly represent and combine preferences is very much to the fore [27]. Currently, however, mostof this work focuses on a single attribute (usually price), but in many settings, other attributes such as delivery dateand quality are also important. In such multi-attribute auctions, an auctioneer agent needs to obtain an overall ratingfor the bid from ratings of the individual attributes of the bid. In most cases, the aggregation operation that is used istypically some form of weighted arithmetic mean [19]. However, as argued earlier, this is not always a good choice.More specifically, we discuss the different risk attitude aggregations of individual attributes’ ratings for a givenbid.6 Now, suppose that an auctioneer agent gets bids b1, . . . , b7 rated on two attributes A1 and A2.7 Then it aggregates6 We will discuss the issue of weighted aggregations in a subsequent paper.7 The aggregation methods we propose are not in any way limited to combining information from just two attributes.

Here the first two columns are the auctioneer’s attitude to risk in aggregating all the negative or all thepositive ratings. The reasons why the specific types of compromise operators are employed and the plausible reasonsfor these choices have already been discussed in Section 3. From this, it can clearly be seen that as the auctioneer’s8 According to [18], the threshold can typically be chosen to be 0.5. In this context, it means that bid attributes with ratings higher than thethreshold are regarded as good and ones with ratings lower than the threshold are regarded as bad.182X. Luo, N.R.

This is because for a bidwith the same individual ratings, an operator reflecting a risk-seeking attitude comes out with a comparatively largeoverall rating; an operator reflecting a risk-averse attitude comes out with a comparatively small overall rating; and anoperator reflecting a risk-neutral attitude comes out somewhere in-between. Thus, if we just considered the operatorsthat have previously been developed, we are not able to capture this rich set of plausible alternatives.8. Conclusions and future workThe main aim of this paper is to provide a framework for identifying various types of compromise operators thatdecision making agents may adopt when aggregating opinions. To this end, we developed a systematic approach fordiscovering and analysing compromise operators and, in so doing, we make a number of contributions to the state ofthe art:• We define the concept of general compromise operators and, from this, identify several new types of compromiseoperators to reflect different potential users’ attitudes in aggregating ratings. Thus, some users might be optimisticand so their aggregating result should not be lower than the highest constituent one; some might be pessimisticand so their result should not be higher than the lowest one; and some might be neutral and thus their result shouldbe in-between the lowest and the highest ones. For these operators, a threshold is set up so that ratings higher thanit are positive and ratings lower than it are negative. The aggregation results of conflicting ratings (i.e., some arepositive and the others are negative) are in-between the lowest and highest ones, but the ways in which all positive(or all negative) ratings are aggregated can vary. Moreover, our settings cover all possibilities of this variation,whereas existing types of compromise operator cover an incomplete space of possibilities.• We introduce the concepts of τ -low and τ -high neutral elements and discuss properties of compromise operatorswith respect to them. These two concepts are the generalisation of the conventional notion of a neutral element.• To offer more freedom in the selection of suitable compromise operators for particular applications (since the bestchoice of operator is likely to vary from problem to problem), we discuss three kinds of methods to constructthem: (i) the transfer-then-reverse method, (ii) the additive function method, and (iii) the ordinal sum method. Inaddition, since uninorm compromise operators play an important role in these methods, we devise a new methodfor constructing them as well.• To show the richness of the various compromise operators we propose, we illustrate their use in a multi-attributeauction bid rating aggregation scenario. Here we see that the choice of operators has a significant effect on theoutcome of the auction and each possibility is a plausible view from some standpoint.There are a number of avenues of further work that follow from what we have presented in the paper. First, morework is needed to develop systematic methods for constructing the various compromise operators we identify. Second,the various specific compromise operators that we have developed need to be applied to a wider range of real-worldproblems, in order to more fully evaluate their usefulness and impact by comparing with other methods (for examplethe method of the belief function and possibility theories mentioned in [15]). Third, it is worth discussing how toX. Luo, N.R. Jennings / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 161–184183deal with the weighting issue in aggregations of various compromise operators proposed in this paper since in manysettings the different attributes vary in their degree of importance. Finally, as the focus of this work was on introducingnew aggregation operators, we have not discussed the continuity property of various compromise operators (in linewith other similar work [1,8,34,50–52,62]). However, we realise this is an important property for these operators andas such further work is needed on this aspect.AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their insightful comments that have significantlyimproved the quality of the paper.References[1] J.
