Przymusinski * Department of Computer Science, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA Received November 1996; revised May 1997 Abstract reasoning and different semantics fotmalizations In recent years, various logic programs have been proposed, including autoepistemic logic, for normal and disjunctive circumscription, CWA, GCWA, ECWA, epistemic specifications, stable, well-founded, stationary and static semantics of normal and disjunctive logic programs. of nonmonotonic In this paper we introduce a simple nonmonotonic knowledge representation framework which isomorphically contains all of the above-mentioned nonmonotonic formalisms and semantics as special cases and yet is significantly more expressive than each one of these formalisms considered individually. The new formalism, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Knowledge and Beliefs, AELB, is obtained by augmenting Moore’s autoepistemic logic, AEL, already employing the knowledge operator, C, with an additional belief operator, t?. As a result, we are able to reason not only about formulae F which are known to be true (i.e., those for which CF holds) but also about those which are only believed to be true (i.e., those for which !3F holds). The proposed logic constitutes a powerful new formalism which can serve as a unifyingfrume- work for several major nonmonotonic formalisms. It allows us to better understand mutual re- lationships existing between different formalisms and semantics and enables us to provide them with simpler and more natural definitions. It also naturally leads to new, even more expressive, flexible and modular formalizations and semantics. @ 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction expansion Moore’s autoepistemic logic, AEL [ 201, is obtained by augmenting logic with a modal operator L. The intended meaning of the modal atom LF classical proposi- tional in is “F is provable” or “F is logically derivable”. Thus a stable autoepistemic Moore’s modal operator L can be viewed as a “knowledge operator” which allows us to reason about formulae known to be true in some stable expansion.2 However, often times to be true we also that are only believed to be true, where what is need to reason about believed or not believed is determined by some specific nonmonotonicformalism. about statements which are known those statements to reasoning in addition For example, consider a scenario l You rent a movie a football game. if you believe in which: that you will neither go to a baseball game nor to l You do not buy tickets We could describe this scenario as follows: 3 to a game if you don’t know that you will go to watch it. &baseball A &football > rentmovie TLbaseball A TLfootball> dontbuy-tickets. Assuming that initially (circumscription), this is all you know and that your beliefs are based on minimal that you (i.e., both lbaseball and Ifootball hold in all minimal and you will not buy tickets because you don’t know that you will go to any you will likely rent a movie because you believe entailment will not go to watch any games models) of the games (i.e., neither baseball nor football is provable). Suppose now that you learn that you will either go to a baseball game or to a football game: baseball V football. In the new scenario you will no longer rent a movie (because Tbaseball A Ifootball no longer holds in all minimal models) but you will not buy any tickets either because (i.e., neither baseball nor you don’t know yet which game you are going football is provable). Finally, suppose learn that you in fact go to a baseball game: that you eventually to watch baseball. Clearly, you no longer believe in not buying tickets because you now know that you are going to watch a specific game (i.e., baseball is provable). Observe, that in the above example the roles played by the knowledge operators are quite different and one cannot be substituted we cannot the premise Bybaseball A B-football LTbaseball A Llfootball because that would result replace and belief by the other.

Pr~ymusinski/Art~cial Intelligence 95 (I 997) 115-154 We call a knowledge and belief theory T consistent if the theory Cn, (T) is consistent. Clearly, T is consistent if and only if T y+ 1. The following proposition will be frequently used in the sequel. Proposition 2.4. The following sentences and derivation rules are valid in the logic AELB for any formulae F and G of the language K,Q: (4) (5) (6) (7) U(FAG) = l?FABG t3F > -23lF t3( F v G) > 7%F v l&G F-G i3F = BG The first sentence of two formulae that a conjunction believed.

Intended meaning of knowledge and belief atoms The modal operator L of Moore’s Autoepistemic Logic, AEL, is usually referred to as a “belief operator” (which operator”. Indeed, fully determine [ 201. However, when restricted the semantics of AEL) in any stable autoepistemic to stable autoepistemic expansions it in fact plays the role of a “knowledge expansion T we have: TkLF iff Tj=F, for any formula F. In other words, LF holds in the expansion T if and only known” if F is logically derivable6 in T, or, more precisely, from T. (8) if “F is in addition As we argued in the Introduction, to reasoning about statements which are to be true in “stable” expansions of knowledge and belief theories, we also need that are only believed to be true, where what is believed formalism. Consequently, the condition is determined by some specific nonmonotonic the new modal “belief operator” t3 of AELB in a “stable” expansion T if F is nonmonotonically known to reason about those statements or not believed we want formula F is believed from T: to satisfy that a T kl3F if T k=,,,, E where k,,,, denotes a specific nonmonotonic inference relation.
