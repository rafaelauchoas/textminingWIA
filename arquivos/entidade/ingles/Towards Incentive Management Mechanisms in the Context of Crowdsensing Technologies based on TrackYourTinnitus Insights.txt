Forexample, patients were empowered to contribute in treatment processes with the help of mobile crowdsourcing and crowdsensingtechnologies. However, when using the latter technologies, one prominent challenge constitutes a continuous user engagement.Incentive management techniques can help to tackle this challenge by motivating users through rewards and recognition in exchangeof task completion. For this purpose, we aim at developing a conceptual framework that can be integrated with existing mHealthmobile crowdsourcing and crowdsensing platforms. The development of this framework is based on insights we obtained fromthe TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) mobile crowdsensing platform. TYT, in turn, pursues the goal to reveal insights to the moment-to-moment variability of patients suffering from tinnitus.

IntroductionWith the advent of digitization in the medical domain, many examples have shown that the collaboration betweendoctors and researchers from medicine and computer science is becoming more and more important. For example,the discovery of knowledge could be improved by applying technical approaches to medical questions [2]. Alongthe digitization trend, the goal to prevent factors that may negatively affect one’s health is increasingly pursued.4P Medicine (Predictive, Personalized, Preventive and Participatory), an initial idea in medicine and first coined by∗ Corresponding author.

Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–000systems biologist Lee Hood [13], draws an interesting picture of how crowdsourcing and crowdsensing technologiescan be a first point of contact for patients to give them initial thoughts on their medical condition and furthermoreshare a holistic view of the condition in the associated community. However, to get the best of these technologies,especially in the eHealth and mHealth domains, an interdisciplinary approach is crucially required. In this context,mobile crowdsensing techniques are particularly promising for new insights on chronic diseases.In the TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) project, we aim at revealing new insights on tinnitus [11, 8, 10]. The latter is achronic disorder that affects approximately 10% (42 million) of the total European Union population (425 million).Note that research on tinnitus is particularly challenging as it is a medical condition that is characterized by a largeheterogeneity of symptoms and patient profiles. As a consequence, governments within the EU have spent billions ofEuros in their respective health care systems [12].In the context of TYT, a remarkable aspect that can be observed is the heterogeneity of the participation of itsregistered users [9]. This participation, in turn, indicates the overall motivation of the users to utilize the platform.Since TYT – and also other mHealth crowdsensing platforms – pursue the goal to gather large amounts of data thatcan be evaluated to work on new medical insights, including new treatment methods, the motivation of users to providedata is a fundamental pillar. As still many TYT users only provide less data or leave the platform early after using itfor the first time, the question arises, how the overall user motivation can be increased. For this purpose, we developeda conceptual framework that deals with incentives to motivate patients in using the TYT platform more frequently.The framework as well as its core considerations are presented in this paper.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss background information that arerelevant in the context of this paper. Section 3 then discusses revealed aspects of TYT that might be starting pointsfor an incentive management for TYT in particular and similar platform in general, while Section 4 discusses possiblefurther actions based on these insights. In Section 5, related work is discussed and Section 6 concludes the paper witha summary and an outlook.2. Background InformationThis section briefly discusses the required background aspects on mobile crowdsensing, incentive management,and TrackYourTinnitus,2.1. Mobile CrowdsensingThe increased use of mobile devices and the Internet of Things have fostered the utilization of mobile crowdsens-ing (including mobile crowdsourcing) technologies to improve the public health care across the globe, especially inbiomedical and clinical sciences [5]. At the very core, Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCR) advocates a proper user involve-ment to solve real-world tasks through the use of mobile devices and crowd users. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS), inturn, encompasses the implicit and explicit collection of sensor data through the internal and external mobile devicesensors in order to accomplish sensor tasks in different domains and contexts. Thereby, the applied sensors are ableto record not only personal attributes like the GPS location, but also environmental information such as air pressure,temperature or noise level in relation to the surroundings of the respective device. In addition, while sensing data,questionnaires can be used to gather even more valuable data as users can subjectively evaluate the context or theirindividual situation.2.2. Incentive ManagementOne fundamental challenge in the landscape of MCR and MCS constitutes the consideration of user motivationmechanisms [3]. Another frequently identified challenge in this context deals with low data quality [3]. Following this,Incentive Management (IM) is a mechanism that offers benefits or rewards to the system participants that requiresthe achievement of specific goals or the completion of certain activities. Today, IM is increasingly used in variousindustries and research fields. Thereby, IM techniques focus on the concrete actions and methods to increase themotivation of the participants, either by offering rewards or recognition [15]. To give some examples, commercialapplications like Badoo, Duolingo, Facebook and so forth use IM techniques to keep their users motivated. Thereby,K. Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–0003higher user motivation normally leads to more accurate data, which increases the overall data quality. Interestingly,in research projects, IM mechanisms are less utilized compared to industry projects [7]. For this purpose, we pursuethe development of a conceptual framework for incentive management that deals with MCS in the context of e-health and m-health applications (cf. Fig. 1). The framework is based on existing insights and evaluations of theTrackYourTinnitus platform [11, 9]. In general, the methods that will be applied to realize the framework are: (a)theoretical models, (b) performance metrics, and (c) data evaluations. The use of theoretical models shall help tounderstand the strategic behavior of the participants, while performance metrics shall help to design and maintain arobust system. Finally, the data evaluations are focused on aspects that may reveal insights to increase the overall usermotivation to use a platform like TYT.Fig. 1. Conceptual Framework for Incentive Management2.3. TrackYourTinnitusThis section gives relevant background information on TYT. The TYT mobile crowdsensing platform aims atmeasuring fluctuations of tinnitus perception and tinnitus distress under real-life conditions during the patient’s day.In particular, mobile crowdsensing services shall enable researchers to gather data from huge numbers of users. Notethat this allows tracking the moment-to-moment fluctuation of the tinnitus. Furthermore, tracked data may be related toeveryday behavior as well as the daily routine of patients to systematically identify relationships between individualroutines and tinnitus fluctuations. Technically, the platform comprises a website for user registration, two mobileapplications (for iOS and Android), and a MySQL database as a central repository for the data collected, which canbe made available to the clinicians and researchers upon request.Currently, for all registered TYT users as well as TYT in general, no advertisements or marketing efforts were made.A first promising direction to deal with the motivation of TYT users is an in-depth analysis of the procedure usershave to accomplish. Thereby, the question arises whether the procedure is bothering for TYT users or not. Considertherefore Fig. 2, it depicts a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram [14] showing the journey a userhas to accomplish when using TYT. Note that all manual user tasks are marked with a user icon and the automatedscript tasks (i.e., mainly connection issues with the TYT backend) are marked with the page icon. When using TYTfor the first time, users have two general paths that can be chosen by them, either register/login through the website ordownload the application from the respective app store (iOS or Android). Following this, users must answer a first setof questionnaires (i.e., Registration Questionnaires), which contains 51 questions in total. The questionnaires help tounderstand the medical tinnitus history of users. However, users gets 3 options at this stage to continue their journey:(a) don’t answer, (b) partly answer or (c) entirely answer all Registration Questionnaires (RQ). When a user opts for4K. Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–000path a or b, the overall TYT user journey ends. To be more precise, only when users have either answered or skippedall 51 RQ, they can use the Assessment Questionnaire (AQ). The latter measures the subjective tinnitus of the usersbased on 8 questions [9] on a random and daily basis. Based on this initial TYT phase and the procedure as well asfacts shown in Fig. 2, the following aspects can be observed:• It might be the case that the overall journey to use TYT needs more explicit explanations. For example, a notethat after registering through the website, the next step should be to download the mobile app may be helpful.• It might be the case that the overall journey to use TYT has too much loose ends.• Currently, less motivation mechanisms are applied. The general motivation of users is based on the intrinsicmotivation to learn more about the individual tinnitus (cf. Fig. 2 1(cid:13)). To complete the RQ, a patient gets nomotivating factors (cf. Fig. 2 2(cid:13)). On the other hand, it is compelling to complete them. This might bother theusers. Finally, to fill out the daily AQ, the only applied motivating factor constitutes of receiving notifications(cf. Fig. 2 3(cid:13)).Fig. 2. TYT User Journey in Terms of a Business Process Model and Notation2.4. User Motivation in TrackYourTinnitusAccording to report from 2013 of the World Health Organization (W.H.O) [7], it was found that most of the eHealthapplications on the market were made from a commercial perspective rather than a research one. Moreover, it wasdiscovered that the industry had focused only on four of the eight most prevalent medical conditions. The report alsorevealed that the applications designed for assisting or monitoring the medical condition were used more frequentlythan the ones that were designed for simple informative purposes. Finally, it was also observed that the data visualiza-tion was mainly in a textual style and, hence, in most cases the user-interface was perceived as being counterintuitive[7]. Therefore, it is important to consider the target audience when designing the applications. For example, if most ofthe application users are elderly people, then it is less likely that they have a high-end smartphone and/or use featuresthat demand a sophisticated user interaction. When looking at TYT from the user journey perspective, we may observethat we need to address the current challenges similar to the ones found in W.H.O report [7]. Primarily, we need tomotivate TYT users at each stage of their application journey. This would help us to retain users that we lose at thefirst set of questionnaires i.e. RQ, as can be identified from the differences in the unique user numbers shown in Table2. The latter shows that the number of users that fill out the RQ is much higher than the number of users that fill out theAQ. Following this, the number of users we lose for the AQ probably leave the platform during/after accomplishingthe RQ and do not return. Moreover, we also might need to make the user interface more intuitive and easy to use forboth Android and iOS users.3. Data Analysis on TrackYourTinnitusK. Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–0005This section discusses aspects we revealed from TYT that might be valuable starting points for an incentive man-agement for TYT in particular and other platforms coping with the management of chronic diseases in general. Somebasic statistics from the TYT database are illustrated in Table 1. Currently (April 2018), we have a total of 2039 uniqueusers that either registered on the website or through the mobile apps. From these 2039 users, we have 25.60% users(522) that answered at least one of the 51 questions in the RQ set. Since these questions had no validation checks,it was possible that the users simply skipped the questions and moved onto the next one. We got 75.33% (1536) ofthe total users that used the AQ at least once to evaluate their subjective tinnitus [9]. Following this, we lost a totalof 24.67% users from the first RQ set to the AQ. Furthermore, we may also observe that the users gave preferenceto convenience over privacy by allowing the TYT app to remember their credentials. More specifically, 83.77% usersopted to remember their email address and 65.96% opted to remember their credentials for the next login.Table 1. Descriptive User Statistics based on Registration and Assessment QuestionnairesRegistration QuestionnaireAssessment QuestionnaireUnique UsersUnique CountriesRemember CredentialsSave Email203995134517081536849731282Another interest aspect concerning user motivation constitutes the distribution of given answers to the eight ques-tions of the AQ (cf. Fig. 3). Thereby, the x-axis represents the scale from 0 to 1 and y-axis represents the number oftimes users have answered the question. Interestingly, for Questions 2, 3, and 6, a similar pattern can be observed,which might be a valuable direction. For example, it might be the case that we can relieve users from answeringQuestion 3 and 6 if they have answered Question 2.Fig. 3. Distribution of User Data for Assessment Questionnaire6K. Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–000The next interesting aspect emerges when having a look at the used mobile operating systems and mobile devices(cf. Table 2). Note that the total number of device users are greater than the total number of unique users. This is dueto the fact that a user might have used multiple devices or updated the device software. In both cases, this scenariois regarded as a new device. Furthermore, the lost users column indicates the number of users that answered or wentthrough all the RQ, but never started answering the AQ. To be more precise, 41.11% of all users, of which 3.86% wereiOS and 30.14% Android users, got lost after or during the RQ. Moreover, the numbers also show that from the totaliOS users, 9.23% were lost, whereas from the total Android users, (alarming) 60.56% were lost.Table 2.

The latter are being the only incentive for the users at the moment to fill outthe AQ. Therefore, we analyzed both types of notifications that users can choose; i.e., standard notifications or customnotifications (cf. Table 3). Thereby, standard notifications are using a random approach, while custom notificationsare applied to fixed points in time. An in-depth description of these notifications can be found in [10]. Primarily, weobserve that even though unique devices for iOS is more than twice compared to Android, the ratio of standard andcustom notifications for Android users is much higher than that of iOS. This means that from the total of iOS usersthat selected any type of notification, a iOS user receives nearly 12 standard and 32 custom notifications, whereas anAndroid user from the total Android users receives 43 standard and 49 custom notifications. Although we have a totalof 1536 unique users, the total number of unique users in Table 3 shows that 1406 users own a total of 1532 devices.Following this, the 130 users that are getting lost here are the ones who never opted to receive any kind of notification.Finally, we briefly show the pearson’s correlations of the eight questions of the AQ (cf. Table 4). It is importantto note that even though 2 different scales are used (i.e., binary scale for Q1 and Q8 and visual analogue scale forQ2 to Q7 [9]), the data is normalized as the minimum and maximum values of both the scales are constant at 0 and1 respectively. Among the positive correlations, it can be observed that Q2 (Tinnitus Loudness) and Q3 (TinnitusDistress) have a high correlation of 0.76, whereas Q2 (Tinnitus Loudness) and Q6 (Stress) have a partial correlation of0.46. Moreover, we also observe an inverse relationship between Q4 (Mood) and Q6 (Stress), i.e, a negative correlationof 0.43. Some other interesting correlations are also revealed that may be analyzed in future work. Again, observedcorrelations may serve as a starting point to potentially relieve particular users from answering specific questions.4. DiscussionThe analyzed results lead to valuable insights. First, from Table 1 it can be observed that we lose a total of 24.64%users between the tasks to fill out the RQ and the AQ. It can be assumed that this is caused by the fact that no extrinsicmotivation is provided between these two tasks. As the procedure to answer 51 questions (i.e., answers to the RQ)at stage one requires a lot of time, and the benefits of the apps are not obvious at this stage, motivating factors haveto be established in this context. Second, as can be observed from Table 2, we lose more Android users comparedto iOS users. This might be caused by a more appealing user interface of iOS. This explains the need of designingK.

Third, when it comes to notifications as shown inTable 3, for most of the user cases in which the ratio of custom notification is higher than the standard notification,we can assume that they are more tech-savvy. This can be explained by the fact that setting the custom notificationsrequires extra effort, whereas for standard notifications this is done automatically. Third, based on the figures of Table4, with the help of clinicians and psychologists, we can design new features (feature engineering) that will the help usto make more accurate predictions, which, in turn, can help patients to better understand their tinnitus.5. Related WorkIncentive management in the context of crowdsensing is a relatively unexplored area, although we observe somepromising work in the field in the last couple of years. A recent work from 2017 [4] illustrates the taxonomy of incen-tive mechanism specifically designed for health-related data. Thereby, [4] classifies the data collection into two broadcategories of general purpose and specific purpose. However, the authors of [4] accurately identified the challengeswith this taxonomy, i.e., quality of information, coverage, sample maximization, sample accuracy, and cost minimiza-tion that needs further attention. Another promising work was presented in 2012 [15], in which the authors designedincentive mechanism models using platform-centric and user-centric models. For the former model they used theStackelberg Game and for the later they designed an auction-based incentive mechanism. Although they claim to haveachieved a Stackelberg equilibrium, they do not show the backward induction to prove this equilibrium. Moreover, tothe best of our knowledge, they designed two different models placing focus on platform utility maximization rather8K. Agrawal et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2018) 000–000than to achieve an ecosystem equilibrium. Finally, Amazons Mechanical Turk (MTurk) [1] is a web-based solutionand one of the biggest examples of crowdsourcing technology today. MTurk allows its users to register either as arequester, where one can create tasks and receive compensations, or as a worker, where one can earn money for taskcompletion. However, MTurk has limitations in terms of ecological validity of conducted studies and robust supportfor participant assignments [6]. Moreover, MTurk is focused towards the micro-task markets and relies solely onmonetary incentives.6. Summary and OutlookThis paper gave insights into the TYT mobile crowdsensing platform with the goal to reveal aspects that can bethe basis for an incentive management for TYT in particular and mobile crowdsensing platforms in the context ofdisease management in general. A conceptual framework was sketched, which is our basis for further developmentsin this context. The considerations the framework is based on were discussed along insights of the TYT platform. Weshowed that many analyzed results indicate that a proper incentive management can be addressed. One direction wecurrently pursue is the application of machine learning algorithms to reveal even more valuable insights to data thatwas gathered with TYT. In general, incentive management becomes increasingly important in the context of eHealthand mHealth applications and platforms.Acknowledgements and FundingThis paper is part of the ESIT project [12] that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 722046.References[1] Buhrmester, M., et al., 2011.
