These studies have mainly focused on investigating which alternativewould be appropriate for which conflicting situation, under the assumption that a conflict is identified. The issue of detection(or identification) of conflict among evidence has been ignored. In this paper, we formally define when two basic belief assignmentsare in conflict. This definition deploys quantitative measures of both the mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset beforenormalization and the distance between betting commitments of beliefs. We argue that only when both measures are high, it is safeto say the evidence is in conflict. This definition can be served as a prerequisite for selecting appropriate combination rules.© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionWhen the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence (DS theory) first appeared as a mechanism to model and reasonwith uncertain information in intelligent systems, criticisms on the counterintuitive results of applying Dempster’scombination rule to conflicting beliefs soon emerged (e.g., [18,28,29]) where an almost impossible choice (with avery lower degree of belief) by both sources came up as the most possible outcome (with a very high degree of belief).Since then, alternative combination rules have been explored to recommend where the mass of the conflictingbelief from the two sources should land (e.g., [4,19,26]). Recently, due to the increasing applications of DS theory inintelligent fusion processes, Dempster’s combination rule and its alternatives have been under the microscope again(e.g., [10,13,14,21]).In [13], the three well-known alternatives, i.e., Smets’s unnormalized combination rule (known as the conjunctivecombination rule) [19], Dubois and Prade’s disjunctive combination rule [4], and Yager’s combination rule, are ex-amined and a general combination framework is proposed. This new framework has a component that re-distributesthe mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset (the false assumption) in a flexible way that it specifieswhich subsets can share this mass and by what proportions. In this way, the three alternatives listed above can all besubsumed by the framework.E-mail address: w.liu@qub.ac.uk (W. Liu).0004-3702/$ – see front matter © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924In [14], the weighted average is recommended in certain situations, such as, one piece of evidence contradicts withseveral other pieces of evidence which are consistent, to preserve the opinion from majority sources.While the above two papers are still circling around the well-known alternatives, the method proposed in [10] takesa different approach. A new operator called the consensus operator is proposed which reduces a basic belief assign-ment on a set of values into a basic belief assignment on a binary set (a set with only two values), the combination isthen carried out on this binary set. Three examples, two are commonly regarded as involving conflicting beliefs andone is with consistent beliefs, are examined in comparison with Dempster’s rule of combination. It was concludedthat the consensus operator could always produce a rational result for combining even conflicting beliefs. However,since this method always focuses on two elements when performing combinations, it may not be suitable for manycomplex situations where multiple values (not just two) should be preserved.Furthermore, the consensus operator approach does not provide any indication whether the evidence to be combinedmay be conflicting. As it was concluded by the author “by looking at the result only, it does not tell whether the originalbeliefs were in harmony or in conflict” [10].To justify whether original beliefs are in conflict has a big impact on selecting alternative combination rules [21].So far there are no general mechanisms to measure the degree of conflict other than using the mass of the combinedbelief assigned to the emptyset before normalization, i.e., m⊕(∅) (see its definition in Section 2). In this paper, wemainly focus on this rather ignored topic. We study quantitatively when two sources can be defined as conflict. Weargue that the conventional explanation that a high mass value of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset beforenormalization indicates a conflict among the original beliefs may not always be accurate. For example, if we havetwo distinct and totally reliable sources providing two basic belief assignments m1 and m2 as m1(si) = m2(si) = 0.2(i = 1, 2, . . . , 5), then combining these basic belief assignments with Dempster’s rule yields the mass being assignedto the emptyset as 0.8 before normalization. Under the current convention, this amount of mass would warrant averdict that these two pieces of evidence are in conflict and Dempster’s rule should not be used. In fact, these twopieces of evidence are consistent and using Dempster’s rule produces a new basic belief assignment which is identicalto either of them.In order to avoid a wrong claim made by using only m⊕(∅), we propose an alternative method to measure theconflict among beliefs using a pair of values, the mass of the combined belief allocated to the emptyset before normal-ization and the distance between betting commitments. We also investigate the effect of these measures on decidingwhen Dempster’ rule can be applied. We believe that this result is significant given that it decides subsequently whetherDempster’s rule is appropriate and if not, what other rule should be considered.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the basic definitions in DS theory. In Section 3,we first examine the commonly accepted convention that m⊕(∅) reveals the degree of conflict among two pieces ofevidence and the deficiency associated with this convention. We then investigate the meaning of pignistic transfor-mation and define the distance between betting commitments from two pignistic transformations. A formal definitionconsisting of two measures is proposed to judge when two pieces of evidence are in conflict. We also demonstrate thatthe distance between betting commitments is consistent with the distance between two pieces of evidence measuredby the method in [11]. In Section 4, we explore the properties and behaviour of this pair of measures. In Section 5,we look at the impact of this new definition on the decision of whether Dempster’s rule should be used in general andthen discuss in particular the cases which show the difference in the decisions when using only m⊕(∅) and using bothof the measures. Section 6 concludes the main contribution of the paper and discusses the difference between conflictanalysis and independence analysis among basic belief assignments.2. Basics of the Dempster–Shafer theoryWe review a few concepts commonly used in the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, as well as the conjunctivecombination rule [21] and the disjunctive combination rule [4]. Let Ω be a finite set called the frame of discernment.Definition 1. [20] A basic belief assignment (bba) is a mapping m : 2Ω → [0, 1] that satisfies(cid:2)A⊆Ω m(A) = 1.In Shafer’s original definition which he called the basic probability assignment [22], condition m(∅) = 0 is re-quired in Definition 1. Recently, some of the papers on Dempster–Shafer theory, especially since the establishmentW. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924911of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) [16], condition m(∅) = 0 is often omitted. A bba with m(∅) = 0 is called anormalized bba and is also known as a mass function.Definition 2. The belief function from a bba m is defined as bel : 2Ω → [0, 1],bel(A) =(cid:3)m(B).B⊆AWhen m(A) > 0, A is called a focal element of the belief function.Definition 3. [21] A categorical belief function is a belief function where its corresponding bba m satisfies(cid:4)m(B) =1 if B = A, where A (cid:6)= ∅, A (cid:6)= Ω, B ⊆ Ω,0 otherwise.(1)A categorical belief function has only one focal element and this element is neither empty nor the whole frame. Inother words, a categorical belief function assigns the total belief to a single proper subset of the frame.Definition 4. Let m1 and m2 be two bbas defined on frame Ω which are derived from two distinct sources. Let thecombined bba be m⊕ = m1 ⊕ m2 by Dempster’s rule of combination where ⊕ represents the operator of combination.Then(cid:2)m⊕(A) =B,C⊆Ω,B∩C=A m1(B)m2(C)(cid:2)B,C⊆Ω,B∩C=∅ m1(B)m2(C)1 −,∀A ⊆ Ω, A (cid:6)= ∅(cid:2)when(cid:2)B,C⊆Ω,B∩C=∅ m1(B)m2(C) (cid:6)= 1.B,C⊆Ω,B∩C=∅ m1(B)m2(C) is the mass of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset before normalizationand we denote it as m⊕(∅). In the following, whenever we use m⊕(∅), we always associate it with this explanationunless otherwise explicitly stated.The above rule is meaningful only when m⊕(∅) (cid:6)= 1, otherwise, the rule cannot be applied.Definition 5. [21] Let m1 and m2 be two bbas defined on frame Ω. Their conjunctive combination, denoted asm ∩(cid:9) = m1 ∩(cid:9) m2, is a new bba on Ω defined as:(cid:3)m ∩(cid:9)(A) =m1(B)m2(C),B,C⊆Ω,B∩C=A∀A ⊆ Ω,where ∩(cid:9) represents the operator of combination.Definition 6. [4] Let m1 and m2 be two bbas defined on frame Ω. Their disjunctive combination, denoted as m ∪(cid:9) =m1 ∪(cid:9) m2, is a new bba on Ω defined as:(cid:3)m ∪(cid:9)(A) =m1(B)m2(C),∀A ⊆ ΩB,C⊆Ω,B∪C=Awhere ∪(cid:9) represents the operator of combination.The conjunctive combination rule is applied when it is assumed that the two (distinct) pieces of evidence are bothreliable. When only one of the two is fully reliable, but it is not clear which source it is, the disjunctive combinationrule is recommended.Definition 7. [20] Let m be a bba on Ω. Its associated pignistic probability function BetPm : Ω → [0, 1] is defined asBetPm(ω) =(cid:3)A⊆Ω,ω∈A1|A|m(A)1 − m(∅), m(∅) (cid:6)= 1where |A| is the cardinality of subset A.912W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924BetPm can be extended as a function on 2Ω as BetPm(A) =(cid:2)is called the pignistic transformation. When an initial bba gives m(∅) = 0, m(A)we always assume that function BetPm has been extended to 2Ω .ω∈A BetPm(ω). The transformation from m to BetPm1−m(∅) is reduced to m(A). In the following,BetPm(A) tells what is the total mass value that A can carry and it is referred to as the betting commitment to A.Function BetPm is named the probability expectation function in [10].3. Relationship between basic belief assignments3.1. m⊕(∅) versus conflictSo far we have used the word “conflict” without giving it an explicit explanation. In this subsection we investigatewhat it means when “two pieces of evidence (or two beliefs) are in conflict” in the context of Dempster–Shafer theoryin the literature and how it is associated with m⊕(∅).Let us first look at the following example.Example 1. Let Ω be a frame of discernment with four elements {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4}. Assume two bbas, from two distinctsources, are defined as1(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:6)(cid:6)m1m2= 0.9, m1= 0.0, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5){ω3}= 0.1, m1= 0.1, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}= 0.0,= 0.9.Combining them using Dempster’s rule leads to a new bba m⊕ with m⊕({ω3}) = 1.0 and m⊕(∅) = 0.99 beforenormalization.Neither of the two strongly preferred choices by the two sources is preserved and the least preferred choice by thetwo sources is given the full credit after the combination with Dempster’s rule.The first source is almost certain that the true hypothesis is either ω1 or ω2, whilst the second source is almostcertain that the true hypothesis is ω4. Since at most one and only one of these three hypotheses can be true, the beliefsfrom both sources cannot be held simultaneously. Hence these two beliefs largely contradict with each other. Whenthis happens, it is said that the two beliefs are in conflict. Following this analysis, we give the following qualitativedefinition of conflict between two beliefs.Definition 8. A conflict between two beliefs in DS theory can be interpreted qualitatively as one source strongly sup-ports one hypothesis and the other strongly supports another hypothesis, and the two hypotheses are not compatible.In Example 1, if we revise the two bbas as:(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)m1(cid:12)m2(cid:12)= 1.0, m1(cid:12)= 0.0, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5){ω3}(cid:12)= 0.0, m1(cid:12)= 0.0, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}= 0.0,= 1.0then these two bbas totally contradict with each other. This is the situation when the maximal conflict occurs. Further-more, the extreme case of maximal conflict appears when m1(ωi) = 1 for bba m1 and m2(ωj ) = 1 for bba m2, andωi (cid:6)= ωj , where one source is absolutely sure that ωi is the right hypothesis and the other source is absolutely surethat ωj is the right hypothesis.On the other hand, the total absence of conflict occurs when two bbas are identical. In this situation, whateversupported by one bba is equally supported by the other bba and there is no slightest difference in their beliefs. Theextreme case of total absence of conflict is when m1(A) = m2(A) = 1, especially when |A| = 1.Example 2. Let the first pair of bbas from two distinct sources on frame Ω = {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5} be:1 This example shares the same spirit as the famous Peter, Mary, Paul murder suspect example. We include more elements in the frame to facilitatesubsequent examples in the paper.W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924913(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω1}(cid:5){ω1}m1m2= 0.2, m1= 0.2, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω2}(cid:5){ω2}= 0.2, m1= 0.2, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5){ω3}= 0.2, m1= 0.2, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}= 0.2, m1= 0.2, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω5}(cid:5){ω5}= 0.2,= 0.2.Dempster’s rule produces a combined bba, denoted as m⊕, which is identical to either of the two original ones andgenerates m⊕(∅) = 0.8 before normalization.Now let the second pair of bbas from two distinct sources on the same frame be:(cid:6)(cid:5){ω1}(cid:5){ω1}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}Combining these two bbas produces m(cid:12)= 0.4, m3= 0.4, m4m3m4(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω1, ω2, ω3}(cid:5){ω1, ω2, ω3}= 0.4, m3= 0.4, m4⊕(∅) = 0.0 for the combined bba m(cid:12)= 0.2,= 0.2.(cid:6)⊕.In this example, the two pairs of bbas have different characteristics. The bbas in the first pair are actually probabilitydistributions and the corresponding belief functions are fully dissonant whilst the two bbas in the second pair havenested sets of focal elements and their corresponding belief functions are in fact necessity measures in possibilitytheory and are therefore fully consonant [2,9].So far, in Dempster–Shafer theory, value m⊕(∅) is commonly taken as the quantitative measure of this qualitativedefinition of conflict (e.g., [22]).With regard to Example 1, qualitatively, the two beliefs are in conflict; quantitatively, the m⊕(∅) value is verylarge. Therefore, the m⊕(∅) value seems to accurately reflect the meaning of the qualitative analysis. Furthermore,Dempster’s rule indeed produces a result that is counterintuitive. As a consequence, there is no dispute about usingm⊕(∅) as a quantitative measure of conflict in this case and all other similar examples appeared in the literature.However, if we look into Example 2, we see a different picture. First, if we follow the above convention inDempster–Shafer theory and use the m⊕(∅) value as the quantitative measure of conflict in beliefs, then the twobbas in the first pair could be classified as in conflict since m⊕(∅) = 0.8. This conclusion is obviously wrong becausewe know already that these two bbas completely agree with each other although both bbas have lower confidence inevery possible hypothesis. Second, m(cid:12)⊕(∅) = 0.0 goes nicely with the fact that the two bbas in the second pair sharetotally the same beliefs. However, in general, it is very likely that m⊕(∅) > 0 holds for two identical bbas exceptwhen they have nested focal elements (like the second pair). Therefore, m⊕(∅) values have no direct relationship withwhether the two bbas under consideration are identical, i.e., absence of conflict.In summary, it is not difficult to conclude from the above investigation that not all high m⊕(∅) values indicatea conflict that can be satisfactorily interpreted qualitatively. As demonstrated by the first pair of bbas in Example 2,where the m⊕(∅) value before normalization is high, but the two beliefs cannot be classified as in conflict qualitatively.These examples prompt us to conclude that value m⊕(∅) cannot be used as a quantitative measure of conflictbetween two beliefs, contrary to what has long been taken as a fact in the Dempster–Shafer theory community.We argue that m⊕(∅) only represents the mass of uncommitted belief (orfalsely committed belief ) as a result ofcombination.Since m⊕(∅) itself is not sufficient as the quantitative measure of conflict between two beliefs, we must look intoother criteria in order to reveal the relationship between two bbas. Let us recall the result of pignistic transformationBetPm. If BetPm1 and BetPm2 are two pignistic probability functions for two bbas, then what does |BetPm1(A) −BetPm2(A)| reveal about A?3.2. Betting commitment versus conflictExample 3. Let two bbas from two distinct sources on frame Ω = {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4} be(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:6)(cid:6)m1m2(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)= 0.8, m1= 0.1, m2{ω3}{ω3}= 0.1, m1= 0.1, m2(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}= 0.1,= 0.8.Combining them with Dempster’s rule gives m⊕(∅) = 0.83 before normalization. Let A = {ω4} (where focal elementA has the highest mass value in at least one bba), then the betting commitments to A from the two bbas areBetPm1(A) = 0.1, BetPm2(A) = 0.8914W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924and the difference between them is(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)BetPm1(A) − BetPm2(A)(cid:7) = 0.7which is high. It indicates that there is a significant difference from the two sources in believing that the true event isin A. At the same time, the mass of uncommitted belief after combination is also very high (m⊕(∅) = 0.83).When both of these values are high, it could be the case that the large difference between betting commitmentshas contributed to the high amount of uncommitted belief (m⊕(∅)). However, these two measures can differ in othersituations as demonstrated by the following example.Example 4. Let m1 and m2 be two bbas defined in Example 2 (the first pair). Let A be a subset of the frame, say {ω1},and BetPm1 and BetPm2 be the results of two pignistic transformations from m1 and m2 respectively, then(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)BetPm1(A) − BetPm2(A)(cid:7) = 0.2 − 0.2 = 0.0which indicates that there is no difference between betting commitments to A from the two sources (and in fact to anysubset).In this example, two consistent beliefs result in no difference between betting commitments to any subset, whilstthe mass of uncommitted belief after combination is still very high (0.8). Therefore, this amount of uncommittedbelief cannot come from the difference between betting commitments but from other reasons, as a consequence, thesetwo measures tell us two different aspects of the bbas involved.Definition 9. Let m1 and m2 be two bbas on frame Ω and let BetPm1 and BetPm2 be the results of two pignistictransformations from them respectively. ThendifBetPm2m1= maxA⊆Ω(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)BetPm1(A) − BetPm2(A)(cid:7)(cid:6)is called the distance between betting commitments of the two bbas.Value (|BetPm1(A) − BetPm2(A)|) is the difference between betting commitments to A from the two sources. Thedistance of betting commitments is therefore the maximum extent of the differences between betting commitments toall the subsets. difBetPm2m1 is simplified as difBetP when there is no confusion as which two bbas are being compared.Obviously, difBetPm2= 0 whenever m1 = m2, i.e., the distance between betting commitments is always 0 betweenm1any two identical bbas (total absence of conflict).Given two bbas and their corresponding pignistic transformations, it is possible that these two bbas have the samebetting commitment to a subset A (that is, BetPm1(A) = BetPm2(A)), but have rather different betting commitmentsto another subset B. For this reason, we cannot use either min or mean to replace operator max in the above definition,since we want to find out the maximum, not the minimum or the average, level of differences between their bettingcommitments.Notation difBetP coincides with the error measurement between a belief function and its approximation definedin [24], where BetPm1 and BetPm2 represent pignistic probability functions of a belief function and its approximationrespectively.3.3. Conflict between basic belief assignmentsAfter analyzing the nature of both m⊕(∅) and difBetP, we are now ready to quantitatively define when two bbascan be said in conflict.Definition 10. Let m1 and m2 be two bbas. Let cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)m⊕(∅), difBetP(cid:14) be a two-dimensional measure wherem⊕(∅) is the mass of uncommitted belief when combining m1 and m2 with Dempster’s rule and difBetP be the distancebetween betting commitments in Definition 9. m1 and m2 are defined as in conflict iff both difBetP > ε and m⊕(∅) > εhold, where ε ∈ [0, 1] is the threshold of conflict tolerance.W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924915Since there does not exist an “absolute meaningful threshold” of conflict tolerance satisfying all pairs of bbas [1],the choice of ε is largely subjective and application oriented. In general, the closer ε is to 1.0, the greater the conflicttolerance is. If we let ε be 0.8, then according to Definition 10 the bbas in Example 3 are in conflict. However, if weupgrade the threshold to 0.9, then the two bbas are not in conflict.The need to use two measures instead of one in Definition 10 is further illustrated by the following example.Example 5. Let m1 and m2 be two bbas from two distinct sources on Ω = {ω1, . . . , ω5} as(cid:6)(cid:6)= 0.8, m1(cid:5){ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5}= 0.2,and(cid:5){ω1}m1m2(Ω) = 1.Then the mass of uncommitted belief is 0.0, i.e., m⊕(∅) = 0.0, when m1 and m2 are combined with Dempster’s rule,which is traditionally explained as there is no conflict between the two bbas. Indeed, they do not contradict with eachother as what is qualitatively defined in Definition 8. However, m1 is more committed whilst m2 is less sure aboutits preference. The difference in their opinions is reflected by difBetP = 0.6. It says that the two sources have ratherdifferent beliefs as where the true hypothesis lies.To summarize, a large distance between betting commitments alone does not guarantee that the beliefs underconsideration can be qualitatively interpreted as in conflict, nor does a high m⊕(∅) value itself. Only these two valuestogether can serve this purpose.3.4. Betting commitment versus a distance measure approachIn [11], a method for measuring the distance between bbas is proposed. This distance is defined as(cid:8)dBPA(m1, m2) =12( (cid:15)m1 − (cid:15)m2)T D= ( (cid:15)m1 − (cid:15)m2)D= is a (2Ω × 2Ω )-dimensional matrix with d[i, j ] = |A ∩ B|/|A ∪ B|, and A ∈ 2Ω , B ∈ 2Ω are the nameswhereof columns and rows respectively (note, we define |∅ ∩ ∅|/|∅ ∪ ∅| = 0). Given a bba m on frame Ω, (cid:15)m is a 2Ω -dimensional column vector (can also be called a 2Ω × 1 matrix) with mA∈2Ω (A) as its 2Ω coordinates.( (cid:15)m1 − (cid:15)m2) stands for vector subtraction and ( (cid:15)m)T is the transpose of vector (or matrix) (cid:15)m. When (cid:15)m is a 2Ω -dimensional column vector, ( (cid:15)m)T is its 2Ω -dimensional row vector with the same coordinates. (( (cid:15)m)T D= (cid:15)m) thus is theresult of normal matrix multiplications (twice).For example, let Ω = {a, b} be the frame and let m({a}) = 0.6, m(Ω) = 0.4 be a bba on Ω. Then⎢⎣(cid:15)m =⎡⎤⎥⎦0.00.60.00.4is a 4-dimensional column vector with row names (∅, {a}, {b}, Ω) and ( (cid:15)m)T = [0.0 0.6 0.0 0.4] is the correspondingD= is thus a 4 × 4 square matrix with (∅, {a}, {b}, Ω) as the namesrow vector with column names (∅, {a}, {b}, Ω).for both rows and columns. (( (cid:15)m)T D= (cid:15)m) therefore means that matrix ( (cid:15)m)T is multiplied byD= first to produce a new4-dimensional row vector and then this row vector is multiplied by column vector (cid:15)m to obtain a single numericalresult.In the examples provided by [11], among two bbas, one of them is always a categorical belief function, i.e., thetotal mass value is awarded to a proper subset of the whole frame. Most of the time, this subset contains only a singleelement.We now take an example from the paper (Example 2, Fig. 6 in [11]) to see the relationship between the distancemeasure (dBPA) and the distance between betting commitments (difBetP).Example 6. Let Ω be a frame of discernment with 20 elements (or any number of elements that is pre-defined). Weuse 1, 2, etc. to denote element 1, element 2, etc. in the frame. The first bba, m1, is defined as916W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924(cid:5){2, 3, 4}(cid:6)m1= 0.05, m1(cid:6)(cid:5){7}= 0.05, m1(Ω) = 0.1, m1(A) = 0.8,where A is a subset of Ω.

However,the difBetP values are always smaller than the corresponding dBPA values, because the former selects the maximumvalue of the differences between betting commitments to all the subsets while the latter is the accumulated distancebetween two bbas.The major drawback of dBPA is its inability to distinguish between a large mass of uncommitted belief (i.e., m⊕(∅)is large, but difBetP is small) and a large difference between betting commitments (i.e., m⊕(∅) is small, but difBetPis large). This situation can be seen in the last few cases where the distance measure dBPA between the two bbas isgetting larger along with the growth of the size of A. Clearly the change in distances is caused by the differencebetween betting commitments not the amount of uncommitted belief. In fact, in all the cases value m⊕(∅) remainsunchanged. The following example makes the situation even more explicit.Example 7. Let us consider three pairs of bbas on a frame with five elements:(cid:6)(cid:6)1st pair m11m12(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5){ω1, ω2, ω4}(cid:5){ω1, ω2}(cid:5)(cid:6){ω1}3rd pair m312((cid:5)) = 1.0.m32nd pair m21m22(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5){ω3}(cid:5)(cid:6){ω3}(cid:6)= 0.8, m11= 0.1, m12= 0.1, m11= 0.1, m12= 0.8, m21m22= 0.1,= 0.1, m21= 0.1, m22= 0.8, m31(cid:5){ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5}(cid:6)= 0.2,(cid:6)(cid:6)= 0.1,= 0.8;(cid:6)(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5){ω4}(cid:5)(cid:6){ω4}= 0.1,= 0.8;The summary of dBPA, difBetP, and m⊕(∅) values of the three pairs is given in Table 2.For the first pair the distance measure dBPA between them reflects both the high values of difBetP and m⊕(∅), whilethe distance measure dBPA in the third pair mainly reveals the difference between betting commitments of the pair,not the mass of uncommitted belief. By looking at these two dBPA values alone, it is not possible to tell the differencebetween the first and the third pairs.In summary, although the distance measure, dBPA, between two bbas is a useful indicator as how different the beliefdistributions from the evidence are, however, this value itself cannot differentiate whether a pair of bbas are in conflict.Since dBPA and difBetP behave similarly, an interesting question is whether difBetP can be replaced by dBPA inDefinition 10 with a slightly lower threshold. We argue that this substitution, although looks feasible, offers a lessaccurate measure of the maximum degree of the difference between betting commitments (i.e., the degree of con-tradiction) of the two beliefs. Let us look at Example 7 again. The first pair of bbas are more contradictory in theirbeliefs (one strongly believes in {ω1, ω2} and another strongly believes in {ω4}) than the two bbas in the third pairare. In the meantime, the difBetP value of the first pair is larger than that of the 3rd pair. That is, difBetP valuesare consistent with the severeness of the degree of contradiction in beliefs. In contrast, the dBPA value for the firstpair is smaller than that of the third pair, so these two values are not consistent with the severeness of the degreeof contradiction in beliefs. Therefore, difBetP is a better measure than dBPA for judging how contradict the two be-liefs are.918W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–9244. Properties and behaviour of the new measuresWe deploy the examples (called cases) detailed in Table 3 to assist the explanation of the properties and behaviourof the two measures of cf (m1, m2) defined in Definition 10. We assume that two bbas, m1 and m2, are from twodistinct sources. We first examine their properties.(cid:15)(cid:15)Bj ) = ∅, where Ai and Bj are the focal elements of the two beliefLemma 1. cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)1, 1(cid:14) iff (functions with m1 and m2 as their corresponding bbas.Ai) ∩ (Lemma 1 says that when cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)1, 1(cid:14), the two sources contradict completely in predicting what the truehypothesis is, i.e., the maximal conflict occurs, as shown by Case 10 in Table 3.Lemma 2. If two bbas belong to one of the categories below then cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)0.0, 0.0(cid:14): (a) identical categoricalbelief functions; (b) one of them is a vacuous belief function and the other is a probability function with evenlydistributed probabilities; (c) two identical bbas with identical nested sets of focal elements.Lemma 2 implies that when cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)0.0, 0.0(cid:14), the two bbas do not have even slightest contradiction inpredicting what the true hypothesis is, see Cases 11 and 12 of Table 3 for the first two situations.Lemma 3. cf (m0 ⊕ m1, m0 ⊕ m2) (cid:6)= cf (m1, m2) for most bbas.For example, if we let m1 and m2 be the two bbas as defined in Case 5 of Table 3, and m0 be a bba as(cid:6)(cid:5){1, 2}m0= 0.8, m0(cid:6)(cid:5){1, 3}= 0.2,then cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)0.0, difBetP(cid:14) whilst cf (m0 ⊕ m1, m0 ⊕ m2) = (cid:13)m⊕(∅) > 0.0, difBetP(cid:14), where m⊕(∅) is the massof uncommitted belief after combining bbas obtained from m0 ⊕ m1 and m0 ⊕ m2 respectively.All these lemmas can be proved easily.Let us now describe the behaviour of cf (m1, m2). Given two bbas, m1 and m2, that are from distinct sources,there are four situations as how this pair of measures, cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)m⊕(∅), difBetP(cid:14), would reveal the relationshipbetween the bbas.A: when both m⊕(∅) and difBetP have very low values, this pair of values indicate that there is little contradictionbetween m1 and m2, although there exists a focal element A of m1 and B of m2 such that A ∩ B = ∅, see Case 8 inTable 3. The extreme situation for this category is cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)0.0, 0.0(cid:14).B: when m⊕(∅) has a relatively high value and difBetP has a relatively low value, this pair of values indicate thatthe two bbas have no apparent severe difference between betting commitments. However, most of the pairs of focalelements from the two bbas may have the empty intersection. It is also highly likely that none of the focal elementshas a particularly high mass value, see Case 9 in Table 3. The extreme situation for this category is when difBetP = 0.0which suggests that there is no difference between their betting commitments, see Case 2 in Table 3.C: when m⊕(∅) has a relatively low value and difBetP has a relatively high value, this pair of values indicate astrong difference between betting commitments, but with little amount of mass of uncommitted belief. Therefore,the focal elements from the two belief functions that do not share any common elements (empty intersection) cannotboth have large amounts of mass values, such as Case 7 in Table 3. The extreme situation for this category is whenm⊕(∅) = 0.0, such as Case 3 in Table 3.D: both m⊕(∅) and difBetP have high values. This pair of values reveal that the difference between betting com-mitments is high and the mass of uncommitted belief is also high. This is the situation where the two bbas may be saidin conflict, subject to the actual value of the threshold of conflict tolerance, such as Case 6 in Table 3. The extremesituation for this category is cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)1, 1(cid:14).The graphical illustration of these situations is given in Fig. 2. The dark grey square within rectangle C in Fig. 2shows those situations where m⊕(∅) is small and which can be mistaken as that Dempster’s rule is applicable. IfDempster’s rule is applied, most of the masses of the combined belief will be assigned to some very small intersectionsubsets, since a high difBetP value means that many of the focal elements from the two bbas create either an emptyintersection or a small intersection. The dotted square within rectangle B shows those situations where m⊕(∅) isW. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924919Table 3Twelve cases of two bbas on Ω with |Ω| = 10.

The two squares and two rectangles, denoted as A, D, B and C respectively,generated by the dotted lines starting with 0.25 on both axes correspond to the four situations above.large and which traditionally suggests that Dempster’s rule cannot be applied. On the contrary, this square containsthose cases where applying Dempster’s rule produces rational results, since the high m⊕(∅) value is likely due tothe low masses assigned to the focal elements, not the difference between betting commitments. The dotted trianglein square D shows some delicate situations. For example, when the (m⊕(∅), difBetP) pair is closer to square A, itmight still be feasible to apply Dempster’s rule, but when the pair is further away from square A, it becomes moreproblematic to apply the rule.5. Impact on applying Dempster’s ruleThere are several alternative combination rules to Dempster’s original version that aim at merging a pair of bbaswhen it is believed that Dempster’s rule is not adequate to use. In [21], Smets discussed in detail which rule shouldbe used for what situation for both the categorical and general bba combinations. For example, when the mass of thecombined belief m⊕(∅) (cid:6)= 0.0 and it is believed that one source is reliable and the other is not, the disjunctive rule [4]should be used. Alternatively, when there is no apparent reason for conflict, register the conflict with the conjunctiverule (the unnormalized Dempster’s rule) [21].In summary, no matter for categorical or general bba combinations in [21] or in any other papers that investigate thealternative combination rules, as long as the combined m⊕(∅) (cid:6)= 0.0 (especially when this value is high), Dempster’srule of combination is deemed to be inadequate. In this paper, we have demonstrated using various examples thatthis convention does not always hold. We argue that Dempster’s rule gives the most acceptable results in some of thesituations where traditionally this rule is excluded from use on the basis that the m⊕(∅) value is high. On the otherhand, the perception that Dempster’s rule is applicable whenever m⊕(∅) = 0.0 is questioned when the application920W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924of the rule narrows down the conclusion considerably. Therefore, we propose the following definition to recommendwhen Dempster’s rule should be used and when it should not, given two bbas from two distinct sources.Definition 11. Let cf (m1, m2) = (cid:13)m⊕(∅), difBetP(cid:14) be the two-dimensional measure defined in Definition 10 for bbasm1 and m2 from two distinct sources. Dempster’s rule of combination is not applicable when Condition 1 holds;Dempster’s rule of combination is advised not to be applied when Condition 2 holds; Dempster’s rule of combinationshould be applied with caution when Condition 3 holds; and Dempster’s rule is applicable when Condition 4 holds1. m1 and m2 are in conflict according to Definition 10 (such as when ε = 0.85),2. difBetP (cid:2) ε2,3. difBetP ∈ (ε1, ε2),4. difBetP (cid:3) ε1.Here threshold ε1 ∈ [0, 1] is assumed sufficiently small, such as 0.3 and threshold ε2 ∈ [0, 1] is assumed sufficientlylarge, such as 0.8.All these thresholds are subject to individual application requirements and indeed there is a very fine line (or agrey area) between Conditions 2 and 3. We will discuss the implications of these threshold values in Section 5.3.Condition 1 covers typical cases where a counterintuitive result will be generated, if the rule is used, as commonlyaccepted. The 2nd condition says that the rule should not be applied since it may eliminate most of the possiblehypotheses given in the original evidence, even though the combined result is not necessarily counterintuitive. Anexception to this scenario is when one bba is a vacuous belief function and the other assigns a high proportion of itsbelief to a subset. In this case the combined result does not eliminate hypotheses that are strongly supported by the2nd bba. Our definition above does not include this situation, as we believe that combining a vacuous belief functionwith another bba is less interesting in practice. It should be pointed out that although Condition 2 subsumes Condi-tion 1 and it can be refined to exclude Condition 1, i.e., to include a condition on m⊕(∅), we feel that the currentdescription of Condition 2 is simpler and Condition 1 should always be checked before Condition 2 is applied. The3rd condition advises that the rule should be used cautiously in order not to eliminate the true hypothesis duringcombination, although the result may not appear counterintuitive. Finally, the 4th condition implies two situations:(1) when m⊕(∅) is small, the rule is perfectly applicable, as it is understood and practiced with most of the appli-cations of DS theory; (2) when m⊕(∅) is large, the rule is still applicable, as contrary to what most of the literatureconcluded.5.1. Categorical belief functionsNow we apply this rule selection principle to categorical belief functions first.Let two bbas from two distinct sources be m1 and m2 where each has one focal element with certainty. Let theframe of discernment be Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ω10}. We consider 10 cases listed in Table 4. The “Rule selection” columnindicates our conclusions as whether Dempster’s rule should be used based on Definition 11, in particular, the bold-faced suggestions are against the commonly accepted protocol.For Cases 1 and 2, it is clear from Definition 10 that the two bbas are in conflict, therefore, there is no ambiguitythat Dempster’s rule should not be applied.For all the other cases, the common feature is that the mass of uncommitted belief gives m⊕(∅) = 0.0. Therefore,the default combination rule is Dempster’s and the combined belief is assigned to the intersection of the two focalelements from the two bbas, regardless the size of each focal element as well as the size of the interaction. However,the distance between betting commitments gives a range of values which are almost in the reverse order of the ratio|A∩B|between the commonly supported subset (the intersection) and the union of the two focal elements, i.e.,|A∪B| . Whenthe distance between two betting commitments is low, such as Case 10, Dempster’s rule is recommended to combinethe bbas. However, when this value is high, such as Case 4, it is questionable whether the intersection of the two focalelements should still be the subset that carries all the combined belief, since these two bbas only agree on a smallcollection of elements.W.

General belief functionsLet us now re-examine the cases reported in Table 3 with Definition 11. Similar to Table 4, in Table 5 the bold-facedsuggestions in the “Rule selection” column are based on Definition 11 and are in disagreement with traditional viewsof using Dempster’s rule.We first look at Cases 2 and 9 in detail. Both cases work well with Dempster’s rule, so does the rule of average.However, other rules all fail. In Case 2, the mass of uncommitted belief (m⊕(∅)) is very high, yet this does not affectthe use of Dempster’s rule. Case 9 would be another similar example where Dempster’s rule produces the same resultas the average operator. Next, let us compare Cases 6 and 7. Based on Condition 3 of Definition 11, both cases can be922W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924Fig. 3. Squares F and E are generated by the dotted lines starting with values b and a on both axes respectively, where k = m⊕(∅).combined with Dempster’s rule with caution. However, an interesting question is shall we be more cautious of Case 6than of Case 7?To summarize, a large m⊕(∅) value itself does not rule out the possible application of Dempster’s rule. On thecontrary, a large m⊕(∅) value coupled with a lower difBetP value strongly suggest the use of Dempster’s rule.5.3. Where the boundary liesWhen defining conflict in Definition 10, we require that both of the values, m⊕(∅) and difBetP, are greater thana threshold ε. An important question facing this is how large should ε be. We argue that the choice of ε is entirelysubjective to the nature of an application. If an application can tolerate only a small amount of difference betweentwo sources, then ε has to be a relatively smaller value such as 0.75 (square F in Fig. 3 shows the conflict situations).On the other hand, if it is possible to tolerate a great deal of difference between sources, then ε can be very closeto 1.0 (square E in Fig. 3 shows the conflict situations). The former says that two sources have to be largely consis-tent to avoid being called in conflict, while the latter says that only when two sources provide highly contradictoryinformation, they can be said in conflict.Another interesting point with Definition 10 is whether we need one threshold for both measures or we need twodifferent thresholds. Indeed, if two different thresholds are chosen, then it indicates that the measure that requiresa smaller threshold plays a more important role than the other measure. For instance, when the threshold for difBetP is1.0, cf (m1, m2) is reduced to the situation where only m⊕(∅) is essential. Likewise, when the threshold for m⊕(∅) is1.0, cf (m1, m2) is reduced to the situation where only difBetP is useful. As we have demonstrated in examples earlier,neither of the two measures alone is capable of defining a conflict accurately. Therefore, both thresholds are essentialto ensure that the two measures are used adequately.Finally, it is a very fine line between when to caution the use of Dempster’s rule and when not to use the rule, asshown between rectangles G and H in Fig. 3. To be more precise, when is difBetP too large so that not to use the ruleand when is it large enough to caution the rule? The same question applies to the boundary between Conditions 3and 4 in Definition 11. It is assumed these thresholds are fuzzy linguistic terms, just like how tall is tall in terms of aperson’s height, and there will be no universally agreed thresholds to satisfy all the applications.6. ConclusionsAnalyzing the relationship between a pair of bbas is important given that different combination rules can producerather different results. A common perception of rejecting Dempster’s rule is when the mass of uncommitted beliefm⊕(∅) is large and this value is widely taken as the reflection of conflict between the given beliefs. In this paper, wehave investigated what really constitutes a conflict among two bbas. We examine not only the m⊕(∅) value but also thedistance between betting commitments, and conclude that only this pair of values together can reveal a real conflict.Neither m⊕(∅) nor difBetP taken alone is adequate to precisely describe a conflict between two bbas. Whether thereexists a single numerical measure, or another measure that can replace difBetP, to serve the same purpose as that ofcf (m1, m2) remains to be an interesting question which deserves to be further investigated.We also proposed a set of rules guiding whether Dempster’s rule can be used, should be cautioned, is advised notto be used, or cannot be applied at all. The rejection of Dempster’s combination rule on the ground that m⊕(∅) isW. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924923large alone is no longer valid. Instead, this guideline can be applied along with suitability selected thresholds to tailora particular application. When Dempster’s rule is not applicable, the analysis of what has caused this and what otherrule can substitute it is thoroughly discussed in [21].In the past, apart from using m⊕(∅) as the quantitative measure of conflict among two bbas, some other methodswere proposed to measure the conflict or confusion or non-specificity in a single belief function, such as [3,5,8,12,17,25]. Since these approaches are designed for a single belief function only, they cannot be used to measure the conflictamong pairs of belief functions in general and hence are not comparable with our method. Nevertheless, one may beattempted to apply these measures to the combined and unnormalized bba after combining two bbas with Dempster’srule. However, great care should be taken when using these measures. First, some of these methods are not applicablewhen m⊕(∅) > 0 (e.g., [8,25]), so adaptations of the methods are needed. Second, how should we interpret the valuecalculated with such a method, that is, are we examining this value on its own or are we comparing it with the results ofusing the same method to the two original bbas? These questions need to be fully investigated before these measuresshould be applied.Another issue often surrounding the applicability of Dempster’s rule is whether the two bbas to be combined areindependent. There have been many papers discussing this, among them notably [27], on the justification of applyingDempster’s rule. These discussions rely on the construction of an underlying probabilistic model to justify if the twobbas are probabilistically independent. In a situation where there does not exist an underlying probability model or itis too complex to establish the underlying probability model, the judgement of independence of the bbas cannot bedone. Furthermore, belief functions can be interpreted in two ways [6], one is to take them as generalized probabilitiesand another is to take them as representing evidence. For the latter case, evidence can be the result of an agent’sepistemic beliefs which does not necessarily come from probabilistic information. Two identical bbas do not suggestautomatically that they must be dependent.Nevertheless, it is worth to point out the distinction between the independence of sources and the independenceof observations. With two bbas m1 and m2 derived from two independent sources (e.g., readings from two distinctsensors), the conflict analysis method developed in this paper can tell if these two bbas are in conflict and thereforewhether they should be combined with Dempster’s combination rule or with an alternative rule. In contrast, whenthese two bbas are from the same source (e.g., two readings at different time points from the same sensor), the conflictanalysis between them can indicate whether there is a sudden change of the situation being observed (e.g., the target).Two bbas of this nature should not be combined regardless if they are in conflict. When there is no (or little) conflictbetween the two bbas, there is no dramatic change in the situation under observation. However, if the conflict doesexist, then either the situation has changed completely or the source (e.g., the sensor) fails to function properly. Ineither case, the cause of the change, that is, the cause of the conflict between the old and the new bbas should beinvestigated.The focus of this paper is not on the independence of bbas, rather, it is on whether two bbas are in conflict, nomatter whether one has the intension to apply Dempster’s rule. When one does want to combine two bbas fromdistinct sources, the conflict analysis between them defined in the paper will help to determine if Dempster’s rule isappropriate. Therefore, fundamentally, this paper discusses a totally different issue from the independence requirementin the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence.When bbas are taken as a method to model an agent’s beliefs, a bba defined by an agent can also be viewed as away of expressing the agent’s preferences over choices, with respect to masses assigned to different hypotheses (focalelements in terms of DS theory). The larger the mass assigned to a hypothesis is, the more preferred the hypothesisis. Therefore, hypotheses can be ordered according to the degree that they are preferred. Under this context, when thedegree of disagreement of preferences is high as defined in social choice theory, we may then be able to conclude thatthe agents’ beliefs are in conflict. An interesting future work here is whether numerous definitions of the degree ofdisagreement of preferences in social choice theory can be deployed to measure the conflict among bbas, and if so,how effective these measures could be in comparison with the approach proposed in this paper.Finally, we would like to mention briefly logic-based interpretations of belief functions which may give us someinsight on what a conflict means. Several papers (e.g. [7,15,23]) have discussed logic-based interpretations of DStheory, we follow the modal logic interpretation in [7] here. In terms of modal logic, the degree of belief on a hypoth-esis A (e.g., a subset A of a frame) can be taken as the accumulated sum of probabilities on those possible worldsin which A is necessarily true (defined by the valuation function with the modal operators). Let us denote the set ofpossible worlds (interpretations) in which A is necessarily true as Mod(A). Under this notation, two belief functions,924W. Liu / Artificial Intelligence 170 (2006) 909–924bel1 and bel2, are said in conflict when Mod(A) ∩ Mod(B) = ∅ holds, where both m1(A) and m2(B) for bel1 and bel2respectively are very large (close to 1). In other words, two belief functions are in conflict when there does not evenexist one possible world that simultaneously supports the two hypotheses that are believed strongly by the two belieffunctions.AcknowledgementI would like to express my sincere gratitude to Philippe Smets with whom I had numerous e-mail discussions aboutwhat a conflict was in the context of DS theory, and I would like to thank him for his critical remarks on the earlierversions of the paper. I would also like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments which havehelped me to improve the paper considerably.References[1] A. Ayoun, Ph.
