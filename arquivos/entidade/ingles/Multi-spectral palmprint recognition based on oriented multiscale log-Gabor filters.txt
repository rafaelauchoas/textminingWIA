IntroductionBiometric security is increasingly becoming an important tool to enhancesecurity and bring greater convenience to services requiring authentication andprotection of data. Deploying biometric security using physical or behavioral5traits for personal verification and identification [1] is useful in various applica-tions such as forensic science or access control thus resulting in an increase ofresearch interest. Several modalities have been studied and developed includingiris, face, gait, key-stroke, finger-print and palmprint [1] where some of themare already well known and widely used depending to the application domain.10The main factors of merits of palmprint images include reliability, stabil-ity, user friendliness, non-intrusiveness, flexibility and discriminating ability.These factors arise from a large selection of unique palmprint features includ-ing principal lines, wrinkles, ridges, minutiae points and texture. Although,palmprint recognition has been investigated during the last decade, this paper15aims to further improve the recognition accuracy, specifically by using multi-spectral imagery that provides more discriminating information in the featureextraction. The multi-spectral palmprint images are collected under differentspectra (called also spectral bands) peaking at different light wavelengths. Theabsorptive and reflective of human skin properties make different wavelengths20penetrate the skin layers differently, hence highlight particular features [2].Various palmprint recognition methods have been proposed recently, and2among them, coding-based approaches using multi-spectral palmprint imagesare attractive owing to their high recognition rates. In this research work, wepropose a novel multi-spectral palmprint recognition approach based on ori-25ented multiscale log-Gabor filters with the aim to further improve the perfor-mance of these approaches. The proposed approach enhances the recognitionperformances by proposing novel techniques at the three stages of a typicalbiometric cognition process: (i) using bitwise competitive coding, the featureextraction is based on a multi-resolution log-Gabor filtering where the final30feature map is composed by the winning codes of the lowest filters’ bank realresponse. (ii) Matching is performed by using the bitwise Hamming distance andthe Kullback-Leibler divergence as novel metric to capture efficiently the intra-and inter-spectral similarities between palmprint feature maps, at this stage,we have performed, through two novel features fusion techniques, a fusion of35the feature maps in order to eliminate the inherent redundancy of neighboringspectral bands features. (iii) Finally, the decision is carried out either from theobtained fused features similarity scores or from the classic fusion of the scores ofdifferent spectral bands aiming reduce overlapping. The experimental results ob-tained using the multi-spectral palmprint database MS-PolyU have shown that40the proposed method achieves high recognition accuracy for mono-spectral andmulti-spectral datasets for both verification and identification achieving up to0.0087 in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and 99.77% in terms of highest Iden-tification Rate (IR) at rank-1, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodoutperforms related state-of-the-art methods especially the similar method pro-45posed in [2] by up to -0.0034 in terms of EER for MS-PolyU database; and alsothe methods proposed in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].The remainder of this paper is as follows: Section 2 depicts related and rele-vant state-of the-art works. Section 3 describes in detail the proposed method-ology including the principle of a multi-spectral palmprint recognition system,50the feature extraction, the matching and the fusion strategies while the exper-iments and results carried out to validate the proposed methodology are givenin Section 4. Finally Section 5 concludes the paper.32. Related worksA crucial step in a typical palmprint recognition system revolves around the55feature extraction process which aims to provide and capture the most discrim-inating information from the extracted Region Of Interest (ROI). To achievethis, several available algorithms can be grouped as follows: structural-basedapproaches (e.g. minutiae based on SIFT or SURF features, lines based onSobel/Canny features, and local line directional patterns) [9, 10], appearance-60based approaches (e.g. sub space-based on EigenPalm and PCA) [11], statistical-based approaches (e.g., Gabor and Wavelet) [12, 2], coding-based approaches(e.g. phase such as palm-code) [13], and finally hybrid-approaches since theyuse various techniques (e.g. 2D FLPP) [14, 15].The success of coding-based methods, which encode the responses of a bank65of filters into bitwise features, have attracted our interest, particularly, the multi-scale scheme, where the palm lines can be represented at higher scales. Variousalgorithms inspired by this approach have been proposed. For example, Zhang etal. proposed an effective Palm-code algorithm in [12] based on a normalized 2DGabor filter. In [16], Kong et al. presented their competitive coding approach70where the dominant orientation is encoded. In [3], Jia et al. proposed the lineorientation code based on a modified Finite Radon transform which is similarto the competitive code; while Zuo et al. proposed in [17] a competitive codingusing multi-scale oriented 2D log-Gabor filters. Zhang et al.[2] proposed amulti-spectral approach where the features are extracted by competitive coding75using six oriented 2D Gabor filters for each spectral band followed by a score fu-sion at the recognition stage. In [4], the authors presented a joint palmprint andpalm-vein verification scheme where the authors fused the features extracted byGabor and matched filters from palmprint and vein-palm. Zuo et al. proposedin [18] a sparse competitive code based on second derivative of Gaussians with a80bank of eighteen multi-scale oriented filters. In [5], Tahmasebi et al. proposed aRank-Level Fusion for multi-spectral palmprint system using Gabor filter. Morerecently, based on a hierarchical approach in [19], Hong et al.fused a rough4feature extraction using a block dominant orientation code which is then refinedusing a block-based histogram of oriented gradients from the different spectral85bands. Cui et al. in [20] exploited a bidirectional representation based on pat-tern classification. On the other hand, Zhang et al. in [21] collected the recentadvanced research works on multi-spectral Biometrics including multi-spectralpalmprint recognition. In [22] Xu et al. proposed a novel multispectral palm-print recognition method based jointly on multiclass projection extreme learning90machine and digital Shearlet transform. Fei et al. proposed in [7] a palmprintrecognition method based on a double half-orientation where a bank of half-Gabor filters are defined for the half-orientation extraction. Another palmprintrecognition method was proposed in [8] using a double-orientation code basedon Gabor filters and nonlinear matching scheme. The proposed methods in [7, 8]95have been assessed on multi-spectral palmprint MS-PolyU database.Competitive coding is the association of a filtering process which exploitsneurophysiology-based Gabor function to capture the discriminative orientationinformation with a competitive rule: winner-takes-all using the palm line con-trast. It is a state-of-the-art texture-based feature extraction algorithm widely100used and is inspired from human vision’s system [16] which tends to comparepalm lines as a method/tool to compare palm images. These lines: (i) are spe-cific multi-scale features since the principal ones are robust and well representedat large scales whereas wrinkles at smaller ones may appear or disappear withchanges of lighting, (ii) can be categorized as positive when they are bright or105as negative when they are dark [23].In the spatial domain, a 2D Gabor function is a Gaussian multiplied by acomplex exponential and can be seen as a Gaussian shifted from the origin inthe Fourier domain. Its mathematical properties such as the smooth infinitelydifferentiable shape, the monomodal modulus and the highly joint localization110in space, orientation and frequency make it a good choice for various imageprocessing applications. In addition, 2D Gabor function can be used as a modelwhich follows as much as possible the neuroscience knowledge on the simplecells receptive field’s properties of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates5on the statistics of natural images [24].115However, this function has a few drawbacks: (i) non-orthogonality whichimplies non-invertibility witch is not really a problem in our feature extractionuse, (ii) its deficiency to cover uniformly the mid frequencies as it is a bandpassfilter, (iii) its bad coverage of low and high frequencies due to an excessive over-lapping, and (iv) the non-zero DC component which increases as the bandwidth120is widened resulting from the tails’ overlapping of the sum of two Gaussianscentered at plus and minus the central frequency.It is worth noting that natural images are better encoded using filters havingtransfer functions which are Gaussian viewed on the logarithmic frequency scale[25]. Therefore, a log-Gabor can be a better alternative to the Gabor filtering125since its transfer function is viewed on the logarithmic frequency scale includingthe constraint of the maximum bandwidth which limited to approximately oneoctave on Gabor filters which is not optimal if one is seeking a broader spectralinformation with maximal spatial localization. Therefore, that log-Gabor filterscan offer attractive power especially in image feature discrimination.130In this paper, we have chosen a multi-resolution approach which is justifiedby the properties of the palmprint lines discussed previously and by a physiolog-ical basis claiming that, for each location of a palmprint image, there are cellsthat cover at least three scales over a minimum of four octaves [26] in additionof an improved principal line’s representation at large scales.135Finally, our proposed approach aims to improve the efficiency of the com-petitive coding for palmprint recognition by using a multi-resolution log-Gaborfeature extraction scheme. This is achieved by proposing and combining twomatching processes on the same feature to enhance the generated matchingscores using a new fusion scheme of the different spectrum features.1403. Proposed methodologyThis section describes the proposed multi-spectral palmprint recognition pro-cess, feature extraction, coding and matching processes including the fusion6strategy at the score and feature levels. The multi-resolution log-Gabor filteris employed at the feature extraction stage to extract an indexed feature map145based on the competitive rule and encoded in Gray binary code as listed inTable 1 where the matching score between the final feature maps is computedusing bitwise Hamming distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on eachspectral band of the multi-spectral database used. In other words, this scorefusion is proposed to enhance the mono-spectral accuracy. Finally new feature’s150map fusions are proposed to further evaluate and appreciate the multi-spectraldiscriminating efficiency.3.1. Multi-spectral palmprint recognition processThe multi-spectral palmprint recognition system is illustrated in Figure 1where the user’s palms are captured under four different lights: Red, Blue,155Green and Near Infra Red denoted NIR. The corresponding ROIs are extractedas shown in Figure 2. A feature extraction is then carried out of the ROIs tocompute the resulting set of features which are stored in a reference databaseat the enrollment step. At the recognition stage, the same procedure is used toextract the set of features of a given user and matched against the features from160the reference database. A similarity score is finally employed so that a decisionof accepting or rejecting the requested user is made.3.2. Feature extractionCompetitive code uses the orientation and type of line information based onGabor filters and winner-takes-all rule. It operates as follows: the argument of165the minimum real intensity value of the filtered image pixels (in the same spatialposition) among the six filtered images is considered to be the pixel’s value inthe processed image [16].The proposed feature extraction scheme is inspired and based on the compet-itive orientation coding where the dominant orientations of the multi-resolution170(scales and orientations) log-Gabor coefficients are encoded. We propose to7Figure 1: Multi-spectral palmprint recognition process flow diagram.8(a)(b)(c)(d)Figure 2: ROI images of a palmprint multi-spectral image under four different spectral bands:(a) Red, (b) Green, (c) Blue and (d) NIR.9use a multi-resolution log-Gabor filter which strengthens the excellent math-ematical properties of Gabor filters aiming to make some improvements sothat the highest frequency bands would be covered by narrowly localized ori-ented filters while the set of filters would cover uniformly the Fourier domain175including the highest and lowest frequencies. Such improved characteristicsshould make the transform a more promising tool for the processing of naturalimages. To achieve this, a bank of 24 log-Gabor filters are applied on eachpalm image along four scales and six orientations in the range of [0o, 180o] (i.e.,{0, π/6, π/3, π/2, 2π/3, 5π/6}); where the indexes (s, o) of each element corre-180sponding to the lowest real intensity value of pixels (in the same spatial position)among the 24 filtered images will serve to compute its new value in the indexedimage [16].The log-Gabor filter bank frequency response is given by:LG(f0,θ0)(ρ, θ) = exp−(cid:18)[log(ρ/f0)]22σρ2(cid:19)(cid:18). exp−(cid:19)(θ − θ0)22σθ2(1)where (ρ, θ) represents the polar coordinates, f0 is the center frequency of thefilter, θ0 is the orientation angle of the filter, σρ determines the scale bandwidth185and σθ indicates the angular bandwidth.Figure 3 illustrates the filtered images along four scales and six orientationsobtained using the bank of 24 log-Gabor filters applied on a ROI image underthe Green spectral band.The winner scale and orientation indexes for each element from the filteredimages, denoted (cid:0)so(cid:1), can be computed as:(cid:19)(cid:18)so= arg mins,o(cid:0)I(x, y) ∗ lg(fs,θo)(x, y)(cid:1)(2)where I is the palm image, lg(fs,θo) is the spatial filter response at scale s and190orientation o. (x, y) represents the spatial location of each element and ∗ is theconvolution product.Therefore, the feature vector of each palm contains a five bit code of thewiner indexes at each element as listed in Table 1 allowing us to make a bitwise10Figure 3: An example of filtered images along four scales and six orientations obtained usingthe bank of 24 log-Gabor filters applied on a ROI image under Green spectral band.11representation of the corresponding 24 states (4 scales and 6 orientations) of the195multi-resolution filters indexes [16].Figure 4 shows the feature maps extracted from the ROI images in Figure2. The different gray values represent different orientation features.(a) Red(b) Green(c) Blue(d) NIRFigure 4: Feature maps extracted from the ROI images in Figure 2.3.3. Matching processThe matching process as follows: given two palm features with one stored in200the template (gallery set)and the second from the probe set, a similarity scoreis measured to check whether the features are extracted from the same palm ornot. Therefore this subsection will deal with two similarity measures used in thematching process. First, a bitwise Hamming distance is used so that our resultscan be compared against those of Zhang et al. [2]. Second, KL divergence metric205is adapted and used to further improve the recognition rates. The best scoresfor both methods were measured by taking care of reducing the translation’s12Table 1: Bit representation of the multi-resolution coding based on Gray binary code. TheGray binary code is used to code the 24 states corresponding to the scale and orientationindexes.

Hence, the test map was translated from −3to 3 both vertically and horizontally and a distance is computed between thesame template and those obtained by any translation where the minimum value210is chosen as the best and most similar one.3.3.1. Hamming distanceHamming distance is the sum of a basic XOR logic operations between thetwo maps normalized to values lying between 0 and 1 so that a distance valueof 0 represents a perfect match while a value of 1 represents a perfect difference.The normalized bitwise Hamming distance is given by:DHamm(P, Q) =(cid:80)M −1y=0(cid:80)N −1x=0i (x, y) (cid:78) Qbi (x, y))(cid:80)5i=1(P b5N M(3)where P and Q are the stored and the tested multi-resolution palmprint featuremaps, respectively. P bi and Qbi are their ith bit plane. N and M are the size ofthe palmprint image and (x, y) indicates the element’s location, respectively.2153.3.2. Kullback-Leibler divergenceThe KL divergence is a frequently used information-theoretic distance metric[27, 28].It is computed from the expected P and the observed Q intensitydistributions. In our case, these probability distributions are replaced by themulti-resolution feature maps. The KL divergence between the two maps isgiven by:dKL(P, Q) =(M −1)(N −1)(cid:88)5(cid:88)j=0i=1Pi(j) log(cid:19)(cid:18) Pi(j)Qi(j)(4)where Pi(.) and Qi(.) are the vectors of size (1 × M N ) of the stored and testedmulti-resolution palmprint feature maps P and Q, respectively.The major properties of dKL [27, 28] are: (1) its values are strictly positiveif the observed and expected maps are not equal (i.e., P (cid:54)= Q), (2) on the other220hand, the value of dKL is equal to 0 if the maps are exactly similar.In this study, a normalization of DKL is performed to allow a comparison of14two distances as follows:DKL(P, Q) =dKL(P, Q) − min(dKL(P, Q))max(dKL(P, Q)) − min(dKL(P, Q))(5)where DKL is the normalized distance. min(dKL) and max(dKL) are the mini-mum and the maximum of the non-normalized dKL, respectively.3.4. Inter-spectral and Intra-spectral analysisThe use of multi-spectral database aims to enhance the recognition rates225versus mono spectral counterpart by adding more discriminative informationcontent to the feature vectors. However, this comes at the expense of inherentlyadding more redundancy which can be counter-productive if not dealt withappropriately. A quantitative study of this inter-spectral correlation has beencarried out on the palmprint extracted feature maps. Therefore, a log-Gabor230mono-spectral feature extraction is performed and the inter-spectral distancesusing bitwise Hamming and KL distances in (3) and (5) are calculated for thesame palm.Table 2 summarizes the inter-spectral distances statistics whereas Table 3shows the intra-spectral counterparts. The majors finding from these statistical235analysis are: (1) when using DHamm the inter-spectral feature maps distanceis proportional to inter-bands color light wavelengths witch supports the theorythat each spectrum can highlight its specific feature space. (2) The most sig-nificant inter-spectral distance observed remains lower than intra-spectral onewhen using DHamm while DKL provides some inter-spectral distances that can240be close to imposter means especially for the distances between Blue and NIRand that between Green and NIR. This strengthens the analysis of highlightingunique characteristics under each spectrum.(3) The DKL distance betweenBlue and Green and between Red and NIR are very low thus demonstratingthat the correlation between them is very important, hence their fusion would245not be efficient. (4) The DKL values reflect more quantitatively different palmsthan DHamm.15Table 2: Inter-spectral band distances statistics using the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art method in [2].Spectral band MethodDistance statisticsRedGreenBlueNIRGabor+DHamm (Zhang et al.

Fusion schemesDespite the redundancy factor, a multi-spectral analysis is used to enhancethe system performances. Therefore, several fusion schemes were proposed to250achieve this goal while still keeping the added information captured from themulti-spectral analysis. Although, fusion can be performed at different levels ofthe recognition process, we have chosen to deploy two fusion methods: at thescore and the feature maps levels. In the first one, the distances are computedon each spectral band and four different schemes are developed: (i) a basic mean255of the four mono-spectral scores, (ii) a weighed by the reciprocal of Equal ErrorRate (1/EER) mean of the four mono-spectral scores [29], (iii) a basic mean ofnew normalized scores, and (iv) a weighted by (1/EER) means of new normal-ized scores already weighted by the combination of overlapping percentage asproposed in [2] to reduce correlation effects.The basic mean distance, denoted dm, is defined as:dm(P, Q) =1kk(cid:88)i=1D(MPi , MQi )(6)260i and MQwhere MPi are the palmprint feature maps of P and Q, respectively,at ith kind/band, and k is the total number of kinds. D is Hamming or KLdistance.We can also define the weighted mean distance, denoted dwm, as:dwm(P, Q) =k(cid:88)i=1wiD(MPi , MQi )(7)17wherewi =(1/(cid:80)k1EERii=1EERi)(8)The two last fused scores are computed using both equations (6) and (7) butwith a new normalized distance D(cid:48)= WoverlapD proposed in [2] (equations (5)265and (6) in [2] or their adapted scheme to the four spectral bands used to calcu-(cid:48)late d) where Woverlap is a combination of different spectral band overlappingpercentages.The second method is concerned with two fusion strategies of the extractedfeature maps fusions which are combined to eliminate redundancy resulting from270similar features which exist among different spectral bands. The first method isinspired by the technique proposed in [2] where it was observed that summingthe inter-spectral scores may make the process fail because of overlapping. Theidea was then to reduce the redundancy by eliminating all redundant featureelements having similar values over different feature maps. For example, if275we perform a Hamming distance of two feature maps belonging to the samespectral band on two different spectra, the two obtained maps would get ridof the similarities over each spectral band but fusing these maps by summingthem would sometimes lead to a misclassification due to redundancy. For this isreason, our fused scores would be better implemented using logic AN D between280the resulting XORed maps. This would ensure that two feature elements havingthe same value in different spectral bands will be zero’ed Ii.e., eliminated) afterthe XOR and will not be considered in the last fused score.Let us consider two types of feature maps MPi where i = 1, 2 for two samples{P, Q}. The fused score, denoted as D(M F )∧, would be:D(M F )∧=1M NM −1(cid:88)N −1(cid:88)x=0y=0D(MP1 (x, y), MQ1 (x, y))∧(9)D(MP2 (x, y), MQ2 (x, y))where ∧ is the AN D logical operator and D is the distance used.The second feature maps fusion method is concerned with a scheme basedon logic and arithmetic operators aiming to reduce the overlapping effect in the18fused feature maps. The idea is similar to the previous one, but a notion ofinter-spectral difference between two bands’ maps was considered in this case.Therefore, it makes sense to employ logic operators when dealing with Hammingdistance to deal with binary values. In addition, an inter-spectral distance isadded to the scheme used above. However, the arithmetic operations wereapplied for KL divergence having real values. An example of the fusion of twobands’ maps is given by equations (8) and (9) for Hamming and KL distances,respectively:D(M F )∧Hamm =15M NM −1(cid:88)N −1(cid:88)[DHamm(MP1 (x, y), MQ1 (x, y))x=0y=0∧DHamm(MP2 (x, y), MQ2 (x, y))]∧DHamm(MP1 (x, y), MP2 (x, y))where ∧ is the AN D logical operator.D(M F )∧KL =(M −1)(N −1)(cid:88)j=012[DKL(MP1 (j), MQ1 (j))+DKL(MP2 (j), MQ2 (j))](10)(11)−12[DKL(MP1 (j), MP2 (j)) + DKL(MQ1 (j), MQ2 (j))]285where M is the vector of size (1 × M N ) of the feature map. The second partof the two equations above represents the difference between spectrums.4. Experimental results, analysis and discussionIn these experiments, we have evaluated the performance of the proposedpalmprint recognition approach using the multi-spectral palmprint MS-PolyU290database described in Section 4.1. Experimental results obtained for both veri-fication and identification modes are analyzed and discussed in Section 4.2 and4.3, respectively. These results are obtained for the mono-spectral and multi-spectral cases including the use of the proposed fusion techniques described in19Section 3.5. In addition, the results are also compared against the state-of-the-295art methods in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.Section 4.4 discusses and analyzes the speed performance of our method.4.1. Multi-spectral databaseThe multi-spectral palmprint MS-PolyU database described in [30] consistsof palmprint images collected from 250 persons (195 males and 55 females)300having an age range between 20 and 60 years. The palmprint images werecollected in two separate sessions where in each one 6 images of each hand wereprovided by each subject under 4 different illuminations producing 24 samplesof each palm of an individual. The database contains 6000 images from 500different palmprints for each illumination. The two sessions were separated by305about 9 days. The four illuminations cover three spectral bands in the visiblespectrum where the peaking wavelength for Blue, Green and Red were 470nm,525nm and 660nm, respectively. The last band, NIR, is peaking at 880nm.The ROI multi-spectral database contains also the ROIs extracted from themulti-spectral palmprints database. Each ROI is a square sub image of a fixed310size: 128×128 represented in a coordinate system and extracted by the algorithmdescribed in [12].4.2. Mono-spectral verification and identificationThe inter-spectral analysis shows that each spectral band can highlight itsdiscriminative information to enhance the overall system recognition accuracy,315thus suggesting that each spectrum should have its own parameters to providethe best segregated feature maps. This section aims to investigate and determinethese parameters to obtain the lowest EER and the highest accuracy (ACC)corresponding to the threshold of EER where the False Rejection Rate (FRR)is equal to False Acceptance Rate (FAR), for the verification, the highest IR at320rank-1 for the identification on each band. We note here that EER is computedin the range of [0,1] where IR and ACC are computed in terms of ’%’.20The best combination of the four filter parameters is investigated, i.e., thecenter frequency f0, scale bandwidth σρ, the angular bandwidth σθ, and thescaling factor between the successive filters. Our choice of both bandwidths σρ325and σθ was inspired by [31] where the purpose was to be as close as possibleto the physiological knowledge of simple cortical cells which are known to beorganized in quadrature pairs of phase strengthening the complex filter values.The database was divided into a Gallery set containing the palmprints pro-vided in the first section and a Test set holding those of the second section. Each330feature map from the test set was matched with all the maps in the gallery setusing both distances in (3) and (4). A genuine match is obtained if both fea-ture maps emanate from the same palm while it will be considered as imposterif the maps are provided from two different palms. For the verification andidentification modes, the EER and the IR rank-1 are used to evaluate the sys-335tem performance. There are 18000 genuine (6 × 500 × 6) among 9000000 totalmatches. More than fifty parameters combinations were tried for each spectralband and the best results are reported in Table 4 and compared against theresults described in [2]. From the results obtained, it can be seen, first, that ourproposed method using KL distance (namely log-Gabor+DKL in the table) out-340performs the state-of-the-art method in [2] (namely Gabor+DHamm) in termsof EER for all spectral bands. Moreover, our second proposed method usingbitwise Hamming distance (namely log-Gabor+DHamm) also outperforms themethod in [2] for the three spectrums: Green, Blue and NIR. Furthermore, thismethod achieves performances slightly below than the performances of [2] for345the Red spectrum but they remain comparable. This is confirmed in terms ofACC where the best results are in the range of [97.17%, 98.41%]. The ACC re-sults were obtained at the threshold where both acceptance and rejection errorsare equal.Table 5 shows the identification results based on IR at rank-1 of the proposed350methods for each spectral band. From the results it can be noticed that themethod using bitwise Hamming distance slightly outperforms the method usingKL distance for the four spectral bands, but still remains comparable.21Table 4: Mono-spectral verification results of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-artmethod in [2] across each spectral band.MethodsCriteriaBlueGreenRedNIRGabor+DHamm [2]EER0.05200.05750.02120.0398log-Gabor+DHamm(proposed method)EERACC0.02730.02460.02260.028397.2797.5497.7497.17Threshold0.59350.56890.59210.5896log-Gabor+DKL(proposed method)EERACC0.01590.01920.02120.027498.4198.0897.8897.26Threshold0.44230.41960.41820.4111Table 5: Mono-spectral identification results of the proposed methods across each spectralband.Proposed methodsCriteriaBlue GreenRedNIRlog-Gabor+DHamm IR rank-199.2399.1099.3099.33log-Gabor+DKLIR rank-199.0398.9099.1398.93224.3. Multi-spectral verification and identificationThe fusion approaches described in Section 3.5 were analyzed in terms of355their performances to improve the recognition of the mono-spectral palmprintrecognition. Table 6 depicts the verification matching results obtained usingthe conventional fusion techniques based on the score level approach and theproposed fusion methods based on feature maps. The proposed methods, log-Gabor+DHamm and log-Gabor+DKL in the table, were compared against the360state-of-the-art method in [2] (e.g., Gabor+DHamm) for all possible combina-tions of spectral bands using the fusion methods described previously. By ana-lyzing these results, it can be noticed that, firstly, our proposed methods outper-form the method in [2] for most spectral bands combinations using the conven-tional fusion techniques based on score level (i.e. dm, dm, dwm and dwm) except(cid:48)(cid:48)365for the following spectral bands combination: Red-Blue, Red-NIR, Red-Blue-NIR; where the method in [2] surpasses the proposed methods for at least threeconventional fusion techniques. Secondly, the method ’log-Gabor+DKL’ outper-forms the method ’Gabor+DHamm’ in terms of EER in almost all cases. Thisindicates that the use of KL distance has allowed us to improve the recognition370performance when compared against the bitwise Hamming distance. Further-more, the ’log-Gabor+DKL’ method with the proposed fusion method D(M F )∧achieves the lowest EERs in the range of [0.0087, 0.0133] for all spectral bandcombinations except only for Red-NIR combination where the best EER is ob-tained for the method in [2] and also ’log-Gabor+DHamm’ method using the375380fusion metric dD(M F )∧(cid:48)m. Moreover, the use of the proposed fusion approach usingwith ’log-Gabor+DKL’ method achieves the best results in terms ofEER compared against log-Gabor+DHamm’ method. This confirms once againthat the use of KL distance is able to improve the recognition performances com-∧achieves better results in terms of EER compared to the secondpared to the use of Hamming distance. In addition, the proposed fusion methodusing D(M F )proposed fusion method using D(M F )able overlapping removal using D(M F )∧KL . This is due to the consider-∧KL which resulted in a decreaseof discriminative properties. Finally, the best result corresponding to the lowest∧Hamm or D(M F )∧Hamm or D(M F )23Table 6: Multi-spectral verification results of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-artmethod in [2] for different fusion methods across different spectral band combinations.

Compared∧385the state-of-the-art method in [2] where the best EER is 0.0121 obtained usingthe score fusion scheme to reduce overlapping, our proposed approach offerssignificantly better performance.The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for different spectral390bands are shown in Figure 5 where the best results for the verification mode isobtained using KL divergence for each spectral band and also for their fusionare illustrated. The fusion result is obtained using D(M F )corresponding to the∧combination of the four spectral bands. From the results, it can be seen thatthe fusion results outperform those obtained for each spectral band separately.395This confirms that the proposed fusion technique has allowed us to improvesignificantly the authentication performances of the mono-spectral palmprintrecognition system.Figure 5: ROC curves of the proposed method based on KL distance for each spectral bandand for the fusion of all spectral bands.We have also compared our proposed approach based on oriented multiscale2510−610−510−410−310−210−100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91ROCcurveLogarithmicFalseAcceptRateTrueAcceptRate BlueGreenRedNIRFusionlog-Gabor filters against the state-of-the-art methods. Table VII shows the best400verification results obtained versus the results from the following state-of-the-art methods: (i) palmprint verification method based on line orientation codein [3], (ii) a joint palmprint and palm-vein recognition method based on Gaborfilter in [4], (iii) multi-spectral palmprint recognition method based on Gaborfilter using rank-level fusion in [5], (iv) multi-spectral palmprint recognition405method based on Gabor filter using competitive code with score-level fusionin [2], (v) palmprint recognition method using the extended binary orientationco-occurrence vector coding [6], (vi) palmprint recognition method based ondouble half-orientation using a bank of half-Gabor filters, and (vii) palmprintrecognition method based on Gabor filter using a double-orientation code with410nonlinear matching scheme [8]. Table 7 shows the best verification results ofthese methods obtained using PolyU and MS-PolyU palmprint databases. Fromthe results obtained, it can be noticed that our method based on 2D log-Gaborwith KL distance achieves a lower EER compared against the rest of the state-of-the-art counterparts (i.e. [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]). In addition, our second method415based on 2D log-Gabor with bitwise Hamming distance outperforms the Zhang’smethod based on Gabor filter with bitwise Hamming distance in [4]. This is dueto the deployment of log-Gabor filter which integrates both scale and orientationinformation compared to a conventional Gabor filter.Furthermore, we have assessed the identification performances of the pro-420posed methods. Table 8 illustrates the identification results in terms of IR atrank-1 for different fusion techniques across different spectral band combina-tions. It can be seen that the fusion approaches have improved the identifica-tion rates at rank-1 than mono-spectral identification (see results in Table 5)with a best IR at rank-1 of 99.77% obtained for the combined spectral bands:425Blue-Green-Red-NIR, using ’log-Gabor+DKL’ method with the second fusionapproach of feature maps (i.e., D(M F )In addition, the proposed methods,∧KL ).’log-Gabor+DHamm’ and ’log-Gabor+DKL’ achieve similar identification per-formances.Figure 6 shows the Cumulative Match Curves (CMC) depicting only the26Table 7: Comparing the best verification performance of the proposed methods with thestate-of-the-art methods.MethodFeature extractionDistanceDatabaseSpectral bandJia et al.

We can see that the result of the fusionobtained using KL distance is higher than the results obtained for each spectralband using bitwise Hamming distance. Once again, this confirms that the pro-posed fusion technique has enabled us to improve significantly the identificationperformances of our proposed recognition system.4354.4. Speed performanceThe proposed method was implemented using MATLAB R2014a on a Mac-Book Pro with OS X El Capitan, Intel Core i7 CPU (2.8 GHz) and 16 GB RAM.The execution time for feature extraction and feature matching steps is listedin Table 9 and compared with the state-of-the-art method in [2]. By analyzing440the execution times (average time over 50 runs), both steps in our method (i.e.feature extraction and feature matching) have execution times slightly superiorto those in [2] but remains less than 1 second (between [0.8943,0.9279] second).Also, the feature matching step is fast compared to feature extraction step. Thissuggests that our proposed method can be integrated in an offline or online sys-445tem of multi-spectral palmprint verification. Furthermore, this execution time27Table 8: Multi-spectral identification results of the proposed methods for different fusiontechniques across different spectral bands combinations.

This suggests that it is possible to further reducethe computational time by optimizing the program code.4505. ConclusionThis paper has discussed a new multi-specral palmprint recognition approachbased on oriented multi-scale log-Gabor filters and bitwise competitive coding.We have also proposed a novel matching process that employs the bitwise Ham-ming distance and the KL divergence allowing us to capture efficiently the sim-455ilarities between palmprint feature maps generated using 2D log-Gabor filterswith bitwise competitive code. Secondly, we have proposed two fusion tech-niques of feature maps for matching step in order to to eliminate the inherentredundancy of features of neighbouring spectral bands. The experimental re-sults on MS-PolyU database have shown that the proposed approach achieves291001011021031040.9910.9920.9930.9940.9950.9960.9970.9980.99911.001LogarithmicdatabasesizeIdentificationrateCMC BlueGreenRedNIRFusionTable 9: Execution time of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art method[2].
