IntroductionP. Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 218 (2023) 1561–1570P.Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–000The emergence of new coronavirus illness has created a major health crisis around the world. Severe Acute Syn-drome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2) causes Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the World Health Organi-zation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 [24]. According to a WHO report released in August2020, around 6 million people has been succumbed to death due to COVID-19. It has morphed into an unpredictablydangerous public health emergency.The key measures to control COVID-19 are to maintain social distancing, wearing face mask, using hand sanitizerstrengthening healthcare systems and creating awareness about self-hygiene practices among people. Wearing facemask and social distancing are essential measures to keep us safe when venturing into public and it has been made asa legal COVID-19 combating behaviour by government.In this regard, a unified framework is needed to provide risk counts by recognizing face mask and identifyingsocial distancing between human beings in the public places. Object recognition algorithm includes object detectionand image classification, and it can be deployed in surveillance devices to recognize if people are following-up withgovernmental COVID-19 curb measures like appropriate social distancing in the public area and wearing facemask.The major contribution of the proposed work is given as follows:1. You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) a fastest real-time object detection algorithm that learns features by a deepconvolutional neural network has been used to identify human beings in the public area.2. Transfer Learning based Residual neural network (ResNet50v2) is used to detect and localize face mask in face.3. In the live stream, social distancing between pedestrians is detected by mapping side view to top view (i.e.) birdeye view using Top View Transformation Model (TVTM).4. A web application is developed that gives live risk analysis in public places based on the predicted valuesinclude face mask detection and interpersonal distance.The rest of this work is divided into the following sections. The Section 2 includes the literature survey. The pro-posed methodology is covered in Section 3, which includes face mask detection and interpersonal distance calculationbetween pedestrians. Section 4 assesses the proposed technique’s performance with a pre-trained model across a rangeof accuracy and loss metrics. Finally, Section 5 concludes the work with possible future directions.2. LiteratureShengcai Liao, et al [12] have proposed a new image feature extraction technique, which is Normalized PixelDifference (NPD) and a screening method is used to construct a deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset ofNDP features. They have used AdaBoost algorithm to select the distinguished features. It can handle unconstrainedface detection problems including pose, blur, illumination, occlusion, and low image resolution.In [15], deep and classical machine learning model were used to develop a hybrid model for detecting the facemask. A deep convolutional neural network, ResNet50 has been used for feature extraction whereas machine learningalgorithms like decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have used for detecting face masks. To train themodel, they have used three datasets, namely, Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD), Simulated Masked FaceDataset (SMFD), Label Face in the Wild (LFW); and produced the promising results.Chien Chuan Lin, et al [13] have proposed and executed a Top-View Transformation Model (TVTM) for imagecoordinate transformation which transforms a perspective projection image into its corresponding bird’s eye view. Theparameters used to transform the coordinates from the source image to bird’s eye view were estimated using fittingparameters searching algorithm. TVTM transformation matrix has been stored as Matrix Mapping table; loaded intothe embedded platform to transform video images.Mohammed Rahimzadeh, et al [17] have presented a modified convolutional neural network model in which thecombination of Xception and ResNet50v2 were used for classifying chest X-Ray images obtained from opensourcedataset as, normal, pneumonia, COVID-19 with 99.5% accuracy.P. Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 218 (2023) 1561–1570 P.Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–00015633In [8], face detection was done using modified Cenus Transform (CT) which is a non-parametric transform whichis similar in function to Viola real time face detection system for frontal faces in gray images. Face detection wascomputed based on local features with the modified census transform for classification. They proposed and executedfour stage classifier cascading consisting of simple linear classifiers.Shilpa Sethi, et al [22] have worked out an ensembled model of one-stage and two-stage face mask detection toachieve low inference time and high accuracy. For one-stage detection, YOLO and two-stage detection, Region-basedR-CNN were used. They have compared their model with various standard models like ResNet50, AlexNet, mobileNetand demonstrated an accuracy of 98.2%. Besides, this technique efficiently handled the occlusion in denser regions.This ensembled approach provided with a higher accuracy rate and speedy discovery rate.Sohaib Asif, et al [3] have developed a real time face mask detection system using OpenCV and machine learningalgorithms. A deep transfer learning model, MobileNetv2 was used to identify the face mask area in facial frames.This framework was tested on different moving images and static images using smart phone camera and gained thebetter training and testing accuracy respectively.Preeti Nagarth, et al [16] have depicted a deep SSDMNV2 model on Kaggle’s Medical Mask dataset, in whichSingle Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) was established on the bases of ResNet-10 architecture for detecting faces inreal time and MobileNetV2 (MNV2) was used to predict whether the person is wearing mask or not. SSD was efficientin detecting multiple objects on an image using merely a single shot multibox. This method provided a result of 93%accuracy.Yuzhen Chen, et al [6] have designed a face mask detection model on face mask’s micro photos. Gray LevelOccurrence Matrices (GLCMs) technique was used for feature extraction and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifierwas used to classify three level detection system that includes Type I: Normal use (day 0 to 1: Face mask usedsecurely), Type II: Early Warning (day 2 to 3: Close to the end of service) and Type III: Not recommended (day 4 to5: Better to change new one).Mohemed Loey, et al [14] have annotated and localized the medical face mask objects in the live images. Featureswere extracted using ResNet-50, a deep transfer learning model and medical face masks were detected using YOLOv2.Intersection over Union (IoU) was used to improve object detection process and to estimate the best number of targetregions.Priyanka Rastogi, et al. [18] have developed a “LeuFeatx” - VGG16 adapted fine-tuned feature extractor model forthe staunch classification of leukocytes for leukemia diagnosis. This model was able to extract noteworthy leukocytefeatures using microscopic single-cell leukocyte images. LeuFeatx deep features were used to train multiclass classi-fiers to gain improved precision and sensitivity for seven leukocyte subtypes. Additionally, a binary classification wasperformed on the ALL_IDB2 dataset for disease prediction and yielded a 96.15% accuracy rate. In [19], the authoralso have addressed reasoning-based deep learning algorithms to handle the problems in medical imaging data. Theyhave presented the difficulties of performing traditional medical image analysis and examined some of the most recentstudies on big data platforms and deep learning for medical image analysis.A deep learning model for the early identification and prediction of chronic kidney disease has been presentedby Vijendra Singh et al. [21]. (CKD). The most crucial features in the dataset were chosen using Recursive FeatureElimination (RFE). When compared to machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifier, the deep neural modeloutperformed them. These studies show that neural network is a generative method and can be applied on healthcareapplications. The proposed method uses deep learning algorithms for detecting human beings with face mask in publicplaces to calculate live COVID-19 risk analysis.3. MotivationGlobally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life and presents an unprecedented threatto public health, food systems, and the workplace. Millions of people may have to live in extreme poverty as aresult of the pandemic’s catastrophic effects on society and the economy. Food security, public health, and labourissues—in particular, the health and safety of workers—converge in the COVID-19 problem. To address these kind ofcrisis, safety guidelines in workplaces like healthcare units should be followed strictly across all government and non-governmental organizations across the globe. In this real time life wrecking scenario, an immediate and holistic action 1564 4P.Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–000P. Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 218 (2023) 1561–1570Fig. 1. Architecture of a proposed unified framework for monitoring Social Distancing and Face Mask Wearingthat ensures protection of lives and livelihood universally is inevitable. Hence this study finds this as the motivationand contributes to the society positively.The world have not seen such pandemic until 2019. As a subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deeplearning techniques are widely used in object detection and classification (like face detection, face mask detection).The majority of COVID-19 research papers were only concerned with face mask detection. For the study of risk inCOVID-19, face mask detection and interpersonal distance are coupled in this work. Additionally, a web applicationis developed that delivers real-time risk analysis based on interpersonal distance and face mask.4. Materials and MethodsA unified framework is developed for an automatic detection of live risk analysis in public places based on facemask detection and interpersonal distance between the people. The proposed model is given in the Fig.1 and describedas follows:4.1. Constructing Human Detection Model using YOLOv3The fastest real-time object detection algorithm is YOLOv3, which uses a deep convolutional neural network tolearn features [20]. There are 24 convolution layers, 4 max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers in thisclassic model. This architecture takes an image as input and resizes it to 608x608 by padding it, whilst keeping thesame aspect ratio. The CNN network receives this resized image to detect the human beings. The YOLOv3 model hasbeen trained using the ImageNet-1000 dataset to recognize the human in a video frame[7]. The Imagenet-1000 datasethas a total of 1.2 million images, including the class for humans (persons).4.2. Constructing Face Mask Detection Model using ResNet50v2ResNet50 is a deep residual neural network that won first place in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual RecognitionChallenge 2015 (ILSVRC2015) [9]. It is used for image categorization on ImageNet. This model is well-suited toimage identification applications, and it performs admirably with a low error rate. ResNet solves the vanishing gradientproblem by integrating different sized convolution filters and thereby lowering the deep architecture’s training time.P. Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 218 (2023) 1561–1570 P.Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–00015655Fig. 2. A Residual Block in ResNet50v2Integrating identity shortcut connections, which essentially skip the training of one or more layers by forming aresidual block, can shorten the training time in ResNet50.→A residual block in ResNet50v2 is depicted in Fig. 2. In this deep residual network, instead of learning a directy with a function H(x), the residual function for the network is defined as H(x) = F(x) - x, which canmapping of xbe expressed into H(x) = F(x) + x ( F(x) - the stacked non-linear layers and x denotes the identity function i.e. input(x)= output(x) ). In traditional neural networks, consecutive intermediate layers are linked to each other, whereas, in theResNet50 framework, connections made between residual blocks. These connections will preserve the informationgained during training and help to speed up the training time of the model by increasing the capacity of the deepnetworks.ResNet50v2 is a modified version of ResNet50 and it performs better than ResNet50 and ResNet101 on the Ima-geNet dataset, since, in ResNet50v2, propagation formulation of the connections between blocks is modified [2]. Thenetwork takes an image input size of 224*224 and is passed into the CNN network for detecting masked faces. Totrain this model, Kaggle dataset and Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD) [14] has been used. The images inthe dataset are classified into two classes: with mask and without mask; there are total 4095 images in the dataset inwhich 2165 images are with mask and 1930 images are without mask. The resolution of the images is 608x608. Table1 illustrates the architecture of the pre-trained ResNet50v2 model used in this work [17].4.3. Detecting Human Beings in Video FramesHuman being detection model has been constructed using YOLOv3 on ImageNet-1000 dataset and is used to detectand localize human beings in the video frames. Once the human beings are localized then the coordinates are marked.These marked regions are used as input for face mask detection. This array of coordinates helps to localize face andcheck for face masks faster, since the area of search is much reduced to achieve good accuracy.4.4. Detecting Face Mask in HumansOnce the citizenry is detected within the video frames, the ResNet50v2 algorithm has been employed to detectwhether the persons have worn mask. The predicted value helps in categorizing persons into masked class and non- 1566 6P.

Mask Impact Factor (MIF) is calculated based on the predicted value. Value 0 is assigned to MIF ifnone of the persons are not wearing mask whereas any integer value represents the masked persons. MIF value willbe normalized to detection percentage.4.5. Social Distancing CalculationOnce the human beings are detected using YOLOv3, then the detected pedestrians are mapped from side viewto top view (i.e.) bird eye view using Top View Transformation Model (TVTM) [13]. In TVTM, the original imagecoordinates (x, y) are transformed into top view coordinates (x*, y*) using the following equations.x∗ = Hx sin θ + f cos θy cos θ + f sin θ−; y∗ = Hx sin θ + f cos θy cos θ + f sin θ+ d; y∗ = Hx∗ = H+ 1−y sin θ + f cos θy cos θ + f sin θ−y sin θ + f cos θy cos θ + f sin θ−+ d(1)(2)where (x, y) are the original image coordinates, and (x*, y*) are the destination image coordinates, H is the distancebetween the camera and ground, f is the focal length of the camera, and θ is the camera tilt angle.The transformed component values of x* and y* may be less than or equal to zero. If the transformed componentvalues of x* and y* are greater than zero, the constant d, the coordinate point is defined on the original source imagethat has been mapped into the coordinate point in the destination image.4.6. Scaling and Intersection DetectionThe risk prone distance between the individuals is designated as 1.5m radius by scaling up the distance connectingtwo individuals. Pedestrians likely to spread COVID-19 can be detected based on intersection values between theindividuals and MIF values calculated from face mask detection, and they can be classified into low, medium, andhigh-risk prone individuals.where,d =H(sin θ+ f cos θ)f sin θcos θ−(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:25)P.Kaviya et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–000P.

Risk AnalysisFig. 3 represents how the area of intersection is calculated between the pedestrians. Equation (3) is used to find thearea of intersection which calculates the proximity of intersection between two humans.where,Aintersection = r21cos−1d1r1 (cid:30)(cid:31)d1−r21 −(cid:29)1 + r2d22cos−1d2r2 (cid:30)(cid:31)d2−(cid:29)r22 −d22(3)d1 = r21−r22+d22dandd2 = dd1 = r22−r21+d22d−Fig. 4 provides the risk analysis among the individuals from the results of area of intersection. Once a personis found to possess high intersection and without mask, then he/she is assigned to high-risk category. By the sameway, the distance calculations can be done faster for multiple objects and can be classified instantly. Thereby, livemonitoring data of legalized COVID-19 appropriate behaviour follow-up among common people can be obtainedfrom each frame within fraction of seconds. 1568 8P.

Performance EvaluationAll the experimental trails have been conducted on Open CV and TensorFlow environment with GTX 1080 GPUenabled computer with an i5 processor and 16GB RAM. The experimental parameters of the proposed work is spec-ified as follows: The proposed framework uses the transfer learning approach for detecting facemask in humans. Fordetecting human in the video frame, a transformed CNN network is used with 24 convolution layers, 4 max-poolinglayers, and two fully connected layers. To detect face mask in the detected human, transformed ResNet50v2 model isused with the parameters given in the Table 1.In public places, real time CCTV cameras are fixed in various locations to capture videos 24/7 and stored inMongoDB with timestamps. These videos are stored along with camera properties like height from the ground, angleof inclination, and lamination. These video frames are passed as an input to pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect andlocalize human beings. Once human beings are detected, ResNet50v2 model is used to determine whether the personsare masked or not. Also, social distancing among the pedestrians is calculated using TVTM.A web application has been developed that provides live risk analysis in public places based on the predicted valueslike mask impact factor (MIF) and interpersonal distance. This helps the proctor to know the high prone zones to takenecessary preventive ventures in future. By using this model anyone can monitor the environment without employinga human to monitor and calculate live risks.P.

ConclusionThis work has been a successful attempt to design a consensus configuration model to prevent the spread ofCOVID19 which utilizes a digital camera that explores the risk of covid 19 transmission through the discovery offace masked persons and calculating the social distance between persons. This model has made use of a fast objectdetection algorithm, YOLOv3, to capture images of humans on the open space; aftermath of which, those images wereused by the algorithm ResNet50V2, to examine if the persons are wearing mask or not. The TVTM model has beenused to calculate the social gap between any two people on the moving image. This research could be a cost effectiveand radical web application that can report on the risk of “disease spreading” instantly and this application can begeneralized to any such helpless pandemic situation in future. To prove its effectiveness, the accuracy of the resultsobtained from the evaluation is 97.66%, the precision is 97.84% and the F1 score is 97.92%. The proposed transferlearning technique to detect facemask is performed better than other recent works. Also, the existing detection modelstudies till date examines and works on “measuring social gap between the pedestrians” separately and the data about“human face mask wearing” separately. At this point, this work is an eye-opener in the context that it is a completemodel that combines and explores the above mentioned two parameters altogether in a single portable device. Withthis model, the risk of future disease warning can be quickly and instantly detected without human workload. 1570 10ReferencesP.
