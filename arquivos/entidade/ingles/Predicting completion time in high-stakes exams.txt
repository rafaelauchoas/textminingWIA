While a certain amount of stress motivates the individual and improves performance, too muchstress will have the contrary effect. Stress has therefore a fundamental role on student performance. Itshould be the educational organizations’ mission to understand the underlying mechanisms that leadto performance anxiety and provide their students with the best coping tools and strategies. In thepresent study we analyze student behavior during e-assessment in terms of mouse dynamics. Two majorbehavioral patterns can be identified, based on ten features that quantify the performance of the student’sinteraction with the computer: (1) students who are able to sustain performance during the exam and (2)students whose performance varies significantly. Data shows that the behavior of each student duringthe exam correlates strongly with the time it takes the student to complete it. Several classifiers weretrained that predict the completion time of each exam based on the students’ interaction patterns. Two ofthem do it with an average error of around twelve minutes. Results show that there are still mechanismsthat can be explored to better understand the complex relationship between stress, performance andhuman behavior, that can be used for the implementation of better stress detection, monitoring andcoping strategies.© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionHigher education is often stressful, especially in courses con-sidered more challenging or demanding such as Medicine in whichstudent stress levels are higher than those of other fields [1].Stressors such as the overwhelming burden of information, theuncertainty about the future or dealing with high expectations puta constant pressure on the student [2].Each student tends to develop his/her own coping strategies,some counterproductive (e.g. drugs, alcohol, eating) others con-structive (e.g. regular exercise, meditation). Indeed, coping stylesare related not only to student performance but also to mentalhealth outcomes, especially in high-achieving students. Further-more, coping styles (specifically, anger and positive appraisal)moderate the influence of stress on global life satisfaction andinternalizing symptoms of psychopathology [3].* Corresponding author at: CIICESI, ESTG, Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portu-gal.E-mail addresses: dcarneiro@di.uminho.pt (D.

All rights reserved.The educational organization plays an essential role in thismatter: that of providing the student community with viable solu-tions for coping with stress (e.g. guidance, personalized support).However, and despite the existence of successful stress copinginitiatives [4], it is still necessary to determine which students needthis support as they do not always come forward on their owninitiative.The identification of these students may not always be easy aspeople often tend to disguise the consequences of stress. Moreoverthe professor, who might be in the best position to do so, is oftendealing with hundreds of students, making this a rather difficulttask to achieve.In this paper we propose an approach to assess the effectsof stress on students during high-stakes exams, which constituteparticular stressful moments in the academic career. Specifically,we look at behavioral biometrics [5] and mouse dynamics [6]to develop a non-intrusive method to assess the performance ofstudents while interacting with the computer.The goal is to analyze how performance varies during high-stakes exams for each individual student, eventually distinguishingbetween students who are able to maintain a steady performanceand students whose performance varies significantly during the550D. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559duration of the exam. The hypothesis is that each student may beaffected differently by stress and that this approach is a valid onefor measuring such differences. Indeed, and as detailed in Section 2,stress affects many different aspects of an individual, includingphysical and behavioral. It is therefore valid to accept that it mightaffect the way a student interacts with the mouse during a stressfulevent such as an exam.In this paper we detail the features extracted from the student’sinteraction with the computer, which characterize the student’sperformance. These data are collected and processed in real-time,from each student, allowing to continuously assess the perfor-mance of each student throughout the exam. Moreover, resultsshow that performance is related to exam completion time. Withthe collected data we train four different classifiers, two of whichable to predict exam completion time for each student, based onthe interaction patterns with an error of approximately 12 min.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieflyaddresses stress and its effects on the individual at different levels.Section 3 details the population that participated in the study,the feature extraction process and the dataset used. Afterwards,Section 4 details the methodology followed for analyzing the dataand training the classifier, and the main results. Finally, Section 5discusses the significance of the main findings and presents theconclusions.2. Stress and its effectsIn nowadays society, stress and its effects at an organizationaland individual level have become a significant problem [7]. Whilestress has undeniable positive effects [8], it is the negative effectsthat become especially known to society, due to the potentialseverity of their consequences.Stress and related concepts can be traced as far back as writtenscience and medicine [9]. In modern science, the study of thephysiological effects of stress in the 50’s, resulted in the devel-opment of a group of reliable physiological indicators, that canbe easily acquired through sensors (e.g. skin conductivity, bodytemperature, heart rate) to assess stress level. Later, in the 70’s,research was directed towards the somatic disorders that resultfrom biologic aspects [10].Simultaneously, Hans Selye, an Austrian–Canadian endocrinol-ogist, provided an accurate and simultaneously accessible defini-tion of stress [11] as a non-specific response of the body to externaldemands. These demands (the load or stimulus that triggereda response) are denominated stressors while the internal bodychanges that they produce constitute the actual stress response.Selye was also the first to document the chemical and hormonalchanges that occur in the body due to stress.Responses to stress are coordinated by a so-called stress systemand take place when a stressor of any kind exceeds a given thresh-old. Given that this threshold may vary from person to person (asit depends on individual differences) the study of stress and itscauses/effects becomes complex. The composition of this stresssystem is known to include as main components the corticotropin-releasing hormone and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomicsystems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary–adrenal axis,and the limbs of the autonomic system [9].The effects of stress on the nervous system of the individualat an internal level have thus been studied for several decades. Insynthesis, the activation of the stress system leads to peripheralchanges that improve the ability of the organism to adjust home-ostasis and increase its chances for survival.However, in recent years, attention has been drawn to theeffects of stress at an external level. Indeed, when observed ex-ternally, stress results in many changes on the individual, namelyon behavior, physical response or cognitive performance (e.g. con-centration, short-term memory, fine motor control, reasoning),through different physiological mechanisms [12].This led to the development of non-intrusive systems for stressdetection that are based on the individual’s behavior. Many differ-ent approaches have been proposed. In [13] the authors explore thepossibility of detecting cognitive and physical stress by monitoringkeyboard interactions with the eventual goal of detecting acute orgradual changes in cognitive and physical function. The researchersanalyze keystroke and linguistic features of spontaneously gen-erated text, showing that it is possible to classify cognitive andphysical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions.Similar approaches exist that use different modalities of ourbehavior to classify stress, including mouse dynamics, keyboarddynamics and movement patterns [14]. Finally, There is also workon the effect of stress on the interaction with touch screens inmobile devices, showing that it is possible to distinguish be-tween two states of stress from temporal and intensity features oftouches [15].An up-to-date view of stress may thus look at it as a physic-physiologic arousal response occurring in the body as result ofstimuli. It should also be added that these stimuli only becomestressors by virtue of the cognitive interpretation of the individual,i.e., the effects of stressors depend on the individual. Regardlessof inter-individual differences, it is nowadays clear that the effectsof stress can be measured in novel ways, namely those based onHuman–Computer Interaction.Over the last years there has also been a growing interest instudying and measuring stress and its effects in the workplaceand similar milieus. In the beginning, interest was mostly fromthe field of occupational health, i.e., studying the effects of peopleworking with new technological tools and the accompanying newstressors (e.g. inadequate employee training to use new technol-ogy, monotonous tasks, electronic performance monitoring) [16].The interest was thus more on identifying and understandingtechnology-related job stressors rather than on trying to quantifystress level.However, the interest of researchers soon shifted to the field ofHuman–Computer Interaction and to the effects of stress, affectivestates, fatigue and other factors on the individual’s interactionpatterns with the technological devices. As when considering in-teractions between people, interactions between people and tech-nological devices also have two channels: one transmits explicitmessages (i.e. the actions we perform on the computer) while theother transmits implicit messages (i.e. how we do it). As researchhas been demonstrating, we perform actions differently accordingto our state. The inclusion of this kind of information in next-generation Human–Computer Interaction designs is seen by manyexperts in the field as the path to produce true human-aware andsystems, that are able to understand and adapt to the user’s stateat each moment [17].Many different approaches have been followed in this regard,with varying goals. In [18], the authors propose a system basedon face analysis and voice recognition to analyze the emotions ofcomputer users. These two methods are actually very common inthis field [19], either for stress analysis or for fatigue or emotionclassification, along with posture and gaze analysis [20]. Othersensors have also been used by researchers, including Blood Vol-ume Pulse, Galvanic Skin Response, Skin or Facial Temperature andPupil Diameter, all of which producing features that are stronglycorrelated to stress level or emotional arousal [21,22].The main drawback with these approaches, that are generallyvery precise and are also nowadays very common, is that theyrely on sensors that may be intrusive since they must be placedon the body of the individuals. Few research works exist thatacquire relevant data in a non-intrusive way. One of the very fewD. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559551is the work of [23], in which the authors use a pressure sensitivekeyboard and a capacitive mouse to measure user stress level.In the case of this work, one of the fundamental requirementsis that the routines of the students while doing the computer-based exam are not disturbed by the data collection process as,given the potential stressful nature of the exam, any disturbancemay have negative consequences on the outcome. Moreover, theuse of additional hardware might significantly increase the cost ofthe data collection process, leading to a probable decrease in thepopulation to control costs. The approach followed in this paperthus relies solely on Mouse Dynamics, in an attempt to put forwarda completely non-intrusive method for assessing stress in Human–Computer Interaction.3. Material and methodsThe purpose of this work is to assess the influence of stresson student behavior during high-stakes exams in the sense thatthese are exams with important life-changing consequences forthe test taker. In the case of the selected population (medicalstudents), passing has significant benefits (e.g. advancing on theiracademic career or attaining a diploma) while failing has importantdisadvantages (e.g. delaying or jeopardizing the student’s aspira-tions). This specific population (medical students) was selected toparticipate in this study given these characteristics as they undergosome of the most rigorous and intense (and consequently stressful)learning and assessment processes there are.The study took place in the School of Medicine of the Univer-sity of Minho, where exams take place at the computer. In thiskind of exams, when students enter the room, they are indicatedtheir computer. Each computer has a keyboard, a mouse and ascreen. At the designated time they log in the exam platformusing their personal credentials and the exam begins. During theexam, which consists mostly of single-best-answer multiple choicequestions [24], students use mostly the mouse as an interactionmeans. When the exam ends, students are allowed to leave theroom.The collection of the necessary data is completely transparentfrom the point of view of the student, i.e., their participation inthe study has no effect whatsoever on their routine as all therelevant data is collected in a transparent manner. The populationthat participated in the study as well as the characteristics of thefour exams in which data was collected is detailed in Section 3.1.Section 3.2 details the interaction features that are transparentlyextracted from the use of the mouse by the students. Finally,Section 3.3 describes the methodology followed as well as thedataset used.3.1. PopulationData was collected in four different exams, that took place indifferent dates, comprising a total of 363 students. Of these, datafrom 66 students that left the exam in the initial 15 min, whowere not actually trying to complete the exam, were discarded. Thedataset thus includes data from 297 participants out of the initial363 students (81.82%). Table 1 details the main characteristicsof each of the four exams. Fig. 1 complements this informationgraphically by depicting the distribution of the completion time ofeach exam.It is important to clarify that in this work, the duration ofthe exam depicts the completion time, i.e., the time it takes eachstudent to complete the exam as there is no fixed duration for eachexam: each student is free to manage her/his time at will.Fig. 1. Exam completion time: distribution of the duration of each exam, in minutes,before removing data from exams shorter than 15 min.3.2. Feature extractionAll the actions of each student during the exam are loggedelectronically (e.g. moving to a new question, answering a ques-tion, changing a previous answer). Moreover, lower-level data isalso recorded that describes the interaction of the students withthe computer peripherals. Specifically, the following events arerecorded:• MOV, timestamp, posX, posYAn event describing the movement of the mouse, in a giventime, to coordinates (posX, posY) in the screen;• MOUSE_DOWN, timestamp, [Left–Right], posX, posYThis event describes the first half of a click (when the mousebutton is pressed down), in a given moment. It also describeswhich of the buttons was pressed (left or right) and theposition of the mouse in that instant;• MOUSE_UP, timestamp, [Left–Right], posX, posYAn event similar to the previous one but describing thesecond part of the click, when the mouse button is released;• MOUSE_WHEEL, timestamp, difThis event describes a mouse wheel scroll of amount dif, ata given time;• KEY_DOWN, timestamp, keyIdentifies a given key from the keyboard being presseddown, at a given time;• KEY_UP, timestamp, keyDescribes the release of a given key from the keyboard, at agiven time.The following example depicts a brief log that starts with somemouse movement (first two lines), contains a click with a little drag(lines 3–5) and ends with some more movement (last two lines).MOV, 635296941683402953, 451, 195MOV, 635296941684123025, 451, 197MOUSE_DOWN, 635296941684443057, Left, 451, 199MOV, 635296941685273140, 452, 200MOUSE_UP, 635296941685283141, Left, 452, 200MOV, 635296941685723185, 452, 203MOV, 635296941685803193, 454, 205On the one hand, this kind of logs allows to fully reconstructthe actions of each student, providing insights to when and wereinteractions occur. On the other hand, this information can be usedto extract features that quantify the performance of the student’sinteraction with the computer. The process of extracting thesefeatures is detailed in [25].552D.

Then, it ismeasured the distance actually traveled by the mouse by summingthe distance between each two consecutive MOUSE_MV events.Let us assume two vectors posx and posy, of size n, holding thecoordinates of the consecutive MOUSE_MV events between mupand mdo.

The sum of the distances between each position and thestraight line defined by the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by(2), in which ptLineDist returns the distance between the specifiedpoint and the closest point on the infinitely-extended line definedby (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559553the parabola. Finally, the coefficient c controls the height of theparabola where it intercepts the y-axis.In the context of this study, a larger magnitude of a indicatesa larger variation of performance throughout the exam while asmaller one indicates that the performance was more constant.Moreover, a positive value of a indicates that the performancedrops at the beginning of the exam and then improves, and vice-versa.Fig. 5 depicts a least-squares fit of a quadratic curve to thedata depicted in Fig. 4. It makes the temporal evolution of per-formance (improving and then degrading) more clearly visible.In this specific case, the corresponding quadratic functions aref (x) = 2.44 ∗ 10−11x2 − 70.45x + 5.09 ∗ 1013 (Fig. 5, left) andf (x) = −7.88 ∗ 10−14x2 − 0.23x − 1.64 ∗ 1011 (Fig. 5, right).Given the importance of the coefficient a in shaping the tempo-ral evolution of performance, this study focuses on this coefficient.Moreover, given that we are interested in distinguishing betweenstudents who are able to maintain a steady performance andstudents whose performance varies significantly, we consider itsmodulus |a|.Consequently, the dataset used in this study has the follow-ing structure: one attribute identifying the student/exam, one at-tribute that quantifies the completion time (in minutes) of thatexam for that student and ten more attributes, each one quanti-fying the modulus of the coefficient a of the quadratic functionof each of the features described in Section 3.2. The dataset isthus composed of twelve columns and 297 instances, one for eachparticipating student.

Methodology and resultsThe analysis of the collected data started with a visual analysis.Fig. 6 depicts the scatter diagrams of the modulus of the coefficienta of the quadratic functions that fit each feature against the com-pletion time of the exams. Some interesting preliminary insightsare revealed. Specifically, the scatter diagrams show that longercompletion times seem to be associated to smaller magnitudes of|a|. In practical terms, this means that students who stay longer atthe exams are also those whose performance varies less during theexam.These differences are visible when comparing graphically thevariation of performance of students who spent different timesto complete the same exam. As an example, Fig. 7 shows theevolution of click duration for four different students taking thesame exam. The students depicted in the top row took more than2 h to complete the exam. The values of the coefficient a are,respectively, −0.0003, −0.001 and −0.002. On the other hand, thestudents in the lower row completed the exam in around 30 min.The values of the coefficient a in this case are, respectively, 0.056,0.088 and −0.81.Indeed, this inverse relationship between the two variablesis confirmed by the figures detailed in Table 2, that shows thecorrelation between the completion time of each exam (A–D)and the magnitude of |a| in each feature. A negative correlationbetween the variables exists in all features/exams, with valuesranging between −0.69 and −0.35 which, considering that it isa biological phenomena being studied, constitute very interestingvalues.Fig. 3. (a) A series of MOV events, between two consecutive clicks of the mouse. Thedifference between the shortest distance (sdist) and distance actually traveled bythe mouse (rdist) is depicted. (b) The real distance traveled by the mouse betweeneach two consecutive clicks is given by summing the distances between each twoconsecutive MOV events.us also assume two vectors posx and posy, of size n, holdingthe coordinates of the consecutive MOUSE_MOV events betweenmup and mdo. The velocity between the two clicks is given byr_dist/(time2 − time1), in which r_dist represents the distancetraveled by the mouse and is given by Eq. (3).Time Between Clicks (TBC)Units - millisecondsThe timespan between two consecutive MOUSE_UP and MOUSE_DOWN events, i.e., how long did it took the individual to performanother click.These features quantify the performance of the students’ interac-tion with the computer. As an example, longer clicks as well asmore excessive distance traveled by the mouse reveal a decreasingperformance.For each student, the collected data is aggregated and summa-rized at 5-min intervals. The average value of the feature in theinterval is used.Fig. 4 depicts the type of information that these features pro-vide. It shows the evolution of the performance of a specific studentduring an exam through two features: Click Duration and MouseVelocity. The duration of each click decreases until roughly themiddle of the exam and then increases up to a global maximum.The velocity of the mouse increases until approximately the samepoint in time and then it starts decreasing. Both features point outan initial improvement of performance (faster clicks and increasingmouse velocity), followed by a degrading.Fig. 4 actually reveals a classical effect of stress: performancetends to improve for some time after the beginning of the stressorstimulus (eustress), with a drop off in performance after some timeperforming above average (distress) [26].These features allow for an individualized view on how stressaffects each particular student, potentially devising each one’sbreaking points, behavior or overall performance under stress.3.3. DatasetIn order to analyze the students’ behavior throughout the examand, more precisely, the evolution of students’ performance, weperformed a least-squares fit to a quadratic curve of each stu-dent/feature. The hypothesis is that the way the performance of thestudent changes through the exam, and consequently the shape ofthe quadratic curve, may be related to certain characteristics of thestudent.A univariate quadratic function can be represented in the stan-dard form as f (x) = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b and c represent thecoefficients. The coefficient a controls the degree of curvature ofthe graph: a larger magnitude of a gives the graph a more closed(sharply curved) appearance. Moreover, a positive value of a resultsin an parabola open upwards, and vice-versa. The coefficients band a together control the location of the axis of symmetry of554D.

To this end, fourdifferent classifiers were used: Random Forests, Neural Networks,Linear Regression and Gaussian Process.Random Forest predictors use an ensemble of decision treesto predict the intended value. Each decision tree is trained on arandom subset of the training set and only uses a random subsetof the features. A Neural Network consists of several layers ofcomputing neurons, with information being processed in eachlayer and passed on from the input to the output layer. The NeuralNetwork is trained to minimize a loss function on the training setusing gradient descent. The Linear Regression predicts a numericaloutput using a linear combination of numerical features. The com-bination of these numerical features is also obtained by minimizinga loss function. Finally, the Gaussian Process method assumes thatthe function to be modeled has been generated from a Gaussianprocess, defined by a so-called covariance function. In the trainingphase, the method estimates the parameters of this covariancefunction and is then conditioned on the training data and used toinfer the value of a new example using a Bayesian inference.Each of these algorithms were used to train a different classifierfor each subset of features of the original dataset. Since there wereten features in the dataset, 1023 classifiers were trained for eachof the four algorithms. This corresponds to the number of subsetsin a set of size 10 ( 210) excluding the empty subset.Random forest predictors were composed by 200 trees, a leafsize of 5 and a variable sample size of 2. Neural Networks wereconfigured with two hidden layers and 15 nodes in each layer.Concerning the numerical covariance function of the GaussianProcess, the Squared Exponential function was used.Given the size of the dataset, the holdout method was employedto build the training and testing samples [27]. This method sug-gests that the available data should be randomly split into twodisjoint subsets for a single train-test experiment. One group isused for the task of training while the other is held for the taskof testing. In this specific work, the training set holds two thirds ofthe data while the test set holds the remaining third.D. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559555Fig. 6. Exam completion times vs. performance variation: scatter diagrams plotting the modulus of the coefficient a of the quadratic functions that fit each feature againstthe completion time of the exams.One limitation of this method is that, since the results are sodependent on the choice of the training/testing set of samples,they will be misleading in the event of an unfortunate division. Forinstance, it might be too easy/difficult to classify certain examplesof data in the testing set, leading to biased results.In order to avoid this drawback, this process of dividing thedataset and training a classifier was repeated twenty times for eachsubset of features and each classifier, and its results averaged. Themeasure of fit of each of the predictors is thus the average error ofthe prediction (in minutes) over the twenty rounds.Fig. 8 illustrates how the average error of the predictors varieswith the different subsets of features considered. The first subsetsinclude a single feature each. As the number of the subset grows,the number of features considered also grows until all ten featuresare considered in the last subset. Fig. 8 depicts how the averageerror decreases from around 20 min when only one feature is con-sidered to around 14 min when an increased number of featuresare considered.Table 3 shows the results of each predictor when using allfeatures, in terms of the average, standard deviation, minimum andmaximum value of error (in minutes).Tables 4–7 present some more details about these results.

Thetop average performance is achieved by the subset of features {3,4, 5, 6, 8, 10} using Random Forests and by the subset {3, 4, 7, 9, 10}using Neural Networks, with an average error of 12.7 and 12.2 min,respectively, over the 20 runs. In both algorithms, minimum errorsof 10–11 min occur. The low magnitude of the standard deviation(<1 minute in both algorithms) in all the predictors shows theconsistency of each one over the 20 rounds. The other two algo-rithms are left out of this more detailed analysis as they performsignificantly worse.Tables 6 and 7 detail the five subsets with the worst perfor-mance for the Random Forests and Neural Networks algorithms,respectively, all of which composed by a single feature. In thesesubsets, the error averages 22 min. Three of the five features of eachgroup are common for both algorithms.556D. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559Fig. 7.

The results are, as expected, better than on the test set,as depicted in Table 8.5. Discussion and conclusionStress is a complex phenomena, with effects at many differentlevels on the individual. It is our belief that some of these effectsare still to be discovered, especially in cases in which they areD. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559557Fig. 9.

That is thecase of the approach studied in this work.It is a known fact that, among others, stress affects our behav-ior. In the past, an individual’s behavior would be characterizedmostly in terms of social behavior (e.g. social withdrawal, mood,irritability, sadness/depression) or physical behavior (e.g. bodylanguage, muscle tension or pain). In recent years, our interactionwith technological devices became another potential source of in-formation to characterize our state or our behavior, with the addedadvantage that data can be collected continuously, autonomously,and transparently.In this paper we focus on such an approach. Specifically, welook at mouse dynamics to characterize user behavior during high-stakes exams. One important aspect worth highlighting, especiallyconcerning this domain of application, is the relationship betweenthe features used and performance. Indeed, all the features can beused to quantify the performance of the student’s interaction withthe computer: longer clicks or larger distances traveled with themouse to complete the same task are signs of lower performance.Given that there are differences in the average values of perfor-mance between students, one future research direction will be to558D. Carneiro et al. / Future Generation Computer Systems 92 (2019) 549–559assess if this measure of performance correlates with academicperformance.Moreover, and as the data points out, it is also interesting tonote that there are two main groups of students in what concernsbehavior during an exam.The first group is constituted by those students who take longerto complete the exam. Indeed, there are students who take morethan 2 h to do so. Interestingly enough, these are also the studentswho maintain a more steady performance throughout the exam.Then, there is the group of students who complete the sameexam significantly faster, in as low as 30 min. When comparing thisgroup with the previous one, the main difference is that these stu-dents show a more marked variation of performance throughoutthe exam. Moreover, in this group there are students who improveperformance until roughly the middle of the exam and then startdegrading, and vice-versa. See for example Fig. 7(g): the studentstarts the exam with clicks of around 80 ms, the duration thenincreases until reaching a maximum of 120 ms (an increase of 40%),and at the end of the exam it decreases back to around 80 ms.And all this happens in the span of 35 min, which is this student’scompletion time for this exam. The mechanisms underlying thisbehavior are still to be explored. Namely, what makes this studentbehave like this and students (e) and (f) in Fig. 7 behave exactly theopposite (i.e. improving performance and then degrading)? Is thisrelated to some characteristic of the student such as stress copingstrategies or the way they perceive stress? This is something thatwill be pursued in the future.While many new questions are raised by this research work,some concrete practical advances are also put forward. First of all,it is shown that the proposed approach can effectively be used tocharacterize the behavior of students in a non-intrusive way, inreal time. It can collect data in a distributed way, from dozens orhundreds of students simultaneously without interfering with theroutine of the exam.Secondly, a random decision forest and a neural network topredict exam completion time were trained and evaluated. Theencouraging results show, on the one hand, the significance andconsistency of the behaviors observed. On the other hand, theyopen the door to a possibility not yet explored, to the extentof our knowledge: the one of predicting, in real-time, the examcompletion time. Indeed, this may constitute a valuable tool for aprofessor to assess the state of the students while taking an exam,eventually intervening to calm them if necessary and possible.If intervening is not possible, which is common in high-stakesexams, the professor still has a valuable tool to assess the magni-tude of the effects of this stressful experience on the students. Thisis fundamental, especially when the educational organization as-sumes the mission of providing the students with the best possibleenvironment, including the provision of stress coping guidance andinitiatives: such an approach could point out those students whomight be more affected by stress.We believe that these interesting results can still be furtherimproved, namely by using additional modalities. In the presentstudy, we were limited by the hardware available in the examrooms (i.e. mouse, keyboard and screen). In future work we willconsider the inclusion of other sources of information such as web-cams, pressure sensitive keyboards or mice equipped with galvanicskin response sensors, to create a multi-modal approach on theproblem which we expect will improve its accuracy.Concluding, the presented approach unveils interesting futureresearch directions that may lead to a better understanding of thebehavioral effects of stress, namely on Human–Computer Inter-action. Specifically, it may allow to better understand how stressinfluences student behavior during high-stakes exams and even-tually predict other related and important student characteristics.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been supported by COMPETE, Portugal: POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007043 and FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnolo-gia, Portugal within the Project Scope: UID/CEC/00319/2013.
