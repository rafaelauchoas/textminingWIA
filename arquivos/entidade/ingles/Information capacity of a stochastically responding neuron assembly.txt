Smyrnakis1, M. Papadopouli1,2, G. Pallagina3, S. Smirnakis3,41Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research & Technology-Hellas2Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece3Department of Neurology, Brigham and Womens Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA021154Jamaica Plain VA Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolAbstractIn this work, certain aspects of the structure of the overlapping groups of neurons encodingspecific signals are examined. Individual neurons are assumed to respond stochastically to inputsignal. Identification of a particular signal is assumed to result from the aggregate activity of agroup of neurons, which we call information pathway. Conditions for definite response and fornon-interference of pathways are derived. These conditions constrain the response properties ofindividual neurons and the allowed overlap among pathways. Under these constrains, and underthe simplifying assumption that all pathways have similar structure, the information capacity ofthe system is derived. Furthermore, we show that there is a definite advantage in the informationcapacity if pathway neurons areinterspersed among the neuron assembly.1 IntroductionVisual cortex neurons fire action potentials when visual stimuli appear within their receptivefields, and visual information is encoded in real time via the joint firing of multiple neurons.Although much is known about the properties of single neuronal units, the rules by whichcortical neurons coordinate their activity to represent information about stimuli remainelusive. To understand why, one must consider that the responses of single units are bothnoisy and ambiguous [1], [2], with large trial-to-trial variability in response strength andprobability [3], [4]. In other words, repeated responses to the same stimulus varyconsiderably, and responses to multiple different stimuli can be the same. To achieve optimalreal-time performance, these ambiguities must be resolved at the level of neuronalpopulations by the coordinated firing of distinct neuronal ensembles. However, it is not clearhow these ensembles must behave in order to allow stable unambiguous percepts to emerge.In contrast to the typical variability of single neuron firing, typical stimulus induced percepts(e.g., barring bi-stability phenomena and other ambiguous types of stimuli) appear to bedefinite, effectively noise-free, representations of the stimulus. This suggests that thecoordinated firing of appropriate neuronal ensembles, here called”information pathways”, isable to represent and transmit information about a wide class of stimuli with low degree ofuncertainty.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 2One important question is how the pathways, where definite information about the stimulusis encoded, are implemented in the brain. Existence of super-specialized cells that representa specific stimulus class or even unique stimuli has been postulated. Such “grandmother-likecells” that respond reliably to increasingly complex arrangements of the stimuli (objects) arefound in higher associative cortical areas of primates [5], [6]. They are thought to receiveunreliable input from multiple lower-level neurons and integrate it into a definiterepresentation. However, such cells are not found in early visual areas, such as area V1, andthey are elusive even in higher areas. Hence, it is likely that earlier visual areas representdefinite information in the aggregate, nearly simultaneous, firing of ensembles of neuronswhose collective output reliably represents a given stimulus (e.g., an oriented bar in areaV1). In agreement with this, it has been shown that recurring recruitment of feature-selectivecells into co-firing neuronal ensembles occurs during natural visual stimulation by visualscenes in area V1 [7], [8]. Moreover, neurons with similar feature-selectivity have increasedprobability to be wired together even though in rodents they are distributed in a salt andpepper fashion [9],[10]. Such neuronal ensembles likely represent, in part,”informationpathways” that encode specific visual stimulus features.In addition to variability, the neurons in V1 have other three computationally importantproperties. Firstly, their activity under natural visual conditions is sparse with low noisecorrelations [11], [12], [13]. Secondly, V1 possesses a retinotopic map, where nearbyneurons share receptive field locations. Finally, in rodents, despite topografic organization,the feature-selectivity and direction / orientation tuning are not organized in columns, but aredistributed across V1 in salt-and-pepper manner [9], [10]. Diffuse localization of sparselyfiring feature-selective cells may enable efficient encoding of local features in the scene. Thesparsification resulting in low correlated noise enables the fine feature discrimination eventhough the tuning of individual units is relatively broad [3]. In what follows, we assume thatneurons in a pathway respond probabilistically to a stimulus encoded by the pathway, anddifferent pathways form overlapping information representing sets. Neuron responses areconsidered to be independent, reflecting the low value of noise correlations reported in manyvertebrates [14], [15], [13]. Early theoretical considerations [17], [16] suggest thatoptimality is achieved when there is little or no coordinated response of neurons other thanthe one induced by the jointly independent response of neurons to a particular signal. Theseassumptions are based on properties of V1 neuronal responses, which are known to besparse under natural visual stimulation conditions, with low noise correlations and relativelyhigh response variability [11], [12], [13]. Sparsification resulting in low correlated noiseenables fine feature discrimination, even though the tuning of individual units may berelatively broad [3],[18], [19]. Also, it should be added, there is evidence of increasedneuronal decorrelation of pyramidal neurons in mice at adulthood [20], suggesting that asmore information is encoded in the brain, neurons decorrelate.In what follows, we use simple models to identify the basic principles underlying theinformation content of information pathways. Specifically, we explore the computationalproperties that may allow overlapping sparsely firing neuronal assemblies to createunambiguous definite representations of visual stimuli. To achieve this, two conditions haveto be satisfied: (i) The encoding must be definite: the probability of an information pathwayto be active when a stimulus is present should be close to 1, while in the absence of stimulus,Neurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 3the probability should be close to 0. (ii) There should be no significant interference betweendifferent overlapping pathways. We examine the implications of conditions (i) and (ii) on thedegree of pathway overlap and neuronal assembly architecture. Further, we evaluate theinformation capacity of three incrementally more plausible architectures of the informationpathways, and find that, in the most plausible architecture, the number of non-interferingdefinitely responding pathways that can co-exist, increases exponentially in the maximumallowed overlap. This in turn is determined by the response probabilities of the individualneurons. Finally, we examine the validity of our analysis by analyzing a dataset obtained bytwo-photon imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in area V1 of adult mice.The structure of the paper is the following: In Section 2, we analyse the conditions ofdefinite response and of non-interference of overlapping bimodal pathways. In Section 3,three models for overlapping pathway organization are examined, namely the “DenseNeighbourhood Pathway Model”, the “Random Selection Model”, and the “LocalityPreserving Random Selection Pathway Model”. The implications of the organizationprinciple on the information capacity of the system are then assessed. In Section 4, we testthe main findings of the previous sections in the context of the Interneuron PyramidalPartner Groups in adult mouse V1 cortical area, as identified by [21], using the “LocalityPreserving Random Selection Pathway Model” (Section 3), since it appears to be the mostrelevant for a topographically mapped area like V1. Section 5 concludes with our mainremarks. In the appendix, we analyse a variant of the Locality Preserving Random SelectionPathway Model, where the probability that a neuron belongs to a given pathway variesaccording to the distance from the pathway center.2 Overlapping Information Pathways with Bimodal ProbabilisticallyResponding NeuronsIn this section, two important requirements of overlapping pathways are examined, namelythe conditions of definite response to a preferred signal, encoded by each pathway, and thecondition of non-interference among overlapping pathways. These conditions are examinedin the abscense of spontaneous firing as well as in the presence of spontaneous firing.2.1 No Spontaneous FiringHere we assume no spontaneous firing and derive two necessary constraints that allow amulti neuronal ensemble (pathway) to effectively transmit information. The first is that thepathway needs to give a definite response when the signal it is supposed to transmit ispresent despite the fact that its individual constituent units often do not. The second is thatthe activation of a pathway should not induce activation in another pathway whose signal isnot present.Two overlapping information pathways: Let us suppose that we have two informationpathways of n1, n2 neurons each, and suppose that there are two distinct signals S1, S2 thatactivates them respectively. Here it is assumed that each neuron in pathway i has probabilitypi of firing if Si is present and probability 0 of firing if Si is not present. The two pathwaysare assumed to have an overlap of n12 neurons. To decide whether a pathway is active or not,Neurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 4we need to set up a threshold Ki on the number of active neurons. If in pathway i more thanKi neurons are firing, then the pathway is considered active, otherwise it is consideredinactive.Let us now consider the condition for pathway i to be active given that Si is present. Sincethe neurons are bimodal, the probability of more than Ki neurons firing is given by thebinomial distribution:P Fi > Ki ∣ Si = ∑k > Ki − knkqipiniki(1)where qi = 1 − pi is the probability of a neuron not firing when the corresponding signal Si ispresent. This probability is the probability pathway i is active when Si is present.To facilitate the calculation we are going to use the De Moivre-Laplace theorem toapproximate the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. This approximation isconsidered to be good for ni > 30 and for a range of values of k in the sum that is of order niso as to avoid discreteness error. The De Moivre-Laplace theorem tells us:P Fi > Ki ∣ Si ≈12π∫K∞i − niqpniiipe−x2i/2dx ≡ 1 − ΦKi − nipinipiqi(2)where Φ(z) is the normal cumulative distribution function.Let us now focus on the condition of definite response (i) of the pathway to signal Si. Like inany probabilistic response system we have to set a level of certainty above which weconsider the system to give a definite response. Let us call this level 1 − ϵ. The condition ofdefinite response of information pathways Si assumes the form:ΦKi − nipinipiqi< ϵ(3)Condition (3) admits the following interpretation: nipi is the expected number of neuronsthat are firing in pathway i. Condition (3) is satisfied when the expected number of firingneurons is much larger (in units of standard deviation nipiqi) than the threshold Ki.The condition of no interference between the overlapping pathways S1, S2 is a little bit moretricky since one needs to carefully set the thresholds so as to achieve maximal separability ofthe pathways. The probability of Sj, j ≠ i, to cause activity in pathway i is given byP Fi > Ki ∣ S j = ∑k > Kni jkii j − knkq jp j≈ 1 − ΦKi − ni jp jni jp jq j(4)This probability has to be kept low at confidence interval ϵ, and this leads to the condition:Neurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.ΦKi − ni jp jni jp jq j> 1 − ϵPage 5(5)The interpretation of this equation is that the expected number of firing neurons in theoverlap (nijpj) under presentation of signal Sj is much smaller than the threshold Ki ofpathway i.The threshold Ki should be such that the expected number of firing neurons uponpresentation of signal Si is well above Ki, while the expected number of firing neurons inpathway i upon presentation of signal Sj due to the pathway intersection is well below Ki.One could take Ki to be the midpoint of the two expected numbers of firing neurons,however this would ignore possible differences in the standard deviation of the number offiring neurons in the two cases. Instead one should take a weighted average of the twoexpected numbers by the standard deviations as threshold. This is given byKi =nipi ni jp jq j + ni jp j nipiqini jp jq j + nipiqi.(6)Suppose now that we set ϵ = 0.01. Then the condition of definite response (3) can be solvedby using the normal cumulative distribution table to giveKi − nipinipiqi< − 2.33.Furthermore, the condition of no interference gives similarlyKi − ni jp jni jp jq j> 2.33(7)(8)Setting the threshold to the optimal value (6) the conditions (7) and (8) collapse to the singleconditionnipi − ni jp jni jp jq j + nipiqi> 2.33(9)In the brain there are multiple pathways consisting in principle with different numbers ofconstituent neurons each of which fires with different probability when the optimal stimulusis present. To simplify things for modeling, we consider pathways consisting of n neurons,each of which fires with probability p to its optimal signal (the signal that activates thepathway).In this case, the optimal threshold for two overlapping pathways, with overlap m, is given byNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.K =np m + mp nm + nUnder this choise of optimal threshold, the conditions of definite response and nointerference (7) and (8) now collapse to the single condition( n − m)pq > 2.33Page 6(10)(11)To have maximum number of encoding pathways it is necessary to increase the overlap m toa maximum value m0, without violating condition (11). This is achieved whenm0 = ( n − 2.33 q/ p)2(12)where the brackets here denote integer part.Fig.1 shows how the value of the maximum overlap m0 varies as a function of theprobability of neuronal response p for a fixed number n = 1000 of neurons in a pathway.Already at p = 0.06 we have a possible 50% overlap. Hence, we can say that for maximalnumber of non-interfering definitely responding pathways of size n = 1000, even for verylow probabilities of response, high overlaps are possible.Hence, we can say that, even when individual neuron responses occur with very lowprobability, high pathway overlaps are possible while still achieving a near maximal numberof non-interfering, definite, pathway responses. A downstream neuron connected to such apathway and thresholding the overall input at the optimal threshold successfully receivesthen the information that the pathway carries. Such an information transmission system is inprinciple implementable in real biological neuronal networks.In sum, in the absence of spontaneous activity equation (12) determines the maximumallowed overlap (m0) between two pathways as a function of the neuronal responseprobability (p, q = 1 − p) to the optimal signal that the pathway carries and the pathwayconstituent neuron number (n). In the next section we examine the effect of spontaneousactivity on the maximum allowed pathway overlap.2.2 Overlapping Pathways in the Presence of Spontaneous FiringLet us now suppose that each pathway has n bimodal neurons and that a pair of pathwayshas m neuron overlap, as before. In this case, we will assume that there is a spontaneousprobability of firing p0 for a neuron not participating in a pathway whose signal is present.There is also a stimulated probability of firing p when the neuron is in a pathway whoseassociated signal is present.The spontaneous firing may arise in many ways. It may be, for example, built in the networkso as to maintain dynamic equilibrium. After all, excess firing will generate too much inputto the network and this may lead to seizure if network control fails, while not firing mayNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 7result in too little input to the network leading to global silencing. Another source ofspontaneous firing may be the parallel operation of overlapping pathways. It is possible thata neuron belongs not only to the pair of pathways considered here, but also to a thirdpathway that may or may not be active in parallel to our pair of pathways. It is quite possiblethat both sources of spontaneous firing mentioned exist and cooperate in the brain.A further source for the “spontaneous” firing (probability p0) may be simply the signal to thesecond pathway that is causing increased probability of response to the first pathway. Thismay happen for example if the signals are close orientation gratings. In this case bothorientation gratings generate increased response to the neurons of a pathway, however thepreferred orientation generates response with higher probability p than the nearbyorientation which generates a response with probability p0. In this case we will refer to thepathways as close signal pathways and to the difference dp = p − p0 as the probabilityresolution of the two pathways.As before, there is a threshold K for the number of active neurons in a pathway, above whichthe pathway is considered active. The condition of definite response again assumes the formΦK − npnpq < ϵ,However, in this case, there is one further condition, the condition of non-spontaneousresponseP Fi > K ∣ NoSignal ≈ 1 − ΦK − np0qnp00< ϵ .(13)(14)Fortunately, this condition is weaker than the non-interference condition hence it isautomatically imposed.The non-interference condition in this case assumes the formP Fi > K ∣ S j = ∑k, l, k + l > Kmlplqm − l n − mkkqp0n − m − k0< ϵ .(15)It is not too difficult to show, following a proof similar to the De Moivre-Laplace theorem,that in the limit n ≫ m, m ≫ 1, P(Fi > K|Sj) can be approximated byP Fi > K ∣ S j ≈ 1 − ΦK − (n − m)pq(n − m)p00 − mp0 + mpq.(16)This leads to the non-interference conditionNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.ΦK − (n − m)pq(n − m)p00 − mp0 + mpq> 1 − ϵIn this case, the optimal choice of threshold isK =np (n − m)pq0(n − m)p0q0 + mpq + npq0 + mpq + (n − m)p0 + mp npqPage 8(17)(18)As before, setting the confidence limit ϵ = 0.01, the two conditions collapse to the followingcondition:(n − m) p − p(n − m)p0q00 + mpq + npq> 2.33.(19)It is this condition that determines the maximum allowed overlap m0 of distinct pathways inthe presence of spontaneous firing.Condition 19 also admits a different interpretation. Suppose that we have two overlappingpathways and two stimuli, A,B, corresponding to the pathways A,B respectively. If the twosignals are close to each other (e.g., nearby orientations), then it is possible that signal Aevokes responce to pathway B neurons with a probability p0 only slightly smaller than theresponce p of pathway B neurons to signal B, and correspondingly for pathway A. In thissetup, the overlap threshold m0 admits the interpretation of the maximum overlap allowed sothat the two pathways can resolve the two signals at probability difference dp = p − p0. Thevalue of m0 as a function of p is shown in Fig.2.What is important in Fig.2 is the fact that there is a minimum overlap threshold for a givenprobability resolution dp, irrespective of the precise values of p, p0 as long as dp = p − p0remains fixed. Hence, if the overlap is kept below this minimum threshold, the two pathwayscan resolve the two signals keeping the individual neuron response probability well below 1.This allows an extra freedom in the operation of the information pathways that may benecessary to account for firing rate fluctuations in the brain, as well as to extra constraints inthe firing probabilities of pathway neurons that may arise from requirements for informationprocessing.In the next section we are going to address the question of packing, that is we will assumethat we have an assembly of pathways, and that each pathway encodes a different signal. Wewill ask how many different signals can be encoded in non-interfering pathways undervarious pathway architectures. In all these models a maximum overlap m0 will be allowed.This m0 will be the one determined in this section through equation (19).Neurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 93 Number of Signals EncodedLet us now try to address the question of how many signals can be encoded independentlyon a set of N neurons given that the pathway size is n and the maximal overlap allowed is m0< n.3.1 Dense Neighbourhood Pathway ModelIn this model, we are going to assume that the neurons are irregularly and randomly placedin a cortex layer. We will furthermore assume that pathways are constructed bygeometrically adjascent neurons placed closest together.2D Case: In this case neurons are irregularly and randomly placed on a surface modeling acortex layer. Pathways form discs with all neurons in the disc participating in the pathway.Hence, the number of neurons in this model is proportional to the surface area that theyoccupy. We will assign a surface density d to the number of neurons per unit area. Hence,the areas associated to N, n and to the overlap m are AN = N/d, An = n/d and Am = m/d.Since the pathways are circular, we can associate a radius Rn = An/π = n/πd. The overlaparea Am is the overlap of two discs, and the size of this area is fully determined by the radiusof the pathway discs and the distance of the centers of the pathways. In fact it is easy toshow thatAm = 2Rn2sin−12 − D2/4RnRn− D Rn2 − D2/4 .(20) allowed forBy inverting relation (20) it is possible to determine the minimum distance Dm0 that corresponds to m0 neurons.a maximum overlap Am0Defining the regularized distances with respect to the density Rn = Rn d, D = D d, (20)assumes the formm = 2nπsin−1n/π − D2n/π/4− D n/π − D2/4 .(21)Consider now the question of how many pathways of size n fit in N neurons if the maximaloverlap allowed is m0 neurons. This question corresponds to the question of how manycircles of radius Rn fit within an area AN of neurons if the nearest distance of their centers.allowed is Dm0This is a question that can be answered easily if we ignore insignificant edge effectsassociated with the exact shape of the area AN. For closest packing, the centers of theNeurocomputing.

Hence, we get that the number of pathways Np isN p =AN2Ac=2N3dDm2 =02N23Dm0(22)From equation (22) we see that the number of pathways Np increases linearly with N, butwith a proportionality coefficient that depends on both n, m0.The graph of this proportionality coefficient for maximum overlap m0 is depicted in Fig.3for n = 1000 pathway neurons. As can be seen, Np/N increases with increasing m0, howeveronly for very large overlaps it becomes comparable to 1.3D Case: Here, the neurons are irregularly and randomly placed in three dimensions,essentially considering the cortical layer to be thick, hence allowing three dimensionalstructure. We will also assume, as in the 2D case, that pathways are constructed by adjascentneurons placed closest together, forming overlapping spheres that are closest packed at theoverlap permitted. Hence the centers of the pathways form a closest packed sphere lattice(hexagonal close packed or cubic close packed lattice). In this case, a volume neuron densityd associates volumes with neuron numbers, giving VN = N/d for the volume of the aggregateof neurons, Vn = n/d for the volume of the neurons in a pathway and Vm = m/d for thevolume of the neurons in the overlap of two pathways. The radius of the pathway sphere is3Rn = 3Vn/4πgiven by3= 3n/4πd. The overlap volume of two overlapping spheres distance D apart isV m =112π 4Rn + D 2Rn − D 2 .Regularizing by setting Rn = Rn d3 , D = D d3 , (23) assumes the formm =1123π(4 3n/4π3+ D)(2 3n/4π− D)2.(23)(24)Suppose now that m0 is the maximum allowed overlap, so that pathways do not interferewith each other. By inverting numerically equation (24) it is possible to obtain the minimum allowed between the centers of the pathways. The maximum number ofdistance Dm0pathways that can be packed at this minimum distance is equal to the number of auxiliaryhard spheres of radius Dm0/2 that can be packed in the volume VN. A theorem of Gauss tellsus that the maximum fraction of volume that can be occupied by closely packed hardspheres is π/3 2. Hence the volume of the auxiliary spheres is Vaux =πVN3 2 and the numberNeurocomputing.

Since this is theN p =V auxV HS=V N 2Dm3 =0N 23Dm0(25)Equations (24,25) implicitly determine the number of pathways in terms of the number ofpathway neurons n and the maximum allowed number of overlap neurons m0. Again, thenumber of pathways increases linearly in the number of neurons N, but with a higherproportionality coefficient than in the 2D case, as can be seen in Fig.3. It is important to notethat in either the 2D or the 3D case the Dense Neighborhood Pathway Model can encodeonly a relatively small number of signals, linear in the total number of neurons (N).Furthermore, to achieve maximum encoding, a regular topography of pathways needs to beimplemented. Such a regular connectivity topography may be difficult to maintain in detailand does not seem to be implemented in mouse V1. In the next section, we will see thatmore dilute and intermixed pathway models significantly increase the capacity forinformation transmission.3.2 Random Selection ModelIn the previously described models, the information pathways formed were local in the sensethat neurons in a pathway were neighbouring neurons. They were also dense in the sensethat all neurons within a radius from the pathway center are in the pathway. Both theserestrictions limit severely the number of pathways that are non-interfering. To betterunderstand these limitations suppose the pathway neurons are chosen from the fullaggregate. Suppose that we are given a set of N neurons, and that each neuron is chosen atrandom with probability p = n/N to participate in a particular pathway. This does not quitefix the pathway neurons to be n, but rather demands the expectation value of the number ofpathway neurons to be n. Let us say that the non-interference condition allows m0 neuronoverlaps among distinct pathways and that activation of a pathway by co-activation of twoother pathways is a rare event and can be ignored. A sketch of the pathway structure of themodel is depicted in Fig.4.Since the overlap neuron number m determines whether there exists interference amongpathways we need to calculate the overlap probability P (O = m) where O is the two pathwayoverlap random variable. To do this suppose that we have fixed the n neurons of pathway Pi,and that we count the ways we can choose the neurons of pathway Pj so as to have m neuronoverlap. This number of ways is nmN − mn − mpathways Pi, Pj is. Hence, the probability of m overlap in theNeurocomputing.

Then we can applyStirling’s formula to get the N dependence of the overlap probability. Doing this we getP(O = m) =1m!n!(n − m)!2N−m.(26)(27)The importance of this formula is that P (O = m) ~ N−m. Suppose now that the condition ofno interference is O < m0. Then the probability of interference of the two pathways isP O ≥ mn0 = ∑m = mP(O = m)01m0!n!n − m0 !2N−m0 .(28)To determine the number of non-interfering pathways Np in this model we have to set a levelof tolerance since the pathway overlap is stochastic. A rather strict tolerance level, thatguarrantees that the pathways are operating properly, is to demand that it is unlikely to haveone interfering pair per pathway. This is equivalent to saying that the expected number ofinterfering pairs is a small ϵ fraction of the number of pathways.0.5N p N p − 1 P O ≥ m0 < ϵN p .This means that the allowed number of non-interfering pathways isN p 2ϵm0!0 !n − mn!2m0N(29)(30)Observe that the situation here is very different from the situation in either the 2D or the 3Ddense neighbourhood pathway models. Here the number of non-interfering pathwaysmincreases like a power of the number of neurons, N p Nmodels it increases linearly in the number of neurons, Np ~ N. Hence, the random selectionmodel can store much more information than the dense neighbourhood pathway models,suggesting that the brain architecture may drop locality when there are many distinct signalsto be encoded.0, while in either of the geometricNevertheless, there is also a penalty to pay. This model for pathway construction is notappropriate when topographical mapping has to be maintained. Since this happens in theearly visual areas, this model may not be appropriate for pathways in V1. What we need inNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 13V1 is a model that will take the advantages of dilute pathways and combine them with thelocality of the pathways in the dense neighbourhood pathway models. Such a model is theLocality Preserving Random Selection Pathway Model.3.3 Locality Preserving Random Selection Pathway ModelThis model assumes that the n pathway neurons are uniformly distributed within a distanceRn from the pathway center. The purpose of this restriction is to allow for spatially localizedpathways, that are necessary for the encoding of local features in topographically mappedareas like V1.2D Case: Two densities are associated with this model. One is the neuron density d = N/Area, and the other is the pathway neuron density dn = n/πRnnumber Nn of neurons within radius Rn from the pathway center is Nn = πRngreater than the number of pathway neurons n. The probability p that a neuron within radiusRn from the pathway center belongs to the pathway is p = dn/d = n/Nn. We will also assumethat the maximum overlap permitted between pathways is m0 neurons, which is determinedby the response properties of the neurons. The structure of the pathways of the model isdepicted in Fig.4.2. In terms of these densities the2d and this isIf the pathways form a closest packed lattice, as in the 2D geometric model, then theadjacent pathway overlap area is again given by (20). However the expected number ofoverlap neurons m is modified by the ratio of the two densities:m = 2nπsin−1n/π − D2n/π/4− D n/π − D2/4nNn(31), and D = D dn are again the appropriate dimensionless radius and pathwayHere Rn = Rn dncenter distance. Solving implicitly (31) for D after substituting the maximum overlap m0 for.m, gives us the minimum pathway distance Dm0If Dm is different from zero, this is sufficient to give the maximum number of pathways that0can be packed in our neuron area to be2NP = Area/2Atriang.cell = 2N / 3Dm0.(32)In this case, the maximum number of pathways NP increases linearly with the number ofneurons present.The situation can change when Dm0= 0. From (31) it is easy to see that this happens whenm0 ≥ n2/Nn .(33)Neurocomputing.

However, iftoo many overlapping pathways are present, some pairs will interfere. In this case, it isunlikely to maintain closest packed structure for the pathway centers. Let us denote by NIthe number of interfering pairs. As in the Random Selection Model, we will demand that theexpected number of interfering pairs is small compared to the number of pathways,ENI < N pϵ .Let us consider now two adjacent pathways. The probability pb that a random neuronbelongs to the overlap of these pathways is given bypb =AmAreap2 =mNp2(34)(35)where Am is the overlap area and Area is the area of all the neurons.

This means that once we have dilute enough pathways, so that the is satisfied, then the number of allowed, non-interfering pathways,condition n ≤ mincreases rapidly. Furthermore, once the diluteness of the pathways is regulated in the brain,pathways can be randomly placed in almost arbitrarily large numbers without significantinterference. In practice however there probably are other restrictions, not to be studied here,that limit the number of pathways allowed, like for example the ability of the brain to adressthese pathways.03D Case: The situation in 3D differs only by the geometric factors.

Locality is kept from the DenseNeighborhood Pathway Model, but it is less strict since there is random neuron selectionwithin local neighborhoods. This allows for an increased number of pathways encodingdistinct signals to be implemented, albeit not quite as many as in the Random SelectionModel. This model exhibits two limiting conditions: 1) If the minimum distance between thepathway centers remains significantly greater than zero then the number of pathwaysincreases linearly in N, similar to the Dense Neighborhood Pathway Model. However, 2) ifthe minimum distance allowed can approach zero, which means that pathway centerlocations may overlap without too many common neurons, then the number of pathwaysencoded increases exponentially in the maximum allowed overlap m0, though only linearlyin the overall number of neurons N. In this limit, this model can still encode a vast numberof distinct signals, while maintaining a local structure that does not require a regularpathway topography. Of course, in real animals, though neuronal pathways are likely to beintermixed they are unlikely to represent a realization of the idealized models we considerhere. Realistic connectivity profiles are more likely to peak at close distances and then dropas a function of distance rather than be truly random within a localized domain of a certainradius. However, the effect of these differences is not expected to alter the basic exponentialdependence described.4. Effect of Simultaneous Activity of Many PathwaysUp to this stage we have not considered the simultaneous activation of multiple pathways.However, in real animals, this is not the case. Hence it is possible that an inactive pathway Preceives interference from more than one overlapping pathways. Here we estimate the effectthat the parallel activation of multiple pathways has on the interference an inactive pathwayreceives. We find that the Dense Neighborhood Pathway Model and the Locality PreservingRandom Selection Pathway Model when pathway centers are forced to remain at asignificant distance away from each other (first case), receive little interference frommultiple pathway activation unless a large fraction of existing pathways is simultaneouslyactivated. In contrast, the Random Selection Model and the Locality Preserving RandomNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 18Selection Pathway Model when pathway centers can approach each other (second case)generally exhibit significant interference from the simultaneous activation of multiplepathways. The reason is that in these cases much larger overlaps between pathways areallowed (Section 3), so a small fraction of active pathways may be able to activate themajority of neurons in pathways that should otherwise be silent. Nevertheless, if this fractionis kept small, the number of pathways that can be activated in parallel without producinginterference increases exponentially in the number of neurons that must be firing within apathway to activate it.Let us consider the effect of two coactive pathways that overlap with a given pathway P, ineither the Dense Neighbourhood Pathway Model or the Locality Preserving RandomSelection Pathway Mode in the first state. If Pp ≪ 1 is the fraction of pathways that areactive at a particular time, and the number of pathways overlapping with P, OP, of order 1,then the probability that two overlapping pathways are active together isOpOp − 122 1 − PpPpOp − 2= O Pp2 . If the probability that two overlapping pathways with Pare coactive is small, the probability of interference on P by the coactivity of pairs ofoverlapping pathways is also expected to be small, assuming of course that there is no biason which pathways are active at a particular time.The situation is different when one considers the Random Selection Model or the LocalityPreserving Random Selection Pathway Model in its second state. The reason for this is that aparticular pathway P may overlap with a large number of pathways, hence the effect ofmultiple active pathways is not negligible. To estimate the effect of this, we will assume thata fraction f (significantly smaller than 1) of the N neurons available is active at a particulartime due to the activation of multiple pathways. Since the construction of pathways israndom, we can assume that these active neurons are uniformly distributed in the aggregate.Now the probability that the pathway P receives input from m aggregate firing neurons isP I A = m =nmN − nf N − mNf Nnm(1 − f )n − m f m(54)and the probability that m exceeds the pathway activation threshold, m ≥ K, is bounded bynP I A ≥ K = ∑m = KnP I A = m ∑m = Knm(1 − f )n − m f m≤ eKn fK(55)provided that the expected number of aggregate firing neurons within our pathway P, nf ≪K. If we now demand that the expected number of pathways NpP (IA ≥ K) sufferinginterference is smaller than ϵ, then we haveN p ≤ ϵKKen f(56)Neurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 19Hence, in this case the number of non-interfering pathways increases exponentially in theminimum number of active neurons necessary to activate the pathway P.It is important to note that the number of non-interfering pathways allowed can increasetowards the prior limit (Section 3) if there is a mechanism to diminish the probability ofactivation in potentially interfering parallel pathways, when a particular pathway is active. Itis possible that a mechanism to reduce parallel-pathway interfering activity may be providedby attention: for example, the neural pathway that encodes an attended object tends to beenhanced while pathways that encode unattended objects are relatively silenced.5 Test case: Interneuron Pyramidal Partner Groups in mouse V1We will try to test the implications of the above calculations with two-photon data collectedfrom layer II/III of the V1 area of adult mice [21]. In [21], Palagina et al. raise the possibilitythat pyramidal neurons connected to certain types of interneurons may form distinctinterconnected information pathways. We note that this is not a universally acceptedassumption, as there is evidence that various types of interneurons also exert more global,non-specific, control over their neighboring neuronal circuit. Nevertheless, we believe thatthere may be room for both hypotheses: for example, under certain conditions, globalquenching of the network activity may be required, while under others it may be beneficialto have the capacity to specifically quench the activity of one pathway while sparing activityin nearby distinct pathways. The latter can be efficiently accomplished if there is a “localcontroller” of information pathways, and this role may be played by specific interneurons.Accordingly, there is evidence that pyramidal neurons, functionally connected to a particularinterneuron, tend to have similar tuning properties [21], which is compatible with thepossibility that they form a joined group processing information [21],[22],[23].Such groups of pyramidal neurons linked to local interneurons may represent a frameworkof information pathways. In such a cluster, the coordinated firing of functionally similarpyramidal cells may be controlled by the partner interneuron(s). Of course it is unlikely thatthere is an interneuron dedicated to every pathway because this would demand too manyinterneurons. Indeed, many types of interneurons were shown to form synapses with amajority of pyramidal cells in the vicinity [24],[25],[26], [27], [28]. The coexistence of thisblanket anatomical connectivity and feature-selective interneuron – pyramidal cell functionalclusters, likely results from the graded synaptic connectivity strength between an individualinterneuron and pyramidal cells that surround it [26], [29], [30], [31], and also from thegraded synaptic connectivity strength between pyramidal cells themselves and from thespecificity of their connections [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Thus, during operationunder natural viewing conditions, when the activity of V1 neurons is sparse [11], [39], [12],[38], a specific feature likely recruits only a subset of pyramidal cells and interneurons withstrongest reciprocal connections. Such subsets may represent largely separated feature-selective information pathways with low inter-pathway interference.Here we proceed under the assumption that the interneuron-pyramidal-partner clusterpathways identified by Palagina et al. [21](see also [22]) constitute basic informationprocessing pathways, and we apply the strategy outlined above to check whether suchNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 20pathways have internal consistency with regard to their information encoding properties. Asthe groups identified have limited spatial extent, we will use the locality preserving randomselection pathway model after extrapolating the data, which were acquired inplane, to 3-dimensions. To perform the extrapolation we use the fact that neuronal diameter is 10microns, therefore in-plane photon recordings typically record from neurons over a thicknessof dt 20 microns. The cut-off radius for extrapolation was taken to be Rn 250 microns, thedistance over which functional connectivity of pyramidal neurons to the “parent”interneuron decays [21]. We assume constant pyramidal neuron density within Rn. Althoughapproximate, this should capture the basic structure of the pathways described in [42],[40],[41]. Note that we do not in any way imply that the pathways have a strictly spherical shape.The actual pathways have significant directional properties and their extend is anywaylimited by the border of the mouse cortical layer (layer 2/3).The overlap between different pathways is estimated as follows: First two interneurons i, jare selected. With the interneuron positions as pathway centers, the area of the intersection,Aij, of the circles of radius Rn that is within our recording area, is selected and pathwayintersection neurons that are within Aij counted. Table 1 lists these overlaps from anexperiment whose field of view contained 5 interneurons. This number is associated tocortical volume Vij = Aij × dt, and can be extrapolated to the overlap volume of the twospheres of radius Rn by proportionality (results listed in table 1). The diagonal elements oftable 1 correspond to the number of pyramidal neurons that constitute the informationprocessing pathway associated with each interneuron, and the last column (Nn) is the totalnumber of pyramidal neurons contained within sphere Rn, whether they belong to thecorresponding pathway or not.We then ask the question whether the extrapolated intersection numbers Nij (table 1) arecompatible with the definite-response non-interference condition computed in equation (19).In order for pathways not to interfere with each other with confidence limit ϵ = 0.01, ϵ =0.05 and ϵ = 0.1, the discriminant (D) given byD =(n − m) p − p(n − m)pq000 + mpq + npq(57)should be D > 2.33, D > 1.65 or D > 1.29 respectively. For orientation tuning, p stands forthe neuron probability of response at its orientation tuning, while p0 is the probability ofresponse at resolution angle to the orientation tuning. Since typical values of both p and p0vary considerably depending on the tuning of particular neurons, we will only fix theprobability resolution dp = p − p0 = 0.1 to typical values, and we will take a near worst casescenario by assuming p = 0.5, p0 = 0.4. This maximizes the potential for interference of twooverlapping pathways (neuron number n, overlap neurons m), tuned at resolution angledifference, each responding to its orientation tuning with probability p and to the orientationtuning of the other with probability p0. (dp = 0.1; see fig.2).Fig.5 plots the values of D for all pairs of interneuron pathways obtained from 4 differentanimals. Horizontal lines represent confidence limit thresholds. Note that all but onepathway pairs (x-axis) satisfy the non-interference definite-response condition at the ϵ =Neurocomputing.

Naturally, much more work is needed totest empirically how the predictions of the model fit with experimental data in differentinformation encoding situations. In the future, we plan to check this for different types ofinformation processing pathways in different V1 cortical layers.6 ConclusionWe examined the properties of neuronal information encoding pathways under a series ofsimplifying assumptions. Individual neurons were assumed to respond stochastically to inputsignals and definite encoding of a particular signal was assumed to result from the aggregatenear synchronous activity of a set of neurons, which form an information encoding pathway.We then derived conditions for the response of this pathway to be (i) definite, and (ii) not tointerfere with the spontaneous firing of neighboring distinct pathways.The following conclusions can be drawn: (a) Information capacity of neuron”informationpathway” ensembles is severely limited if pathways are dense. Hence, it is not favored tohave pathways that include all neurons within a region around the pathway center. Thereason for this is that pathways cannot come close together without causing interference.Maximization of the information capacity in this case forces the pathways to maintain alattice geometric structure (ordered phase) which is not observed in mouse V1. In contrast,intermixed pathways allow random spatial placement of pathway centers (disordered phase),achieving much larger information capacity. (b) For pathways in the ordered phase, andassuming that only pairwise overlaps cause confusion, the number of pathways that fit in anN-neuron ensemble increases linearly in N. In the random selection model without distancem0 where m0 is therestriction, this linear behavior changes to a power law behavior Nmaximum allowed overlap between two pathways. However, this is not realistic sincepathways are formed by random selection of neurons from the whole neuron assembly. Amore realistic hybrid model that maintains locality while allowing “dilute” pathways is thelocality preserving random selection pathway model with a sharp cutoff. For this model,once the density of neurons engaged in the formation of pathways is low enough to allowcomplete overlap of the pathways (in the geometric sense), the pathway organization entersin the disordered phase. In this phase, the number of pathways increases linearly in N butexponentially in m0, allowing a large number of non-interfering pathways to coexist. Herem0 is expected to be a significant fraction of the number of pathway neurons. (c) A similarbehavior is expected to occur for a more realistic model that does not exhibit a sharp cutoffor a completely random connectivity distribution, but has the probability that a neuronbelongs to a pathway drop with distance from the pathway center (see Appendix), assumingthis probability is small enough to ensure pathways are “dilute”. This occurs because forsufficiently “dilute” pathways it is possible to bring two pathway centers on top of eachother without an overlap higher than the allowed overlap m0, leading to an exponentialm0. The exponential increase in the number of non-increase in the number of pathways Neinterfering pathways arises from counting the geometrically overlapping pathways that are“dilute” enough not to interfere with each other. (d) We used our model to study a particulartype of postulated information processing pathway consisting of pyramidal neuronsfunctionally connected to particular “partner” interneurons in Layer 2/3 of area V1 of adultNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 22mice [21]. Pathways identified were found to satisfy the constraints imposed by our models.However, the analysis we propose here is more general and should apply to differentlyidentified neuronal ensembles that constitute information encoding pathways. (e) Finally, wedid not attempt to model in a realistic way the molecular, synaptic, cellular and multi-cellular biological components which store, address or transmit information. The advantageof doing this is that it allowed us to extract from first principles basic constraints that aregenerally applicable for transmitting information without interference in neural networksystems, under the simplifying assumptions we state above. As such the work applies tomultiple different neural systems and organisms that may have very different biologicalimplementations. Studying specific biological implementations of the above principles is animportant direction for future experimental and modelling work.The most important simplifications we made in drawing our conclusions are the following:(a) Definite information is carried by pathways that are either collectively active or inactive,based on whether a signal is present or not (“bimodal pathways”). Such bimodal pathwaysseem to be well suited for object and discrete signal recognition, such as parallel (pop-up)object recognition. Similar pathways have been theorized to contribute to neuralcomputations [42],[41] and bear resemblance to ensembles of neurons that encode odors inthe olfactory system of the fruit fly, particularly in the Kenyon cell group[43],[44],[45],[40],[41]. Information from the olfactory receptors converges to projection neurons and then it isvastly sparsified by projecting to approximately 2500 kenyon cells through randomconnections [44], [43]. Simulations carried out in [45] indicate that the formation of sparseprobabilistic information pathways (termed odor hashes) allows for maintaining efficientlyodor similarity according to the overlap of the sets of pathway neurons encoding the distinctodors. This suggests the formation of sparse pathways, that are not only non-interferingsince thay encode distinct odors, but that also maintain information carrying overlapstructure. (b) We took all pathways to have equal size and neurons to be randomly placedwithin the physical region where the pathway lies. Size equality is similar to the ‘EqualCitizen’ principle proposed by Valiant [42]. We do not expect these assumptions to lead toqualitative differences in the conclusions we draw. (c) The response properties of individualneurons are stochastic and were taken to have similar probability for all neurons in a givenpathway. It is evident that in real mice not all neurons have the same response properties,however this simplifying assumption still captures the essential qualitative features thatemerge at our level of analysis. (d) Another implicit assumption is that the neuron orneurons that will “read” the output of an “information pathway” has the ability to adjust itsthreshold, or the synaptic inputs it receives from the pathway, so as to achieve maximaldiscriminability. This is the same thing as saying that if the pathway can distinguish amongtwo signals, then the read-out neuron can also read this distinction. This implies a sigmoidresponse function of adjustable slope and seems also to be physiologically plausible.Note that, although information capacity increases drastically in the disordered phase, theability to manipulate and address this information can be problematic. For example, letsassume that there is a direct control on pathways by interneurons as argued in [21]. Thenumber of interneurons is much smaller (at best on the order of 15%) than the number ofneurons N, hence this would likely limit too severely the information capacity unlesscombinations of interneurons are used to adress pathways. However, one pyramidal neuronNeurocomputing. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 14.  AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptSmyrnakis et al.Page 23is functionally connected with only a small number of interneurons. Nevertheless, in somesituations it would be advantageous to exert direct control over the pathways in a way inwhich the organism can turn one pathway on or off selectively, without interfering withdistinct neighboring pathways that encode other signals. Hence there must be a mechanismto address individual information pathways for information processing and memoryretrieval. In this work, we do not attempt to answer the important question of pathwayaddressing. It might well be that interneuron control is not exerted over single pathways, butrather over specific “root” pathways that may control the thread of information processingacross multiple more elementary pathways.The way information pathways are packed together can teach us about the structure of thefiring patterns of neurons that encode and transmit information. Experiments thatconcentrate on extracting information from multi-neuronal population activity are expectedto reveal the structure of the information pathways that operate in neocortical areas andwhether their properties conform with our predictions, as well as with the predictions ofother groups (e.g., [42], [40], [41],[45]) that study associations and memory. Furtherexperimental and theoretical work on the nature of information pathways and how they getmodified by learning has a lot to teach us about how computations are performed in thebrain.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported in part by the Simons Foundation Research Award #402047 and the NEI RO1 awardEY024019 to SS.This work was also funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation (HFRI) and General Secretariatfor Research & Technology (GSRT), Project # 2285 (neuronXnet).We would like to thank Thomais Asvestopoulou for her editorial review.Appendix7 Appendix: The Case where the Pathway Inclusion Probability Dependson Distance from Pathway Center7.1 2D CaseLet us now suppose that there is a probability P (|r − rA|) for a neuron at position r to belongto the pathway A, whose center is located at rA.

Again, the probability of interference Pm0 of two pathways is given inrA − rBterms of this 3D overlap probability pb by equation (62).As in the locality preserving random selection pathway model, we expect that we have twophases assuming maximum pathway number. One is the ordered phase where pathwaycenters are not allowed to overlap, since in this phase two overlapping pathways shareenough neurons to cause interference in their operation. This phase occurs when thepathways are “dense”. The other phase is the disordered phase. In this case, even when thepathway centers overlap, the number of common neurons in the two pathways is small andnot sufficient to cause interference. In this case, the lattice structure is difficult to maintain,since two pathways can, on their own, come as close as necessary. In this phase, pathwayscan be randomly placed on the plane or 3D space up to a certain density of pathways thatmakes interference likely. This second phase occurs when pathways are “dilute” in the sensethat within a neighbourhood of the pathway center a small fraction of the neurons belongs tothe pathway. As has become clear from the locality preserving random selection pathwaymodel, in this phase the information capacity is very large, increasing exponentially in thenumber of overlapping neurons.References[1].

The value of D should beabove the cutoff line for every pair of pathways to avoid interference. The three cutoff linescorrespond to the confidence limits ϵ = 0.01, ϵ = 0.05 and ϵ = 0.1. The top left panelcorresponds to the table dataset. Interneuron pair (3,4) appears to have interference. Notethat the two interneurons are also very close together.
