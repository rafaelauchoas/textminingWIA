Artificial Intelligence 88 ( 1996) 163-193 Artificial Intelligence Possibilistic reasoning- a mini-survey and uniform semantics * Churn-Jung Liau a,*, Bertrand I-Peng Lin b,l a InsMute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan h Department of CSIE, National Taiwan Universiq, Taipei, Taiwan Received April 1995; revised March 1996 Abstract In this paper, we survey some quantitative and qualitative approaches to uncertainty management theory and present a logical framework to integrate them. The semantics based on possibility for possibility theory. It is then of the logic is based on the Dempster’s rule of conditioning logic, possibilistic logic, quantitative modal logic shown that classical modal logic, conditional and qualitative possibilistic logic are all sublogics of the presented logical framework. In this way, we can formalize and generalize some well-known results about possibilistic reasoning in a uniform semantics. Moreover, our uniform framework is applicable to nonmonotonic reasoning, approximate consequence relation formulation, and partial consistency handling. Keywords: Nonclassical logics; Possibility theory; Conditional possibility; Modal logic; Conditional logic 1. Introduction There are essentially two kinds of logical and necessity. On the one hand, ity and necessity of logical formulas of this approach are possibilistic [ 341). For example, that the necessity spectively.

Liau, RI-P: Lin/Art$cial Intelligence 88 (1996) 163-193 165 To form the wffs of modal logic, a new unary connective 0 is added to propositional logic and an additional rule for formation of modal formulas is needed: Furthermore, l if f is a wff, then Of 10 A possible world model -f is, too. is abbreviated as Of. logic for modal set of possible worlds, R 2 W x W is a binary W, and V : PV -+ 2” assigns satisfies the condition the model is a triplet M = (W, R, V), where W is a relation on in PV a subset of W. If R symbol that for all w E W there exists u E W such that (w, u) E R, then the truth set is called serial. Given a model M and a wff f, we can define relation called accessibility to each propositional I&4 as A formula if f E PV, if f = lg, if f = gV h, [ {w I VU((W,U) E R + u E lgliu)}, if f = Og. f is satisfiable IflM = W.

Conditional logic The original purpose of conditional conditional of conditional in natural language logic to nonmonotonic logic is to provide a formal [ 391. Recently, tool for the analysis there have been a number in AI reasoning and belief revision of subjunctive of applications research [ 22,291. The syntax of conditional logic binary connective + and the following is an extension of the propositional rule: formation language with a l if f and g are wffs, then f --+ g is also a wff. As for the semantics, there are some competitive paradigms which lead to different rea- to the related to possibilistic [39]. The one most closely semantics proposed by Lewis in [ 71, we describe a system-of-spheres model logics is the system-of-spheres systems of conditional soning reformulation of conditional logic as a triple M = (W ( <,,,)wE~, V), where W and V are the same as in the possible relation world models almost con- (called preference nectedness, closer) in w if u <,+, u. The set W, =def {u I 30,u <, u} than u from the viewpoint of an agent is called the accessible worlds from w. The worlds not in W, are considered to Ramsey test, f -4 g is true in w iff an agent from w. Then, according almost reflexivity, a world u is more possible logic, and for each w E W, <,+.G W x W is a binary and nonvacuity. 2 Intuitively, impossible in w comes on W satisfying [33].

Possibility theory and related logics 2.3.1. Possibility theoq Possibility theory is developed by Zadeh from fuzzy set theory W, a possibility distribution on W is a function ?r : W 4 the normalized is a characteristic from 7r. They are called possibility fl, N : 2w - respectively. Formally, [ 441. Given a universe [ 0, 11. In general, we require r function of a fuzzy subset of W. Two measures on W can be derived and necessity measures and denoted by ZZ and N [O, I] are defined as is satisfied. That is, SLIP,,~~ r(w) = 1 must hold. Obviously, condition 17(A) = supr(w). WE/l N(A) = I ~ II(A), where A is the complement It can easily be shown (i) ZZ(W) = I and Z7(8) =O. fl(UiEl Ai) = supit, (ii) Conversely, possibility W E w. of A with respect to W. that the possibility measure satisfies the following conditions: IZ(A,), where I is a (possibly if a possibility measure 17 is given that satisfies infinite) the two properties, index set.” distribution corresponding to 17 can be defined as r(w) then the = n( {w}) for all Just like in probability theory, we can consider to define it is still controversial. the definition of conditional possibility the following possibility [2], In [ 151 is adopted. Given a subset A of W, the conditional distribution. However, how definition distribution is defined as from 1, if r(x) = Z7(A), .x t A, r(xlA) = r(x) 9 if r(x) < ZZ(A), .Y E A, (1) 0, ifx$A. An alternative definition of conditional possibility introduced in [41]. According to this rule, if n(A) #O, we define is by the Dempster’s conditioning rule ’ When W is finite, we can restrict I = { I, 2) and reduce the equation to /I( A U B) = max( I/( A), I7( B)). C.-J.

However, since straightforward, the difference one. Let R denote a possibility induced by rr, the satisfaction distribution of PL is different with the original one proposed by Dubois are technically the difference and prove the two presentations aspect, PL is just the propositional the extension of the base logic C to first order is not essential. The main difference part of PL2 defined logic in is for C. Then a model is thus the semantic for PL2 is just and necessity measures n and N the set of all interpretations r on n. For the possibility is defined by relation where Ifi is now the set of all propositional models of f. If 7r is a PL2 model, then M, = (0, r, V) is a PL model, where V(p) = {w E D 1 w /= p} for all p E PV. Obviously, we have 7~ k f iff Ifl~,, = fi for any PL2 wff f. On the other hand, given a PL model M = (W T, V), we can define Vu as the propositional interpretation associated with 14 E W from the truth assignment V. Then possibility on fi defined as let TM be a distribution %-M(W) = sup{7r(u) / v, = w. I4 t W}, where we assume sup v) = 0 by convention. We can show that /fly = W iff rr,+, k f for any PL wff f.

Of course, the agent’s beliefs on the objective world semantics formulas. is quite facts of a world, so two worlds in the others. From an epistemic it is natural as an agent’s on the worlds. Since an agent may have different views in two to reflect is irrelevance when we are reasoning only about the logic for PL and PL2 are equivalent when we only consider instead of nested beliefs. This to consider a possibility for PL is more general facts, the semantics the same objective the possibilistic the difference distribution is why the semantics Recently, inconsistency WI is added to f1, then fil = fkJ(w~}, + on ai.

However, the basic semantics now, and the general consideration for simplicity, we exhibit only to Section 5.3. will be deferred 2.3.3. Quantitative modal logic Though PL is useful agents, for introspective we may want to represent in reasoning it is not suitable i.e., the agents reasoning about the beliefs of itself. For example, about an agent’s uncertain beliefs, the following sentence about a reflective agent: The agent considers it completely possible that what he believes with half certainty is wrong. The sentence can be represented certainty” is replaced by “complete certainty”. easily in modal logics as 0 (Up A -p) if the term “half By the analogy between necessity operator 0 (respectively as 0) indicated (respectively in [ 161, it is reasonable possibility) measure and the modal the sentence to express in PL. Although these cases, the semantics of PL seems somewhat However, since PL does not allow the nested use of necessity and possibility operators, the syntax of there is no essential difficulty it is illegal PL to cover restrictive. Since only a single possibility to the so-called represented the sentence However, that the wff so the situation described by is unsatisfiable is intuitively since possibility in [ 381. It can be easily checked is associated with a PL model, distribution absolute the semantics corresponds in the absolute semantics, in generalizing distributions semantics possible. though relations just as the accessibility possible worlds, each possible world a possibility semantics of variable distribution [38]. This motivates in modal the agent has different epistemic reflect the epistemic logic do, it is very likely states of some agent, that in different states. Thus, we can associate with Then we can get a kind logic the proposal of quantitative modal independently.

Qualitative possibility logic While PL and QML reason about qualitative logic possibility measures between possibility (QPL) two wffs. the possibility [ 191 concerns mainly and necessity degrees of the wffs, of the relative comparison The syntax of QPL is an extension of a propositional language with a binary connec- tive “a” and the following formation rule: l if f and g are wffs, then f 3 g is also a wff. The wff “f 3 g A -(g 3 f) ” is abbreviated as “f > g”. Although QPL is proposed without accompanied formal semantics, the semantics for QML can be used here, too.

However, neither QML nor QPL have the grees of wffs directly, however two wffs cannot be expressed. Conversely, we cannot express possibility qualitative be meaningful expressive power. It is suggested that each wff in QPL can be translated in a sentence. For example, theory information in QPL.

For the inner translation mapping, let 7; satisfy the following condition: (iv;) T$,(Clf) = T --f T;(f). Let M = (W, R, V) be a d-model, s-model can be easily con- structed as M’ = (W, (<wf)wE~, V), where for all x,y, w E W, x <,+ y iff (w, y) E R.

Furthermore, CO logic only it is apparent allows qualitative wffs. In particular, ,f 3 g in QPL can be written as I? (g > Of), where ; f denotes 6 ,f A Of. An interesting development is that probability can be introduced into a CO model for approaches reasoning is provided to combining qualitative [6].

This may be a combination LCP models and those proposed by Fagin and Halpern distributions serve only in LCP at all. Therefore, reasoning for probabilistic to CO, called MTL* of [ 181. is proposed, In [25], a temporal logic essentially equivalent that in the present or future. f always holds, while Hf means where the modal operators 0 and 0 are replaced by H and 6 respectively.

A comparative structure, as they call it, is just a many-valued CO model written as (W <, V), where < is a ranked relation and V is a truth assignment V : W x PV + 7 with the truth value set 7 = (0, l/n, 2/n,. . , I}.
