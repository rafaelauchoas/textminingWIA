An agent is characterised by a belief state K , andreceives a new item of information α which is to be included among its set of beliefs.Revision then is a function from a belief state and a formula to a new belief state.We propose here a more general framework for belief revision, in which revision is afunction from a belief state and a finite set of formulas to a new belief state. In particular,we distinguish revision by the set {α, β} from the set {α ∧ β}. This seemingly innocuouschange has significant ramifications with respect to iterated belief revision. A problem inapproaches to iterated belief revision is that, after first revising by a formula and then by aformula that is inconsistent with the first formula, all information in the original formulais lost.This problem is avoided here in that, in revising by a set of formulas S, the resulting beliefstate contains not just the information that members of S are believed to be true, butalso the counterfactual supposition that if some members of S were later believed to befalse, then the remaining members would nonetheless still be believed to be true. Thusif some members of S were in fact later believed to be false, then the other elementsof S would still be believed to be true. Hence, we provide a more nuanced approach tobelief revision. The general approach, which we call parallel belief revision, is independentof extant approaches to iterated revision. We present first a basic approach to parallelbelief revision. Following this we combine the basic approach with an approach due to Jinand Thielscher for iterated revision. Postulates and semantic conditions characterising theseapproaches are given, and representation results provided. We conclude with a discussionof the possible ramifications of this approach in belief revision in general.© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionAn agent situated in a sufficiently complex domain will have only incomplete and possibly inaccurate information aboutthat domain. Consequently, such an agent would be expected to receive new information about the domain which it wouldincorporate into its belief corpus. Since new information may conflict with the agent’s accepted beliefs, the agent may alsohave to discard some of its beliefs before the new information can be consistently incorporated. Belief revision is the areaof knowledge representation that addresses how an agent may incorporate new information about a domain into its beliefcorpus. It is generally accepted that there is no single best revision operator, and different agents may have different revisionfunctions. However, revision functions are not arbitrary, but may be considered as being guided or characterised by variousrationality criteria, expressed formally as a set of postulates. The original and best-known set of postulates is called the AGMpostulates [1,16] named after the developers of this framework. As well, several formal constructions of revision functions* Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: jim@cs.sfu.ca (J. Delgrande), yij@cs.sfu.ca (Y.

Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245have been proposed based, for example, on an ordering on sentences of the language or on an ordering on possible states ofthe world. Ideally, a set of postulates is linked with a formal construction by a representation result, showing that a revisionfunction that satisfies a postulate set can be represented by the formal construction, and vice versa.The foundations of AGM revision are well studied and well understood.1 Subsequently, there has been a great deal ofattention paid to iterated belief revision, which addresses logical relations among a sequence of revisions involving possibly-conflicting observations. While there has been much progress in the area of iterated belief revision, virtually all such worksuffers from the following problem: if one revises by a formula and then by a formula that is inconsistent with this formula,then the agent’s beliefs are exactly the same as if only the second revision had taken place.For example, consider the situation where there was a party, but where you have no knowledge about whether Alice (a)or Bob (b) were there. You are subsequently informed by a reliable source that both Alice and Bob went to the party. Thiswould correspond to a revision by a ∧ b, and your resulting belief state would be one in which you believe a ∧ b to betrue. You later learn that Alice in fact did not go to the party. Not only do you now accept ¬a, but in all major approachesto iterated belief revision, including [9,6,32,21], you no longer accept b either. While there may indeed be cases where it’sreasonable to no longer believe Bob was at the party (for example perhaps Bob is Alice’s spouse), this certainly shouldn’tbe a required outcome.This example can be exaggerated to emphasise the point: Consider where an agent initially has no contingent beliefs,and so its beliefs are characterised by the set of tautologies. Next, a substantial body of knowledge, given by the conjunctionp1 ∧ · · · ∧ p1012 , is loaded into the agent’s knowledge base. If we subsequently revise by, say, the negation of p1, then allother knowledge is lost. That is, if the agent’s original (tautological) beliefs were given by K and ∗ is the revision function,we would obtain:(cid:2)(cid:3)K ∗ (p1 ∧ · · · ∧ p1012 )∗ ¬p1 ≡ K ∗ ¬p1.(1)Thus all other information is lost, except for the newly-negated item. Again, this is clearly too strong a condition to imposeon every revision function in all circumstances.We suggest that this problem is appropriately addressed not by modifying the foundations of belief revision, but ratherby providing a more nuanced or expressive approach to revision. Specifically, we propose that the second argument of arevision function be generalised to be a set of formulas. This then distinguishes revision by a set of formulas from revisionby the conjunction of that set of formulas. Consider again our Alice/Bob example, where again at the outset you have nobeliefs about whether either of them attended a party or not, but you are subsequently informed that they both went tothe party. Consequently, if you were now asked “Do you believe that Alice went to the party?”, clearly you would answer inthe affirmative. Assume further that you have no reason to believe that Alice and Bob know each other well, nor have beenin contact; i.e. each individual’s attendance is independent of the other’s. If you were asked “If it were in fact the case thatAlice did not go, would you still believe that Bob went?”, then again you would answer in the affirmative. However, it canbe noted that this last question is a counterfactual query, in that as far as you know the antecedent is false. We are not goingto be concerned with counterfactuals per se in this paper; however, this does have implications for further revisions: If youwere subsequently informed that in fact Alice did not go, then you should in turn continue to believe that Bob went. If, onthe other hand, you had some reason to believe that Alice and Bob’s attendance were linked – for example that they’re acouple – then this would no longer apply.The key point here is that we are treating the propositions A and B as separate items of information. Our central thesisis that revision by a conjunction and revision by the set of conjuncts should be treated differently. If a formula is takenas representing some item of information, then informally a conjunction represents a single item of information, while thecorresponding set of conjuncts represents a collection of items of information. To be sure, the conjunction α ∧ β and theset {α, β} have the same logical content, in that they entail exactly the same formulas. Hence an agent’s contingent beliefsshould be the same regardless of whether a revision is by a conjunction or a corresponding set of formulas. However,as argued above, in revising by a set {α, β} the agent’s resulting belief state should be such that, if there is no knownconnection between α and β, then if β were subsequently learned to be false, then α should still be believed to be true.To this end, we develop an account of belief revision that we call parallel belief revision in which the second argument toa revision function is a finite set of formulas. Thus, if the agent’s belief state is given by K2 and ∗ is a revision function, thenwe distinguish K ∗ {α ∧ β} from K ∗ {α, β}. In the former, revision is by a single formula that happens to be expressed as aconjunction. If a subsequent revision contradicts this formula, then this formula is simply no longer believed. On the otherhand, if the agent views α and β as independent, then it makes sense that α is believed in K ∗ {α, β} ∗ {¬β}, since if oneelement of the input set is contradicted, this need not affect belief in other element. Essentially, for a revision K ∗ {α, β}, theagent comes to believe not only that α and β are contingently true, but also counterfactual assertions such as if β were falsethen α would (where “reasonable”) still be believed to be true. In terminology introduced in the next section, the agent’sbelief state or epistemic state is modified so that such counterfactuals are implicitly believed. Hence, continuing the above1 See [35] for a recent, comprehensive survey of revision in general.2 The distinction between the K of (1) and K is described more fully in the next section. Basically K is the agent’s contingent beliefs concerning thedomain; K is the agent’s full epistemic state, containing not just K but also, for example, information about how the agent’s beliefs would change if itwere to learn a new piece of information.J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452225example, if the agents were told that in fact β were false then it would (again with a caveat, “where reasonable”) continueto believe that α was true. That is, all other things being equal, we would have that α is believed in K ∗ {α, β} ∗ {¬β}.In this paper, we develop approaches to parallel belief revision and show how the aforementioned problems are resolved.Notably, in our approach we obtain that under reasonable assumptions (for example, that α and β are not logically equiv-alent) that α is believed in K ∗ {α, β} ∗ {¬β}. As well, it proves to be the case that parallel belief revision is independentof other accounts of iterated belief revision, in that it can be combined with extant approaches to belief revision. This thensupports the assertion that our approach provides a more fine-grained account of revision, rather than providing an alter-native to existing accounts. Consequently, we first describe the most basic approach to parallel revision, and then show howthis approach can be combined with the approach to iterated revision of Jin and Thielscher [21].The next section reviews the area of belief revision and further motivates our approach. Following this, we give anaccount of the most basic approach to parallel revision. We then combine this approach with that of Jin and Thielscher [21].In each case, postulates characterising the revision function are given, a semantic account is provided, and a representationresult is provided linking the postulates and semantic construction. We conclude with a discussion of wider implicationsof the approach to belief revision as a whole, and iterated revision in particular. Proofs of all formal results are given inAppendix A. An earlier version of this paper appeared in [10].2. Background2.1. Formal preliminariesWe assume a propositional language L generated from a finite set P of atomic propositions. The language is thatof classical propositional logic, and with the classical consequence relation (cid:5). Formulas are denoted by lower-case Greekletters α, β, . . . , while sets of formulas are denoted by upper case Roman letters, A, B, S, . . . . The symbol (cid:6) stands for somearbitrary tautology and ⊥ stands for ¬(cid:6). Cn( A) is the set of logical consequences of A, that is Cn( A) = {α ∈ L | A (cid:5) α}. For a(finite) set of formulas S, ∧S is the conjunction of members of S, ∨S is the corresponding disjunction, and S = {¬α | α ∈ S}.Given two sets of formulas A and B, A + B denotes the expansion of A by B, that is A + B = Cn( A ∪ B). Expansion of a setA by a formula β is defined analogously. Two sentences α and β are logically equivalent, written α ≡ β, iff α (cid:5) β and β (cid:5) α.This extends to sets of sentences by: S1 ≡ S2 iff S1 (cid:5) α for every α ∈ S2 and S2 (cid:5) β for every β ∈ S1. Thus in particular forany finite set of formulas S, we have S ≡ ∧S.A propositional interpretation (also referred to as a possible world) is a mapping from P to {true, false}. The set of allinterpretations is denoted by ΘP . A model of a sentence α is an interpretation w that makes α true according to the usualdefinition of truth, and is denoted by w |(cid:11) α. For W ⊆ ΘP , we also write W |(cid:11) α if w |(cid:11) α for every w ∈ W . For a setof sentences A, Mod( A) is the set of all models of A. For simplicity, Mod({α}) is also written as Mod(α). Conversely, givena set of possible worlds W ⊆ ΘP , we denote by T (W) the set of sentences which are true in all elements of W , that isT (W) = {α ∈ L | w |(cid:11) α for all w ∈ W}.A total preorder (cid:2) is a reflexive, transitive binary relation, such that either w 1 (cid:2) w 2 or w 2 (cid:2) w 1 for every w 1, w 2. Thestrict part of (cid:2) is denoted by ≺, that is, w 1 (cid:2) w 2 and w 2 (cid:14)(cid:2) w 1. We use w 1 = w 2 to abbreviate w 1 (cid:2) w 2 and w 2 (cid:2) w 1.3Given a set S and total preorder (cid:2) defined on members of S, we denote by min(S, (cid:2)) the set of minimal elements of S in (cid:2).2.2. Belief revisionIn the original AGM theory, beliefs of an agent are represented by a belief set, that is, a set of formulas K such thatsuch that α is. Since α may be inconsistent with K , and since it is desirable to maintain consistency if at allK = Cn(K ). Belief revision is modelled as a function from a belief set K and a formula α to a belief set Kbelieved in Kpossible (i.e. if not (cid:5) ¬α), then some formulas may need to dropped from K before α can be consistently added., i.e. α ∈ K(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)The AGM approach also addressed two other operators. The expansion of a belief set K by a formula α has alreadybeen defined in the previous subsection. In contrast to revision and expansion, where an agent gains information, in beliefcontraction the reasoner loses information. The contraction of a belief set K by a formula α, denoted K ˙−α, is a belief setwhere K ˙−α ⊆ K and α /∈ K ˙−α. So in a contraction by α, the agent loses its belief in α while not necessarily believing ¬α.Since our focus in this paper is on revision, we do not consider contraction further, except briefly in Section 2.4, where wereview set-based approaches to contraction that have been proposed in the literature.An important assumption concerning belief revision is that it takes place in an inertial (or static) world, so that theinput is with respect to the same, static world. However, various researchers have argued that, in order to address iteratedbelief revision, it is more appropriate to consider belief states (also called epistemic states) as objects of revision. A beliefstate K effectively encodes information regarding how the revision function itself changes under a revision.4 The belief setcorresponding to belief state K is denoted Bel(K). Formally, a revision operator ∗ maps a belief state K and formula α to arevised belief state K ∗ α. Then, in the spirit of [9], the AGM postulates for revision can be reformulated as follows:3 Relations in a total preorder will be subscripted with an epistemic state, described in the next subsection. In particular, for the last relation we willwrite w 1 =K w 2. Thus there is no confusion with equality, written = as usual.4 This glosses over a number of issues on the nature of a revision function, which need not concern us here. See [36,32] for more on this issue.2226J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245(K ∗ 1) Bel(K ∗ α) = Cn(Bel(K ∗ α)).(K ∗ 2) α ∈ Bel(K ∗ α).(K ∗ 3) Bel(K ∗ α) ⊆ Bel(K) + α.(K ∗ 4) If ¬α /∈ Bel(K) then Bel(K) + α ⊆ Bel(K ∗ α).(K ∗ 5) Bel(K ∗ α) is inconsistent, only if (cid:5) ¬α.(K ∗ 6) If α ≡ β then Bel(K ∗ α) ≡ Bel(K ∗ β).(K ∗ 7) Bel(K ∗ (α ∧ β)) ⊆ Bel(K ∗ α) + β.(K ∗ 8) If ¬β /∈ Bel(K ∗ α) then Bel(K ∗ α) + β ⊆ Bel(K ∗ (α ∧ β)).Thus, the result of revising K by α yields an epistemic state in which α is believed in the corresponding belief set ((K ∗ 1),(K ∗ 2)); whenever the result is consistent, the revised belief set consists of the expansion of Bel(K) by α ((K ∗ 3), (K ∗ 4));the only time that Bel(K) is inconsistent is when α is inconsistent ((K ∗ 5)); and revision is independent of the syntacticform of the formula for revision ((K ∗ 6)). The first six postulates are referred to as the basic revision postulates. The lasttwo postulates are called the supplementary postulates, and deal with the relation between revising by a conjunction andexpansion: whenever consistent, revision by a conjunction corresponds to revision by one conjunct and expansion by theother. Motivation for these postulates can be found in [16,35]. The intent of these postulates is that they should hold forany rational belief revision function. We will call a revision operator an AGM revision operator if it satisfies the reformulatedAGM postulates. Katsuno and Mendelzon [22] have shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for constructing an AGMrevision operator is that any belief state K can induce, as its preferential information, a total preorder on the set of possibleworlds.Definition 1. A faithful assignment is a function that maps each belief state K to a total preorder (cid:2)K on ΘP such that forany w 1, w 2 ∈ ΘP :1. If w 1, w 2 |(cid:11) Bel(K) then w 1 =K w 2.2. If w 1 |(cid:11) Bel(K) and w 2 (cid:14)|(cid:11) Bel(K), then w 1 ≺K w 2.The resulting total preorder is referred to as the faithful ranking corresponding to, or induced by K. Intuitively, w 1 (cid:2)K w 2if w 1 is at least as plausible as w 2, according to the agent. As enforced by the first condition in Definition 1, an agent’sbeliefs are characterised by the least worlds in the ordering.Katsuno and Mendelzon then provide the following representation result, where T (W ) is the set of formulas of classicallogic true in W :Theorem 1. (See [22].) A revision operator ∗ satisfies Postulates (K ∗ 1)–(K ∗ 8) iff there exists a faithful assignment that maps eachbelief set K to a total preorder (cid:2)K such thatK ∗ φ = T(cid:2)(cid:2)Mod(φ), (cid:2)K(cid:3)(cid:3).minThus for a belief state K, the agent’s beliefs following revision by a formula α are characterised by those possible worldsof φ that are most plausible according to the agent. A ranking function (cid:2)K corresponding to belief state K can also beunderstood as specifying the (counterfactual) information of what the agent would believe after coming to believe someformula φ.2.3. Iterated belief revisionThe AGM postulates do not address properties of iterated belief revision. This can be seen by observing that, whileTheorem 1 specifies what the agent’s beliefs will be following a revision by formula φ, it has nothing to say about whatthe new ranking function (cid:2)K∗φ should look like. As noted by [32], the only interesting result that follows from the AGMapproach concerning iterated belief revision is the following:If ¬β /∈ Bel(K ∗ α)then Bel(cid:2)(K ∗ α) ∗ β(cid:3)= Bel(cid:2)(cid:3)K ∗ (α ∧ β).This has led to the development of extensions of the AGM approach to address iterated revision; the best-known approachis that of Darwiche and Pearl [9] (DP). They propose the following postulates, adapted according to our notation:(C1) If β (cid:5) α, then Bel((K ∗ α) ∗ β) = Bel(K ∗ β).(C2) If β (cid:5) ¬α, then Bel((K ∗ α) ∗ β) = Bel(K ∗ β).(C3) If α ∈ Bel(K ∗ β), then α ∈ Bel((K ∗ α) ∗ β).(C4) If ¬α /∈ Bel(K ∗ β), then ¬α /∈ Bel((K ∗ α) ∗ β).J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452227(C1) states that if an agent revises by a formula and then by a logically stronger formula then, with respect to its beliefset, this is no different than simply revising by the stronger formula. The other postulates may be given similar informalreadings. As with the AGM postulates, the intent is that these postulates should hold for any rational belief revision function.Darwiche and Pearl show that an AGM revision operator satisfies Postulates (C1)–(C4) iff the way it revises faithful rankingssatisfies the (respective) conditions:(CR1) If w 1, w 2 |(cid:11) α, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 iff w 1 (cid:2)K∗α w 2.(CR2) If w 1, w 2 (cid:14)|(cid:11) α, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 iff w 1 (cid:2)K∗α w 2.(CR3) If w 1 |(cid:11) α and w 2 (cid:14)|(cid:11) α, then w 1 ≺K w 2 implies w 1 ≺K∗α w 2.(CR4) If w 1 |(cid:11) α and w 2 (cid:14)|(cid:11) α, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 implies w 1 (cid:2)K∗α w 2.These conditions are natural and appealing; moreover they appear to be intuitively very reasonable: When K is revisedby α, Conditions (CR1) and (CR2) require that the relative ranking of any two α-worlds (resp. ¬α-worlds) do not change.Conditions (CR3) and (CR4) require that if an α-world w 1 is (strictly) more plausible than a ¬α-world w 2, then followingrevision by α, w 1 continues to be (strictly) more plausible than w 2.The DP postulates have been criticised in two respects. On one hand, it has been suggested that they are too permissive,in that they support revision operators which allow arbitrary dependencies among the items of information which an agentacquires along the way. Consequently, Jin and Thielscher [21] have proposed the so-called postulate of independence5:(Ind) If ¬α /∈ Bel(K ∗ β) then α ∈ Bel((K ∗ α) ∗ β).Thus, if a revision of K by β does not rule out α, then if K is first revised by α and then by β, α is believed in theresulting belief set. Postulate (Ind) strengthens both (C3) and (C4). Thus, the suggested set of postulates according to Jinand Thielscher [21] consists of (C1), (C2), and (Ind). They also give a necessary and sufficient condition for an AGM revisionoperator to satisfy (Ind):(IndR) If w 1 |(cid:11) α and w 2 |(cid:11) ¬α, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 implies w 1 ≺K∗α w 2.This condition is also natural: if α is true at w 1 and false at w 2, and if w 1 and w 2 are equally plausible, then after revisingby α, w 1 is strictly more plausible than w 2. If w 1 ≺K w 2 then we simply have (CR3).On the other hand, it can be argued that the DP postulates are too strong. In particular, Postulate (C2) has been notedby many researchers as producing the undesirable result described in Section 1 [28,23,11]. As a further example, consider ascenario proposed by Konieczny and Pino Pérez [23]:Example 1. Suppose an electric circuit contains an adder and a multiplier. The atomic propositions a and m denote re-spectively that the adder and the multiplier are working. Initially we have no information about this circuit; and we thenlearn that the adder and the multiplier are working (α = a ∧ m). Thereafter, someone tells us that the adder is actually notworking (β = ¬a).As argued in [23], there is no reason to “forget” that the multiplier is working; however by (C2) we must have (K ∗ α) ∗β = K ∗ β, since β (cid:5) ¬α. Hence, in this case (C2) appears to be too strong.Intuitively, such examples are compelling. However, the case against (C2) isn’t clear cut. First, it can be observed thatmany researchers (e.g., [28,23]), who are against (C2) are nonetheless quite happy with Postulate (C1). However, the seman-tic characterisation of Postulate (C2) (viz. (CR2)) seems as reasonable as that of (C1) (viz. (CR1)): If being informed about αdoes not change the relative plausibility of α-worlds, why should the relative ordering of ¬α-worlds be changed? This ideais also articulated in [37], which argues that in a belief change involving α, the relative ordering between α-worlds remainsunchanged, as it does between ¬α-worlds.As an informal defense of (C2), it can be observed that in Example 1 it is implicitly assumed that a and m are separateitems of information. However, in the AGM approach, a simultaneous revision by a and m can only be represented by aconjunction, viz. K ∗ (a ∧ b). What makes Example 1 credible is the fact that there is no apparent relation between beinginformed of the adder working and, at the same time, of the multiplier working. Hence learning ¬a would seem to notinfluence belief in m. However, the example can be elaborated upon so that this isn’t necessarily the case. Consider forexample where we are told by someone that both the adder and multiplier are working, and then determine ourselves thatthe adder is not working. One might argue plausibly that the original source was suspect, and so it makes sense to give upin toto all information provided by that source. Thus plausibly in this case one might want to not believe that m was true.65 Essentially the same system is discussed in [5], where it is called admissable revision.6 Another support for (C2) is that it is in fact the only DP postulate which puts additional constraints on the retention of propositional beliefs. To seethis, let’s consider so-called amnesic revision ∗a :(cid:4)K ∗a α =K + α if K (cid:2) ¬α,Cn(α)otherwise.Note that radical as it is, amnesic revision satisfies the AGM postulates, (C1), (C3) and (C4), but violates (C2).2228J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245This discussion shows that a revision of a belief state K by formulas α and β can be interpreted in at least two differentways. In the first interpretation, the agent has been informed that α and β are true; to revise simultaneously by α and β,the best that can be done is to revise by their conjunction. In the second interpretation, the agent has been informed of anitem of information, and this item of information has been expressed as a conjunction. Under the first interpretation, α andβ are regarded as separate items of information; under this interpretation it is reasonable that (C2) not necessarily hold.Under the second interpretation, α and β are seen as components of an item of information; here it seems reasonable that(C2) does hold. Clearly, extant accounts of iterated belief revision are not sufficiently expressive to deal with both situations.Thus, Example 1 doesn’t provide a counterexample to (C2), so much as it highlights the limitations of the expressibilityof revision functions. What this suggests then is that AGM revision should be generalised so that both above-mentionedsituations can be handled.2.4. Conjunctions of formulas vs. sets of formulasThe preceding discussion suggests that K ∗ (α ∧ β) should be treated differently from K ∗ {α, β}. The former case repre-sents the situation in the AGM framework in which revision is by a formula, here comprised of two conjuncts. In the lattercase, revision is by a set of formulas. An immediate effect of this distinction is that revision now becomes a function whosesecond argument is a set of formulas, rather than a single formula. Hence the above distinction is appropriately expressedas K ∗ {α ∧ β} vs. K ∗ {α, β}.This distinction between a set of formulas and their conjunction has been noted and explored elsewhere and underdifferent guises. Perhaps the most direct recognition of this distinction is in [24]. There the comma that appears in anexpression of a set of objects is referred to as “the forgotten connective”. Their interests however concern reasoning underinconsistency, where one can plausibly make the argument that there are cases where a distinction between {a ∧ b ∧ ¬b}and {a, b, ¬b} is of value.As well, the distinction between a set of formulas and their conjunction has cropped up in nonmonotonic reason-ing, specifically with respect to nonmonotonic inference relations, conditional logics, and related systems (see [25,26,7] formonotonic systems of defaults, and [33,8,2,29] for nonmonotonic approaches). In these systems, a default “if α then nor-mally β” can be written α ⇒ β in a conditional logic or α |∼ β in a nonmonotonic inference relation. There is a difficultywith such approaches, in that for defaults α ⇒ β1 and α ⇒ β2 if α is known to be contingently true while β1 is false, onewould still want to conclude β2 by default. Similarly, if α is known to be contingently true, where |(cid:11) α ⇒ γ and γ ⇒ βis a default, one would want to conclude β by default in general. However these results are difficult to obtain. These is-sues have been addressed in several ways, but solutions in general have relied on how a default is represented. In [17],possible worlds are ranked according to the defaults that they violate. In the approach of [18], maximum entropy is usedto essentially assert that things are as normal as possible. The lexicographic closure of a set of defaults [27,4] formalises theidea that in applying defaults, one prefers to violate a smaller number of defaults to violating a larger number. All theseapproaches are syntax dependent, in that they depend on how a set of defaults is represented. In particular, one may ob-tain different answers for the set of defaults {α ⇒ β1, α ⇒ β2} as opposed to {α ⇒ (β1 ∧ β2)}: if β1 is false, then in theformer case one may still conclude β2 whereas in the latter case the default as a whole is inapplicable. So, roughly, theintuition underlying the lexicographic closure is that as many defaults are applied as consistently possible, and the resultsof this notion of maximum applicability will vary depending on how the defaults are expressed. The focus in the approachpresented here is somewhat different: one revises by a set of formulas S, and this set is accepted. (In particular, if S isinconsistent then the agent falls into an inconsistent belief state.) If the agent subsequently learns that some elementsof S are in fact false then, where consistent, the remaining elements of S are still believed to be true. So for two sets of, the agent’s beliefs will be the same in K ∗ S and K ∗ S, but may differ in subsequentformulas S and Srevisions.where S ≡ S(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)With respect to belief change, a belief base [20] is a set of formulas representing an agent’s beliefs. Since a belief base isin general not deductively closed, it may be seen as having more structure than the corresponding belief set. Hence beliefchange with respect to a belief base may have differing results, depending on how the agent’s beliefs are expressed. Forexample, [30] considers a scenario in which the agent’s beliefs are represented by an infobase consisting of a finite sequenceof formulas. Each formula in the infobase is assumed to be an explicit piece of information, obtained independently fromthe other formulas. For contraction, an ordering is specified over interpretations depending on the number of formulasin the infobase that they satisfy. Hence if two formulas in an infobase were replaced by their conjunction, one wouldexpect quite different results. Somewhat similar intuitions are employed for disjunctive maxi-adjustment [3]; see also [39]. Anordered knowledge base is employed toward conflict resolution, for application to tasks such as belief change and informationintegration. An ordered knowledge base places a ranking on formulas, which can be seen as a compact representation ofan ordinal conditional function [37]. Interpretations are ranked by the highest formula that they falsify (and given rank 0if all formulas are satisfied). The disjunctive maxi-adjustment is shown to satisfy a lexicographic strategy, which is to say,essentially a maximal set of formulas for a given rank is selected. Since one is working at the level of formulas, again resultsdepend on how the formulas are represented.The preceding approaches to belief change consider a knowledge base as being comprised of a set of (possibly ranked)formulas. There has also been work in which the input for belief change is a set of formulas, rather than a single formula.Fuhrmann and Hansson [15] survey multiple contraction; in particular they propose package contraction, which is concernedJ. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452229with removing a set of formulas from a belief set. In the AGM approach, a contraction K − α yields a belief set Kthatis a subset of K in which α is not believed (except in the case where α is a tautology). The standard construction forcontraction is phrased in terms of remainder sets, or maximal subsets of K that fail to imply α. In a package contractionsuch as K − {α, β}, the resulting belief set is one in which neither α nor β is believed. The notion of remainder setextends naturally in this case to maximal subsets of K that fail to imply either α or β. It can be noted that the packagecontraction K − {α, β} is distinct from contraction K − (α ∧ β) or K − (α ∨ β). In the former case, it is possible thatα ∈ K − (α ∧ β) although this is not allowed in the corresponding package contraction. For the latter case, it is possiblethat α ∨ β ∈ K − {α, β}, although clearly α ∨ β /∈ K − (α ∨ β). Fuhrmann and Hansson [15] also give a set of postulates forpackage contraction analogous to the set of basic postulates for AGM contraction, and they prove a representation resultlinking these postulates to the semantic construction.(cid:15)The multiple contraction in [42] also studies how to contract a belief set so that it is consistent with a set of formulas. Inthis work, the authors propose supplementary postulates for multiple contraction and provide a representation result; theyalso consider the case where the set for contraction may be infinite. In other work, Fermé et al. [14] examine a constructionfor multiple contraction in a (nondeductively-closed) belief base, while Falappa et al. [13] address revision of an arbitraryset of formulas by a set of explanations, with application to argumentation systems. Last, Delgrande and Wassermann [12]consider package contraction where the underlying logic is that governing Horn clauses. Here package contraction is ofgreater importance than in the case of classical logic, since in classical logic one has the option of contracting by severalformulas via contracting their disjunction. However, the disjunction of Horn clauses in general is not Horn, and so onerequires package contraction to concurrently remove several formulas.It can be noted that while these approaches to set-based contraction have a syntactic resemblance to the approachdeveloped here, the emphasis is quite different. In a package or multiple contraction K − S, the resulting belief set ingeneral is different from a contraction made up of some Boolean combination of members of S. On the other hand, noneof these approaches address iterated operations. In contrast, in our approach it will be seen that the belief set resultingfrom K ⊗ S and from K ⊗ {∧S} will be the same. However the faithful rankings resulting from K ⊗ S and K ⊗ {∧S} will ingeneral be quite different, and this will have significant ramifications for iterated revision.There has also been work in revision by sets of formulas, in particular the set revision of [41] and multiple revision of [34].There are two main differences between these approaches and our’s. First, our focus is on iterated revision and, in particular,constraints that need to be imposed on an agent’s underlying epistemic state in order to effect plausible revisions. Second,Zhang and Foo [41] and Peppas [34] primarily study infinite sets. In our approach, the focus is on the distinction betweenrevising by a finite set of formulas and a corresponding conjunction of those formulas. Therefore, while set revision ormultiple revision might be useful for investigating infinite nonmonotonic reasoning, arguably our approach is more suitablefor modelling the evolution of an agent’s belief state where, at least in a practical setting, an agent will not receive aninfinite set as input. Finally, Nayak [31] anticipates some of the properties of parallel revision, in an approach where boththe belief state and input are represented by epistemic entrenchment relations.3. Parallel revision3.1. IntuitionsWe have argued that K ∗ {α ∧ β} should be treated differently from K ∗ {α, β}. Hence the epistemic state resulting fromK ∗ {α ∧ β} will in general be different from that resulting from K ∗ {α, β}. However, the logical content of {α ∧ β} and{α, β} is the same, and so one might reasonably expect that the agent’s beliefs following revision by either of these setswould be the same. Thus one might reasonably expect that(cid:2)BelK ∗ {α, β}(cid:3)(cid:2)K ∗ {α ∧ β}(cid:3).= BelOn the right-hand side of the equality we revise by a single item of information, α ∧ β. If β is later shown to be false,then so too is α ∧ β, and it is reasonable that all original information (including α) may be lost. Hence, possibly α /∈Bel(K ∗ {α ∧ β} ∗ {¬β}). This argument doesn’t apply to Bel(K ∗ {α, β}), where we revise by a set consisting of two items ofinformation. Thus if we later revise by ¬β, then one would expect that α ∈ Bel(K ∗ {α, β} ∗ {¬β}) where “reasonable”.7Semantically, this has the following ramifications. An agent’s belief state (at least as far as revision is concerned) ismodelled by a faithful ranking on possible worlds. In the faithful ranking that results from the revision K ∗ {α, β}, we havethat the least α ∧ β worlds are ranked lower than the least ¬(α ∧ β) worlds in (cid:2)K∗{α,β}. (This is a trivial consequence of thefact that the least α ∧ β worlds are minimal in (cid:2)K∗{α,β}.) The key intuition in parallel revision is that these considerationsextend to subsets of the set of formulas for revision. Hence, in revising by {α, β}, α and β are accepted as being true.However, implicit in the revision is the (counterfactual) notion that if β were found to not be true then α would still beheld to be true. Semantically, this means that, among the ¬β worlds, the least α worlds are ranked below the least ¬αworlds. This then would have the effect that if β were later determined to be false, thus necessitating a revision by ¬β,7 A case that is not “reasonable” is where β is of the form α ∨ γ . Then K ∗ {α, β} is the same as K ∗ {α, α ∨ γ }, and clearly one requires thatα /∈ Bel(K ∗ {α, α ∨ γ } ∗ {¬(α ∨ γ )}).2230J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245(cid:15)(cid:15)then α would still be believed to be true. These considerations extend straightforwardly to arbitrary (but finite) sets offormulas. Thus, for a set of formulas S, after the revision K ∗ S all elements of S will be believed. Implicit in the resultingranking function is the counterfactual notion that if the members of some subset of S, say S, were found to be false, thenS \ Swill continue to bebelieved.would still be believed to be true. This then has the effect that in K ∗ S ∗ S(cid:15), members of S \ SAnother way of thinking of the underlying procedure is that in a revision K ∗ S, subsets of S implicitly define a contextthat provides additional structure in the resulting ranking function. That is, in K ∗ S, the minimal S worlds are ranked below(cid:15) ⊂ S, in the “context” of S(cid:15) the same considerations apply. Thus, in the restriction of the rankingall ¬(∧S) worlds. For Sfunction to S(cid:15) worlds, the minimal S \ Sworlds are ranked below all ¬(∧(S \ S(cid:15))) worlds.Essentially then, for a revision K ∗ S, changes to the underlying ranking on worlds will depend not just on the set S,but also on subsets of S. The intuition is that, in revising by S, all elements of S are believed; if some members of S aresubsequently disbelieved then, insofar as possible, the remaining members of S are still believed. In the next section weformalise this intuition. The approach is independent of previous approaches to iterated revision, in that it can be combinedwith an existing approach to iterated revision to yield a “parallel” hybrid of that approach. Consequently, in the followingsection we combine the basic approach with that of [21] to yield what we suggest is the appropriate general model foriterated belief revision.(cid:15)(cid:15)3.2. The basic approachThis section describes the basic approach to parallel revision, in which new information for revision is represented by afinite set of formulas. The intuition is that each formula of the set represents an undecomposable (with regards to revision)piece of information. To distinguish this from standard belief revision, we denote a parallel revision operator by ⊗. Formally,⊗ maps a belief state K and finite set of formulas S to a revised belief state K ⊗ S. We assume henceforth that the secondargument to ⊗ is a finite, nonempty8 set of formulas.To begin, we adapt the AGM postulates for revision by a set of formulas. The following are analogous to postulates givenin [34], adapted for belief states:(K ⊗ 1) Cn(Bel(K ⊗ S)) = Bel(K ⊗ S).(K ⊗ 2) S ⊆ Bel(K ⊗ S).(K ⊗ 3) Bel(K ⊗ S) ⊆ Bel(K) + S.(K ⊗ 4)(K ⊗ 5) Bel(K ⊗ S) is inconsistent iff S is inconsistent.(K ⊗ 6)(K ⊗ 7) Bel(K ⊗ (S1 ∪ S2)) ⊆ Bel(K ⊗ S1) + S2.(K ⊗ 8)If S1 ≡ S2, then Bel(K ⊗ S1) = Bel(K ⊗ S2).If Bel(K) ∪ S is consistent, then Bel(K) + S ⊆ Bel(K ⊗ S).If Bel(K ⊗ S1) ∪ S2 is consistent, then Bel(K ⊗ S1) + S2 ⊆ Bel(K ⊗ (S1 ∪ S2)).Note that (K ⊗ 6) yields Bel(K ⊗ S) = Bel(K ⊗ {∧S}). With a slight abuse of terminology, we will also refer to revisionoperators that satisfy the above postulates as AGM revision operators.It has been shown in [34] that the representation theorem of Grove [19] can be generalised to revision by a set offormulas. Given that we deal with a finite language, the systems of spheres of Grove’s construction are interdefinable withfaithful rankings, and so the representation theorem of [22] can also be generalised:A revision operator ⊗ satisfies (K ⊗ 1)–(K ⊗ 8) iff there exists a faithful ranking (cid:2)K for an arbitrary belief state K, suchthat for any set of sentences S:Bel(K ⊗ S) = T(cid:2)(cid:2)minMod(S), (cid:2)K(cid:3)(cid:3).(2)For the basic approach to parallel revision, we give two postulates and semantic conditions that characterise the ap-proach.The following postulates characterise the basic approach to parallel revision:⊗(P) For S1 ⊂ S, where S1 ∪ (S \ S1) (cid:2) ⊥,S1 ⊆ Bel(cid:2)(cid:3)K ⊗ S ⊗ (S \ S1).8 This differs from [10], which allowed the empty set, but is in agreement with [34]. There are several reasons for this change. Foremost, it is not clearthat revision by the empty set is a meaningful operation, since K ∗ ∅ would seem to have the informal interpretation of revising in the absence of a reportof information. Second, it eases the technical development. Last, while revision by ∅ could be equated most naturally with revision by {(cid:6)}, the resultingrevision K ∗ {(cid:6)} isn’t entirely trivial, since in the case that Bel(K) is inconsistent (K ∗ 5) stipulates that the revision by the empty set is sufficient to extractan agent from the inconsistent belief state.⊗(S) For S1 ⊂ S,(cid:2)BelK ⊗J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452231(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)S1 ∪ (S \ S1)(cid:2)= BelK ⊗ S ⊗(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)S1 ∪ (S \ S1).⊗) is a postulate of success preservation. It asserts that for a revision of K by S, a subset S 1 ⊂ S is preserved in revising(Pby the negations of members of S \ S1 whenever it is consistent to do so. This reflects the intuition that, in revising by Sand after which some members of S are subsequently disbelieved, then insofar as possible the remaining members of S are) expresses the fact that for set S and subset S1 ⊂ S, revising by S1 ∪ (S \ S1) yields the same beliefs asstill believed. (Sfirst revising by S and then by S1 ∪ (S \ S1). Thus it expresses a condition of conservativism with respect to iterated belief.⊗These postulates can be combined as follows:⊗(PP) Let S1 ⊂ S where S1 ∪ (S \ S1) (cid:2) ⊥.Then Bel(K ⊗ S ⊗ (S \ S1)) = Bel(K ⊗ (S1 ∪ (S \ S1))).Thus revising by a set S and then the negations of some members of S yields the same belief set as revising by thenegations of these members in S together with the remaining members of S.We obtain the following result:Proposition 1. Suppose ⊗ is a revision operator satisfying Postulates (K ⊗ 1)–(K ⊗ 8). Then ⊗ satisfies (PP(P⊗) and (S⊗).⊗) if and only if it satisfiesIn order to justify the Postulates (P), we turn next to the corresponding conditions on faithful orderings.From a semantic point of view, consider the following condition on a faithful ranking (cid:2)K⊗S defined in terms of a faithfulranking (cid:2)K:) and (S⊗⊗⊗(PR) Let S1 ⊂ S where S1 ∪ (S \ S1) (cid:2) ⊥. Then(cid:2)minMod(S \ S1), (cid:2)K⊗S(cid:3)⊆ Mod(S1).⊗(SR) Let S1 ⊂ S. Then(cid:2)Mod(cid:2)min(cid:3)S1 ∪ (S \ S1), (cid:2)K(cid:3)(cid:2)= min(cid:2)ModS1 ∪ (S \ S1)(cid:3), (cid:2)K⊗S(cid:3).Unsurprisingly, these conditions can also be combined into the single condition:⊗(PPR) Let S1 ⊂ S where S1 ∪ (S \ S1) (cid:2) ⊥. Then(cid:2)Mod(S \ S1), (cid:2)K⊗S(cid:3)S1 ∪ (S \ S1)(cid:2)Mod(cid:2)min= min, (cid:2)K(cid:3)(cid:3).Thus, informally, for S1 ⊂ S, the minimum S1 ∪ (S \ S1) worlds in a faithful ranking are just the minimum (S \ S1)worlds following revision by S. This in turn means that following revision by S, S 1 will be true at the least (S \ S1) worlds,as desired.Proposition 2. Suppose (cid:2)K is a faithful ranking. Then (cid:2)K satisfies (PP⊗R) if and only if it satisfies (P⊗R) and (S⊗R).For illustration, consider the following examples:Example 2. Let P = {a, b}, and let the agent’s faithful ranking be given as follows:{ab} ≺K {ab} ≺K {ab} ≺K {ab}.Thus Bel(K) = Cn(a ∧ ¬b). There are three possible faithful rankings resulting from K ⊗ {a, b} = K(cid:15):{ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab},{ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab},{ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab, ab} ≺K(cid:15) {ab}.This example is very simple. In fact it can be observed in the example that, since the possible worlds correspond tosubsets of {a, b}, the possible outcomes are independent of the initial belief state K. The next example is a little morecomplicated.2232J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245Example 3. Let P = {a, b, c}, and let the agent’s faithful ranking be given as follows:{abc, abc} ≺K {abc, abc, abc} ≺K {abc, abc, abc}.For K ⊗ {a, b} = K(cid:15), three possible faithful rankings are as follows:{abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc},{abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc, abc, abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc},{abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc, abc, abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc} ≺K(cid:15) {abc}.. First, for any S1 ⊆ S = {a, b}, the minimum S1 ∪ (S \ S1) worlds are the same in K and K(cid:15)Thus Bel(K) = Cn(a ∧ ¬b) and Bel(K(cid:15)) = Cn(a ∧ b ∧ c). Two properties can be observed for each of the example rankingsfor K(cid:15). Thus the minimum {a, b}worlds in each case is given by {abc}, and the minimum {a, ¬b} worlds is given by {abc, abc}. Second, for any S 2 ⊂ S1 ⊆S = {a, b}, the minimum S1 ∪ (S \ S1) worlds are ranked strictly lower than the minimum S2 ∪ (S \ S2) worlds. Hence, theminimum {a, b} worlds are ranked strictly lower than the minimum {a, ¬b} and {¬a, b} worlds, and these latter sets arestrictly lower than the minimum {¬a, ¬b} worlds.Otherwise, for the three rankings given in the example, the first is not particularly special one way or another. Thesecond, in a sense, is the most compact possible ranking, in that worlds are positioned as low in the ranking as possible.The third ranking has the property that for S2 ⊂ S1 ⊆ S, every S1 ∪ (S \ S1) world is ranked below every S2 ∪ (S \ S2) world.This last example can be seen as extending the approach of Nayak et al. [32] or Jin and Thielscher [21] to apply to subsetsof a set for revision; we develop this latter point in Section 4 with regards to [21].The next result expresses basic properties of faithful rankings that satisfy (PR) and (SR).⊗⊗Proposition 3. Let K be a belief state and let (cid:2)K be the faithful ranking induced by K. Let ⊗ revise faithful rankings corresponding toan AGM revision operator, and let (cid:2)K⊗S be a faithful ranking satisfying (PR) and (SR).⊗⊗1. Let S1 ⊂ S be such that S1 ∪ (S \ S1) is consistent.Then min(Mod(S \ S1), (cid:2)K⊗S ) = min(Mod(S1 ∪ (S \ S1)), (cid:2)K⊗S ).2. Let S2 ⊂ S1 ⊂ S and S2 (cid:2) S1.If w 1 ∈ min(Mod(S \ S1), (cid:2)K⊗S ) and w 2 ∈ min(Mod(S \ S2), (cid:2)K⊗S ) then w 1 ≺K⊗S w 2.The first part expresses the fundamental intuition underlying the approach: after revising by a set of formulas S, inthe resulting faithful ordering restricted to (S \ S1) worlds, the least S1 worlds will be ranked lower than any world inwhich S1 isn’t true. The second part expresses another fundamental property of the approach, that after revising by a set S,for S2 ⊂ S1 ⊂ S, the minimum (S \ S1) worlds are ranked below the minimum (S \ S2) worlds. Both parts refer to thefaithful ranking corresponding to K ⊗ S. Together they can be thought of as expressing a relation among conditional (orcounterfactual) beliefs; that is, after revising by S, the faithful ranking given by K ⊗ S reflects the counterfactual assertionthat if some members of S were determined to be false, the remaining elements of S would still be believed to be true.Hence if a revision by S were in fact followed by a revision wherein some members of S were asserted to be false, theremaining elements of S would be believed to be true.We obtain the representation result:Theorem 2. Let ⊗ be a revision operator satisfying Postulates (K ⊗ 1)–(K ⊗ 8).1. ⊗ satisfies (P2. ⊗ satisfies (S⊗) iff it revises faithful rankings according to (P⊗⊗) iff it revises faithful rankings according to (S⊗R).R).An AGM revision operator that satisfies Postulates (PWe have shown that in revising by a set of formulas S, and then revising by the negations of some subset S) will be referred to as a (basic) parallel revision operator.of S, thatthe remaining members of S will continue to be believed. The next result shows that if we revise by a set of formulas S,and then revise where some formulas of a subset Sof S are false (but it is not necessarily known which), then the otherformulas in S will continue to be believed. This result is more or less a corollary to the factoring result in AGM revision inthe context of parallel revision.) and (S(cid:15)(cid:15)⊗⊗Proposition 4. Let ⊗ be a basic parallel revision operator and let S1 ⊂ S.Then S1 ⊆ Bel(K ⊗ S ⊗ {∨(S \ S1)}).Thus, if all we know is that some members of S \ S1 are false, then S1 will still be believed after revising by S followedby ∨(S \ S1).J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452233Some examples will make the properties and ramifications of the approach clear. Throughout the following examples,K will be some belief state and S will be a set of formulas. α, β, γ will be logically independent formulas, that is, forφ1, φ2 ∈ {α, β, γ } if φ1 (cid:5) φ2 then φ1 = φ2.The first example considers the situation where the elements of the set for revision are independent.Example 4. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {α, β, γ }.We get that in a faithful ranking resulting from the revision (cid:2)K⊗S , the least {α, β, γ } worlds are strictly less than theleast {α, β, ¬γ } worlds, which in turn are strictly less than the least {α, ¬β, ¬γ } worlds.Consequently we obtain:(cid:2)(cid:2)α ∧ γ ∈ Belα ∈ Belα ∈ BelK ⊗ {α, β, γ } ⊗ {¬β}K ⊗ {α, β, γ } ⊗ {¬β, ¬γ },(cid:3)K ⊗ {α, β, γ } ⊗ {¬β ∨ ¬γ }.(cid:2)(cid:3),(cid:3)The first two parts illustrate the basic property of the approach in the case of logically independent formulas: thatrevising by a set of formulas, then by the negation of some members of the set leaves the remaining elements still in theagent’s belief set. The last part illustrates the result given in Proposition 4.In the next example, the elements of the set for revision are not independent.Example 5. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {α, α ∧ β, γ }.We obtain:(cid:2)α ∧ γ ∈ Belγ ∈ Bel(cid:2)K ⊗ {α, α ∧ β, γ } ⊗ {¬β}K ⊗ {α, α ∧ β, γ } ⊗ {¬α}(cid:3),(cid:3).On the other hand, there are resulting faithful rankings in which(cid:2)β /∈ BelK ⊗ {α, α ∧ β, γ } ⊗ {¬α}(cid:3).In the first case, since β is believed to be false, then α ∧ β must certainly also be false. On the other hand, the otherelements of the set, α and γ continue to be believed after revision by ¬β. Similarly in the second part, if α is false, thenγ can continue to be believed.The following two examples illustrate a very interesting phenomenon, that the approach can be used to express a pref-erence over which formulas are accepted.Example 6. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {α, α ∧ β}.With respect to the agent’s contingent beliefs, revision by {α, α ∧ β} is of course the same as revision by {α ∧ β}.However, we also obtain:(cid:2)α ∈ BelK ⊗ {α, α ∧ β} ⊗ {¬α ∨ ¬β}(cid:3).That is, in revising by {α, α ∧ β}, we effectively encode the preference that if one of α or β are to be subsequentlygiven up, then β will be given up and α retained. In terms of faithful rankings, we have the following. After revising K byS = {α, α ∧ β}, at the minimum worlds in the resulting ranking, {α, α ∧ β} will be true. For subsets S 1 of S, we must have⊗that S1 ∪ (S \ S1) is consistent. This will be the case for S1 = {α} and (PPR) stipulates that the minimum ¬α ∨ ¬β worldsin the ranking associated with K ⊗ S is the same as the minimum {α} ∪ {(α ∧ β)} = {α ∧ ¬β} worlds associated with K.Hence in revising by S and then {¬α ∨ ¬β}, we get that {α ∧ ¬β} is true in the resulting belief set.Example 7. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {α, α ∨ β}.equivalent to that of {α}.Clearly, for atoms α, β, we don’t generally obtain that β ∈ Bel(K ⊗ {α, α ∨ β}), since the logical content of {α, α ∨ β} isHowever, we do obtain:(cid:2)β ∈ BelK ⊗ {α, α ∨ β} ⊗ {¬α}(cid:3).Thus, after revising by {α, α ∨ β} we don’t necessarily believe that β is true; however we do believe that β is true onsubsequently revising by {¬α}. This result, on reflection, is to be expected: In revising by a set, if one of the elements of the2234J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–2245set is found later to be false then, where consistently possible, the remaining elements of the set would still be believed.Thus in revising by {α, α ∨ β}, if α were subsequently determined to be false then the remaining element, viz. α ∨ β wouldremain true. But since α is now believed false, this requires that β is now believed to be true. Thus in this case in revisingby {α, α ∨ β}, a preference is established between α and β, to the effect of “accept α, but if it is subsequently found to befalse, accept β”.The next two examples deal with revising by a set of formulas where the set is inconsistent. In the first case, individualelements of the set are consistent; in the second, some member of the set is inconsistent. In both cases, we obtain desirableresults in subsequent revisions. This illustrates that, even though revision by an inconsistent set is defined to yield aninconsistent belief set, the underlying faithful ranking nonetheless retains nontrivial information about the agent’s beliefstate.Example 8. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {α, ¬α, β, γ }.Obviously Bel(K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β, γ }) is inconsistent. However we obtain the following:(cid:3),K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β, γ } ⊗ {α}(cid:2)(cid:2)β ∧ γ ∈ Bel⊥ /∈ Belβ ∧ γ ∈ Belγ ∈ Bel(cid:2)(cid:2)K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β, γ } ⊗ {α},K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β, γ } ⊗ {α ∨ ¬α}(cid:3),K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β, γ } ⊗ {¬β}.(cid:3)(cid:3)Analogous results obtain when an element of the set for revision is inconsistent.Example 9. Consider K ⊗ S where S = {⊥, α, β}.We obtain:(cid:2)β ∈ Bel(cid:3)(cid:2)K ⊗ {⊥, α, β} ⊗ {α},(cid:3)K ⊗ {⊥, α, β} ⊗ {¬α}(cid:2)(cid:3)K ⊗ {⊥, α, β} ⊗ {α}.,β ∈ Bel⊥ /∈ Bel4. Parallel revision and iterated revisionThe basic approach only deals with limited situations where we first revise by a set of formulas then by the negations ofsome of these formulas. In this section, we extend the basic approach to deal with more general cases. We first show thatthe straightforward generalisation of the well-known iterated revision postulates are problematic and insufficient. Then, wepresent a postulate of evidence retainment, which offers an alternative that avoids these difficulties.We start with the following generalisation of the DP postulates to sets of formulas, as suggested by [40]:⊗⊗⊗⊗(C1(C2(C3(C4) If S2 (cid:5) S1, then Bel((K ⊗ S1) ⊗ S2) = Bel(K ⊗ S2).)

This suggests that we need some new postulates in order to address this situation. As already argued,2)) just because S1 ∪ S2 is inconsistent. The question is,it is too radical to give up all formulas of S1 (as imposed by (Cin revising by S1 and then S2 when S1 ∪ S2 is inconsistent, what formulas in S1 should be retained? Intuitively, a formulaα ∈ S1 should be kept if there is no evidence (in S1 and S2) against α after learning S2. To formalise this idea, we need thefollowing definition:⊗⊗Definition 2. Let S1, S2 be two sets of sentences. We denote by S1||S2 the set of all subsets of S1 that are consistentwith S2. That is Sc ∈ S1||S2 iff:1. Sc ⊆ S1.2. Sc ∪ S2 is consistent.Formally, the fact that there exists evidence in S1 against α after learning S2 (given the original belief state K) can beexpressed as: ∃Sc ∈ S1||S2 such that ¬α ∈ Bel(K ⊗ (Sc ∪ S2)).Based on these considerations, we obtain the so-called postulate of evidence retainment:(cid:2)If α ∈ S1 and α /∈ Bel(K ⊗ S1) ⊗ S2(cid:3),then ∃Sc ∈ S1||S2such that ¬α ∈ Bel(cid:2)(cid:3)K ⊗ (Sc ∪ S2).This postulate is inspired by the postulate of core retainment [20], which says a formula α is removed from a belief set Kby a contraction with β only if there is some evidence in K that shows that α contributes to the implication of β. Formally,core retainment is expressed as follows:If α ∈ K and α /∈ K − β,then ∃ A ⊆ K such that A (cid:2) β but A ∪ α (cid:5) β.The postulate of evidence retainment can be equivalently rephrased as follows:⊗(Ret) If α ∈ S1, and for every Sc ∈ S1||S2 where S2 (cid:14)= ∅ we have ¬α /∈ Bel(K ⊗ (Sc ∪ S2)), then(cid:2)α ∈ Bel(K ⊗ S1) ⊗ S2(cid:3).⊗Recall Example 1 with S1 = {a, m} and S2 = {¬a}. Since S1||S2 = {{m}}, Postulate (Ret) implies that (K ⊗ S1) ⊗ S2 (cid:5) m,which gives us the desired result. Note that, in case a and m make up a single piece of information (i.e. S 1 = {a ∧ m}),Postulate (Ret) does not apply.⊗To give a formal justification for (Ret), we will show a representation theorem.⊗Definition 3.

OCF-based parallel revisionUp to this point, we have considered those properties that parallel revision, regarded a mathematical function, shouldsatisfy. We now present a concrete parallel revision operator which satisfies all the proposed postulates. The operator isbased on Spohn’s proposal of ordinal conditional functions [37].Originally, an ordinal conditional function (OCF) was defined as a mapping κ from the set of possible worlds ΘP tothe class of ordinals such that some world was assigned the value 0. An OCF provides one concrete form of a belief state.As in [38], for the sake of simplicity, we take the signature of an OCF κ as ΘP → N, where κ(w) is called the rank ofw. Intuitively, the rank of a world represents its degree of plausibility. The lower a world’s rank, the more plausible thatworld is. A formula α is in the belief set Bel(κ) just if every world of rank 0 is a model of α; that is:(cid:2)Mod(cid:3)Bel(κ)=(cid:5)w(cid:6)(cid:6) κ(w) = 0(cid:7).The corresponding faithful ranking can be defined as follows:w 1 (cid:2)κ w 2iff κ(w 1) (cid:3) κ(w 2).(3)Given an OCF κ , we extend this function to a ranking on sentences (or sets of sentences) as follows:(cid:4)κ(μ) =∞min{κ(w) | w |(cid:11) μ} otherwise .if (cid:5) ¬μ,Put in words, the rank of a sentence is the lowest rank of a world in which the sentence holds.In what follows we give a concrete parallel revision function in terms of an OCF. That is, for a given OCF κ and finite setof formulas S, we define a revised OCF κ ⊗ S; the corresponding faithful ranking can then be obtained via (3).Consider for reference the semantic conditions for parallel revision:⊗⊗⊗⊗(P(Ret(PC3(PC4R) Let S1 ⊂ S where S1 ∪ (S \ S1) (cid:2) ⊥. Then min(Mod(S \ S1), (cid:2)K⊗S ) ⊆ Mod(S1).R) If S|w 2 ⊂ S|w 1, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 implies that w 1 ≺K⊗S w 2.R) If S|w 2 ⊆ S|w 1, then w 1 ≺K w 2 implies w 1 ≺K⊗S w 2.R) If S|w 2 ⊆ S|w 1, then w 1 (cid:2)K w 2 implies w 1 (cid:2)K⊗S w 2.We will use the following notation: Let S be a finite set of formulas, and let S 1 ⊆ S.C s(S1) = S1 ∪ (S \ S1),min(μ, κ) =(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6) w |(cid:11) μ, and for every w(cid:15)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:15)(cid:7)(cid:15) (cid:14)|(cid:11) μ.where κ< κ(w), wwwMnemonically, C s(S1) is the “completion” of S1 with respect to S: If α ∈ S \ S1 then ¬α ∈ C s(S1). min(μ, κ) is the set ofleast μ worlds with respect to κ . We also use min(S, κ) for a set of formulas S to denote the κ -least set of S-worlds.The construction of κ ⊗ S is given in terms of a recurrence relation. The definition is admittedly somewhat complicated,although each part of the definition reflects a basic intuition concerning postulates of parallel OCF revision. Consequently,after presenting the definition, we discuss intuitions underlying the parts of the definition, and then provide a formalstatement that shows that the definition indeed specifies a general parallel revision operator.2238J.

Assume that (κ ⊗ S)(w 1) has been assigned for every w 1 ∈ ΘP where w 1 ∈ min(C s(S1), κ), and where S1 ⊆ S and|S| − |S1| < i for i > 0.Let w 2 ∈ min(C s(S2), κ) where S2 ⊂ S and |S| − |S2| = i. Then(κ ⊗ S)(w2) = max(cid:3)(cid:3),(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:2)(κ ⊗ S)(cid:2)(cid:2)(κ ⊗ S)(cid:6)(cid:6) S2 ⊂ SC s(cid:15)1(cid:15)1⊆ S and(cid:15)S1+ κ(cid:6)(cid:6)SC s(cid:3)(cid:3)S(cid:15)1(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)− κC s(S2)(cid:6)(cid:6) + 1 = |S2|(cid:15)C sS1(cid:7)+ 1.(cid:3)(cid:3)(4)(5)3.

The first condition in the definitionapplies to minimum S worlds in κ , and ensures that these worlds are given rank 0 in κ ⊗ S; the remaining conditionsimplicitly assign a rank greater than 0 to all other worlds. The second part of the definition assigns ranks in κ ⊗ S tominimum (in κ ) C s(S1) worlds for every S1 ⊂ S. This part is phrased iteratively, working from larger subsets of S tosmaller. The third part of the definition assigns ranks in κ ⊗ S to all remaining worlds.Intuitively the various postulates are obtained as follows. Since the set of 0-ranked worlds in κ ⊗ S is the same as theminimum S worlds in κ , and since every world is assigned a rank in κ ⊗ S, it follows that κ ⊗ S defines a faithful ranking.R) is obtained by requiring, for S2 ⊂ S1 ⊆ S where |S2| + 1 = |S1|, thatThus, via [22] we have an AGM revision operator.

This is taken care ofby (4) in the definition. The general case, where |S2| + i = |S1| for i > 0 follows trivially by transitivity of (cid:4). (PC3R) and(PC4R) are obtained by a condition similar to that in [9], adjusted for subsets of a set of formulas for revision: For worldsw 1 and w 2 where we have S1|w 1 = S1|w 2 for S1 ⊆ S, we require that the difference in rankings between w 1 and w 2 will⊗be the same in κ ⊗ S as in κ . Condition 3 of the definition ensures that this is the case. (RetR) is trickier; refer to Fig. 1,where we have that κ(w 1) = κ(w 2), and assume that w 1 ∈ Mod(C s(S1)) and w 2 ∈ Mod(C s(S2)). The minimum C s(S1) andC s(S2) worlds are indicated by arrows on the κ ranking. A potential problem arises, in that to this point there is nothing toprevent⊗(cid:2)(κ ⊗ S)(cid:3)C s(S2)(cid:2)− (κ ⊗ S)⊗(cid:3)C s(S1)⊗R) and (PC4Our constraints for (PC3this would yield that(cid:2)(cid:3)C s(S2)(cid:2)(cid:3)C s(S1).− κ< κR) require that the respective distances d1 and d2 be the same in κ and κ ⊗ S, and(κ ⊗ S)(w2) − (κ ⊗ S)(w1) < 0.⊗This in turn violates (RetR) is satisfied.To establish formally that the definition indeed stipulates a parallel OCF revision function, we first state several smallR). Condition (5) in the definition ensures that this doesn’t occur, and so that (Ret⊗results that identify pertinent facts concerning the definition.First, the definition yields an AGM revision function.Lemma 1. Let κ be an OCF and let κ ⊗ S be given by Definition 4. Then κ ⊗ S defines a faithful ranking.The next lemma shows that the definition satisfies the basic parallel revision postulate.J. Delgrande, Y. Jin / Artificial Intelligence 176 (2012) 2223–22452239Lemma 2. Let κ be an OCF, let κ ⊗ S be given by Definition 4, and let S2 ⊂ S1 ⊆ S. Then (κ ⊗ S)(C s(S1)) < (κ ⊗ S)(C s(S2)).As well, worlds that satisfy exactly the same elements of a set S retain their relative ranking before and after revision.Lemma 3. Let κ be an OCF, let κ ⊗ S be given by Definition 4, and let S|w 1 = S|w 2. Then (κ ⊗ S)(w 1) − (κ ⊗ S)(w 2) = κ(w 1) −κ(w 2).We obtain the following result.Theorem 5. Parallel OCF revision satisfies the extended AGM postulates, (P6. Conclusion⊗), (Ret⊗), (PC3⊗), and (PC4⊗).In this paper, we have developed an account of parallel belief revision, in which the second argument to a revision functionis a finite set of formulas. Each formula of the set represents an individual item of information. Thus K ∗ {α, β} specifies arevision of K by two formulas, while K ∗ {α ∧ β} specifies a revision of K by a single formula that happens to be expressedas a conjunction. The intention is that, following revision by a set of formulas, if a subsequent revision is in conflict withsome members of the original set, then belief in the other elements of that set is retained. Thus, in revising by {α, β}and then by {¬β}, then, if α and β are independent, α continues to be believed in the resulting belief state. This is notnecessarily the case in revising by {α ∧ β} and then by {¬β}. Informally, a revision K ∗ {α, β} can be seen as yielding notjust the (contingent) incorporation of α and β among the beliefs of K, but also incorporating a counterfactual assumptionthat if one of α or β was subsequently believed to be false, then the agent would still believe the other formula to be true(provided there is no positive logical dependence between α and β).We presented two accounts of parallel belief revision. First, we consider a basic approach, in which minimal conditionsfor revising by a set of formulas are developed. Two postulates are proposed, along with corresponding semantic conditions,and a representation result is given. Semantically we require that in a revision by a set of formulas S, in the associatedfaithful ordering on worlds, for S1 ⊂ S, at the least S \ S1 worlds we also have that S1 is true. As a consequence, problemsassociated with the DP Postulate (C2) are sidestepped. Second, we develop a “preferred” account of iterated parallel revision,consisting of an additional three new postulates. This is carried out by extending the approach of Jin and Thielscher [21]for iterated revision to deal with sets of formulas. Again, corresponding semantic conditions are given and a representationresult derived. Last, Section 5 provides a concrete construction of a parallel revision operator.Our account of parallel revision is intended as an extension of the AGM approach. In particular, revising by an inconsis-tent set of formulas yields an inconsistent belief set. For future work, an obvious and interesting extension is to examinerevision in the case of an inconsistent set of formulas. As the examples at the end of Section 3 indicate, there is informationthat may be gleaned in revising by an inconsistent set of formulas, provided some of the elements of the set are consistent.Thus, given some “reasonable” means of extracting consistent information from a set S, say (cid:8)(S), one could express revisionas follows:Bel(K ⊗ S) = Bel(cid:2)(cid:3)K ⊗ ((cid:8)S).Hence in this case, if β were consistent, one would expect that Bel(K ⊗ {α, ¬α, β}) would also be consistent and entail β,while Bel(K ⊗ {α ∧ ¬α ∧ β}) would of course be inconsistent. In this way, one might obtain consistent revisions in somecases where the input is inconsistent.Last, as indicated in the examples in the basic approach, parallel revision may be used to encode preferences overformulas with respect to revision. A second, intriguing direction for future research is to further explore this phenomenon,to determine to what extent the present approach may be used to express a general notion of preference over formulas inrevision.Appendix A. Proofs of TheoremsNotation. For W ⊆ ΘP , form(W) is a formula such that W = Mod(form(W)). Since we assume a finite underlying language,such a formula is guaranteed to exist. Most often we will have |W| = 2, and to avoid an overabundance of brackets we willabuse notation and write e.g. K ⊗ {form({w 1, w 2})} as K ⊗ form(w 1, w 2).In analogy to Bel(K) standing for the set of sentences comprising the belief set of K (and to simplify notation), Mod(K)will be the set of models of the belief set of K. I.e. Mod(K) is defined as Mod(Bel(K)).Proof of Proposition 1. Assume that S1 ⊂ S and that S1 ∪ (S \ S1) is consistent.1.
