Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134Statics and dynamics of induced systemsMichael Freund 1Department of Mathematics, University of Orléans, F-45067 Orléans, La Source Cedex, FranceReceived 3 July 1998AbstractA collection of formulae, regarded as a set of prerequisite-free normal defaults, generates anonmonotonic inference relation through its Reiter skeptical extension. The structure of the initialset totally determines the behavior of the associated inference relation, and the aim of this paper isto investigate in two directions the link that exists between a set of defaults and its induced inferencerelation. First, we determine the structural conditions corresponding to the important property ofrationality. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of stratification for a set of defaults, and provethat stratified sets are exactly those that induce a rational inference relation. This result is shownto have interesting consequences in belief revision theory, as it can be used to define a nontrivialfull meet revision operator for belief bases. Then, we adopt a dynamic point of view and study theeffects, on the induced inference relation, of a change in the set of defaults. In this perspective, theset of defaults, considered as a knowledge base, together with its induced inference relation is treatedas an expert system. We show how to modify the original set of defaults in order to obtain as outputa rational relation. We propose a revision procedure that enables the user to incorporate a new datain the knowledge base, and we finally show what changes can be performed on the original set ofdefaults in order to take into account a particular conditional that has to retracted from or added tothe primitive induced inference relation.

Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134It was noticed in [13,15] that this induced inference relation is a preferential inferencerelation, in the sense of [11], and that it can be represented by a special kind of preferentialmodel, where the set of states coincides with the set of all worlds attached to the language.Conversely, we proved in [4] that any consistency-preserving preferential inference relationdefined on a finite language by an injective model is always induced by a set of defaults.Thus, preferential reasoning, when determined by a preferential injective model, is, in thefinite case, essentially the same as default reasoning: the logic of any agent using injectivepreferential reasoning is fully determined by a set of normal prerequisite-free defaults. Thisapplies in particular to rational reasoning, as it is known that rational inference relationsmay always be defined by means of a ranked injective model [3,11].In this paper, we investigate the link that exists between a set of defaults D and itsinduced inference relation j(cid:24)D. First, on a statics point of view, we characterize the setsof defaults for which the induced inference relation satisfies the property of rationality(postulate K (cid:3) 8 in belief revision theory). We show that a set satisfies this condition if andonly if it has a stratified structure, analogous to a logical chain of sets. This study turnsout to have interesting applications in the framework of belief revision: as an example,we show that our results may be used to construct a nontrivial base revision operator thatsatisfies the extended set of AGM postulates as well as the categorial matching principle.This solves a problem posed in [9]. After this statics study, we evoke in the second part ofthe paper the dynamics of induced systems, and examine some problems connected withchanges occurring in a given set of defaults: in this perspective, the set D is understood asrepresenting all the information available to an agent, and the inference relation j(cid:24)D thatit induces corresponds to the inferences drawn by the agent. Thus the couple .D; j(cid:24)D/ isconsidered as an expert system. In this perspective, it might be necessary to operate changesin the knowledge base D for different reasons: first, in order to improve the system, onemay require that the resulting inference process is of a rational type, so that one has toreplace D by a stratified set. Then, it might appear necessary to incorporate in D somenew information. The problem is then to revise D by this information without alteringtoo much the resulting inference process. A last problem finally is the one that occurswhen one wants to modify the set of defaults D because either it appears necessary toobtain a particular conditional that was not originally entailed by D, or, on the contrary,one wishes to remove a conditional that was part of the primitive induced relation. Forall these problems, we shall see that several solutions exist, and we shall compare theirmerits.In order to make the paper self-contained, we have recalled in Section 1 the basicdefinitions and properties of preferential inference relations. The notion of inducedinference relation is introduced in Section 2, where we give a simple proof of therepresentation theorem of faithfully representable inference relations via their associatedbasic set of defaults. In Section 3, we present a characterization of the default sets thatinduce rational inference relations and propose an application in the framework of baserevision theory. Section 4 is an introduction to the general study of the dynamics of inducedsystems. In Section 5, we discuss the problem of rationalizing an inference relation by asuitable modification of its set of defaults. In Section 6, we treat the problem of revising aset of defaults by a new information and the effect of this revision on the induced inference.Section 7 is concerned with the problem of conditional revision, which occurs when a givenM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134105conditional has to be forced in the agent’s beliefs. We conclude in Section 8. Proofs of themain results are given in Appendix A.1. BackgroundWe denote by L set of well-formed formulae over a set of atomic propositions, closedunder the classical propositional connectives :, _, ^, ! and $. When there are onlyfinitely many atomic propositions, the language is said to be logically finite. Semanticsis provided by the set W of all assignments of truth values to the propositional variables.Elements of W will be referred to as worlds, and the satisfaction relation between a worldm and a formula (cid:11) is defined as usual and written m jD (cid:11). Thus m jD (cid:11) _ (cid:12) iff m jD (cid:11) orm jD (cid:12), and m jD :(cid:11) iff it is not the case that m jD (cid:11).For any world m and any subset A of L, we denote by formA.m/ the set of formulae ofA satisfied by m. The set of worlds that satisfy A will be denoted by Mod.A/. We writem jD A iff m satisfies all the elements of A, that is iff A D formA.m/.The classical consequence operation attached to L and W will be denoted by Cn: forany subset A of L; Cn.A/ is the set of all formulae (cid:11) of L such that m jD (cid:11) for all worldsm that satisfy A. Given a subset A of L, we say that A is consistent iff Cn.A/ 6D L or,equivalently, iff there exists a world m satisfying A. The set A is said to be consistent withthe set B iff A [ B is a consistent set. We write Cn.A; B/ for Cn.A [ B/, and Cn.(cid:11)/ forCn.f(cid:11)g/. We use the notation (cid:11) ‘ (cid:12) as an abbreviation for (cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11)/.1.1. Preferential inference relationsFollowing Kraus et al. [11], we call preferential inference relation on L a relation j(cid:24) thatsatisfies the following rules:Reflexivity. (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:11).Left Logical Equivalence. If Cn.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:12)/ and (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:13) , then (cid:12) j(cid:24) (cid:13) .Right Weakening. If (cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11)/ and (cid:13) j(cid:24) (cid:11), then (cid:13) j(cid:24) (cid:12).Cut. If (cid:11) ^ (cid:12) j(cid:24) (cid:13) and (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12), then (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:13) .Or. If (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:13) and (cid:12) j(cid:24) (cid:13) , then (cid:11) _ (cid:12) j(cid:24) (cid:13) .Cautious Monotonicity. If (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) and (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:13) , then (cid:11) ^ (cid:12) j(cid:24) (cid:13) .Given such a relation, we shall denote by Cj(cid:24).(cid:11)/—or C.(cid:11)/ when there is noambiguity—the set of all consequences of a formula (cid:11), that is the set of all (cid:12)’s such that(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12). We will indifferently refer to “the inference relation j(cid:24)” or to “the inference relationC”. The above rules imply that, for any preferential inference relation C, the sets C.(cid:11)/ areclosed with respect to Cn, that is CnTC.(cid:11)/U D C.(cid:11)/ for all formulae (cid:11). A formula (cid:11) isj(cid:24)-consistent, or C-consistent, iff C.(cid:11)/ 6D L. An inference relation C is said to beconsistency-preserving iff C.(cid:11)/ is a consistent set for any consistent formula (cid:11). Thusa preferential inference relation C is consistency-preserving iff C.(cid:11)/ 6D L wheneverCn.(cid:11)/ 6D L.106M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–1341.2. Preferential modelsA preferential structure is a triple M D .S; <; l/ where < is an irreflexive and transitiverelation defined on a set S (the set of “states”), and l (the “label function”) is a mappingfrom S in the set of worlds W . For any state s, we say that s satisfies the formula (cid:11) (writtens jD (cid:11)) iff l.s/ does, and we denote by ModS.(cid:11)/ the set of all such states s.A preferential model, as defined in [11], is a preferential structure .S; <; l/ that satisfiesthe following condition of smoothness: given any formula (cid:11) and any state s in ModS.(cid:11)/that is not minimal in ModS.(cid:11)/, there exists a state t minimal in ModS.(cid:11)/ such that t < s.This condition is always satisfied when the preferential structure is finite (i.e., when its setof states is finite).A preferential model M determines a preferential inference relation j(cid:24)(cid:11) j(cid:24)M (cid:12) iff all minimal elements of ModS.(cid:11)/ satisfy (cid:12).M by(def)The interest of preferential models is that they represent all preferential relations. It wasshown indeed in [11] that, for any preferential inference relation j(cid:24) defined on a language L(respectively, a logically finite language L), there exists a preferential model (respectively,a finite preferential model) M such that j(cid:24) D j(cid:24)M .1.3. Injective models and faithfully representable inference relationsWe shall call injective a preferential model in which the label function l is injective.We will be particularly interested in the case where the map l is a bijection. Then, the setof states can be identified with the set W of all worlds, and the model M is of the form.W; </, where < is a strict smooth partial order on W . A preferential inference relation thatcan be represented by a model of the form .W; </ will be called a faithfully representableinference relation. Such an inference relation is clearly consistency-preserving. If C is afaithfully representable inference relation defined on a logically finite language, the modelthat represents C is unique, and we will refer to it as the standard model of C (cf. [3]), oras its Shoham model (cf. [17]).When the language is logically finite, for any subset T of W we shall denote by (cid:31)T theformula equal to the disjunction of all the complete formulae associated with the elementsof T , that is the unique (up to classical equivalence) formula (cid:11) such that m jD (cid:11) iff m 2 T .We have thus Mod.(cid:31)T / D T .In the case of a logically finite language, it will be convenient to identify a world withthe sequence of positive literals that this world satisfies. Thus, in the language built on thepropositional variables p; q; r; s; t, the world prs denotes the world that takes value 1 atp; r and s, and takes value 0 at q and t. We will denote by (cid:3) the world that satisfies nopositive literal.1.4. The basic set of defaults associated with the preferential model .W; </Given any strict smooth partial order < on the set W , there exists a set of formulae (cid:1)<that plays a prominent role in the study of faithfully representable inference relations. Thisset will be referred to as the basic set of defaults associated with the model .W; </; itconsists of all the formulae (cid:11) that satisfy the following condition:M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134If (cid:11) is satisfied by a world n,then (cid:11) is satisfied by all worlds m such that m < n.107((cid:3))Note that the basic set of defaults associated with a preferential model .W; </ isclosed under conjunction and disjunction, and contains the tautologies as well as thecontradictions of the language L. When L is logically finite, we can define the basic setof defaults associated with a faithfully representable inference relation j(cid:24) as the set (cid:1)<associated with the unique model .W; </ that represents j(cid:24). In this particular case of alogically finite language, we will always suppose fixed a representative of each class underclassical equivalence, and choose the elements (cid:11) of the basic set of defaults among therepresentatives of these equivalence classes. Thus in this case, we will view the basic setof defaults as a finite set consisting of the chosen representatives of the formulae (cid:11) thatsatisfy .(cid:3)/.2. Poole systemsThe definition and the principal properties of the inference relation associated with aPoole system can be found in [7,8,13]. We briefly recall some basic facts.2.1. Definition and main properties of Poole systemsLet D be any subset of L. We may identify this set with a Poole system withoutconstraints .D; ;/ and use this system to determine the conditions that would enable usto infer a formula (cid:12) from a premiss (cid:11), holding true as much as possible from D. Clearly,such a formula (cid:12) should be accepted in the simplest case where it is classically entailedby the conjunction of (cid:11) and D, provided that the new information represented by (cid:11) isconsistent with the basic knowledge base D. In other words, if (cid:11) is consistent with D,we consider that (cid:12) follows from (cid:11) modulo D if and only if (cid:11) ! (cid:12) 2 Cn.D/. This idealeads to the following definition of the inference relation j(cid:24)D induced by the set of defaultsD: (cid:12) follows nonmonotonically from (cid:11) modulo D iff (cid:11) ! (cid:12) is a classical consequence ofevery subset of D that is consistent with (cid:11) and is maximal for that property. This definitionamounts to identifying the Poole system .D; ;/ with its set of defaults, and to identify adefault formula (cid:14) with the prerequisite-free normal Reiter style default: (cid:14)=(cid:14). The set of allformulae (cid:12) such that (cid:11) j(cid:24)D (cid:12) is then equal to the intersection of all the Reiter extensionsof .(cid:11); D/ as defined in [16]. Thus one has(cid:11) j(cid:24)D (cid:12) iff (cid:12) 2Cn.(cid:11); D(cid:11)/;\where the intersection is taken over all the subsets D(cid:11) of D that are maximally consistentwith (cid:11). Clearly, if the language is logically finite, D may be assumed to be a finite set.It is known that the inference relation CD D j(cid:24)D associated with a Poole system withoutconstraints .D; ;/ is a preferential inference relation (see, for instance, [7]), and it isimmediate from its definition that this inference relation preserves consistency. We willrefer to it as the inference relation induced by the set of defaults D. As noticed by108M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134Alchourron and Makinson [2], the “limiting case” where D is a closed theory, that is whereD D Cn.D/, gives a trivial output: in this case, one has CD.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:11); D/ for all formulae(cid:11) consistent with D, and CD.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:11)/ for all other formulae [13, Observation 3.3.6].Example 1 (Defaults and axioms). Suppose that D consists of the single default (cid:14). Oneeasily sees that the induced inference relation j(cid:24)(cid:14) is defined by(cid:11) j(cid:24)(cid:11) j(cid:24)(cid:14) (cid:12) iff (cid:11) ^ (cid:14) ‘ (cid:12) when (cid:11) is consistent with (cid:14), and(cid:14) (cid:12) iff (cid:11) ‘ (cid:14) when (cid:11) is inconsistent with (cid:14).Thus in the principal case where (cid:11) is consistent with (cid:14), the set of formulae that canbe inferred from (cid:11) modulo (cid:14) coincides with the set of classical consequences of (cid:11) in theaxiomatic theory obtained by adding the axiom (cid:14) to the axioms of propositional calculus.A set of defaults D (cid:18) L induces a strict partial order <D on the set of worlds W , which isdefined by m <D n iff formD.n/ is a strict subset of formD.m/. As observed independentlyby Makinson [13] and Poole [15], this order provides a semantic representation of thepreferential relation j(cid:24)D induced by D: one shows indeed that the structure .W; <D/ isa preferential model that represents j(cid:24)D (see [4] for an alternative proof), so that thisinference relation is faithfully representable. It is worth pointing out that this model isparticularly interesting because it is simple to build and corresponds to the intuitive ideathat a world m is less exceptional, or more normal, than a world n iff it satisfies a largersubset of formulae in D than n does.Example 2 (Logical chains). Let D D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)hg be a set of nonequivalent formulaesuch that (cid:14)h D True and, for all indices i; 0 6 i 6 h (cid:0) 1; (cid:14)i ‘ (cid:14)iC1. Such a set D—orthe corresponding .h C 1/-tuple .(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)h/—will be called a logical chain. Let usdetermine the inference relation induced by D. By definition, for any consistent formula (cid:11)and any formula (cid:12), we have(cid:11) j(cid:24)D (cid:12) iff (cid:12) 2\Cn.(cid:11); D(cid:11)/:The only subset D(cid:11) of D that is maximally consistent with (cid:11) is the set f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)hg,where i is the first index such that (cid:11) is consistent with (cid:14)i . It follows that (cid:11) j(cid:24)D (cid:12) iff(cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11); (cid:14)i/ that is iff (cid:11) ^ (cid:14)i ‘ (cid:12).By the choice of D, the order of the associated preferential model .W; <D/ is given bym <D n iff there exists an index i such that (cid:14)i is satisfied by m and not by n. It is interestingto note that, when D is finite, this relation holds iff m satisfies a strictly greater number ofelements of D than n: in other words, given any finite logical chain D, the order inducedby D is the (ranked) order m <D n iff Card.formD.n// < Card.formD.m//.M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–1341092.2. Faithfully representable inference relations and induced relationsWe have seen that any induced inference relation is faithfully representable. A partialconverse has been established in [4]; we present here a simple proof in the case of logicallyfinite languages.Theorem 3. For any strict partial order < defined on the set W of worlds of a logicallyfinite language, one has < D <(cid:1), where (cid:1) is the set of defaults associated with thepreferential model .W; </.Proof. (a) Suppose first that it is not the case that m < n. We have to prove that it is not thecase that m <(cid:1) n. Without loss of generality, one may suppose m 6D n. Let Inf.n/ be the setof all worlds p such that p D n or p < n, and (cid:14)n the formula equal to (cid:31)Inf.n/. We claim that(cid:14)n is classically to an element of form(cid:1).n/, but is equivalent to no element of form(cid:1).m/.Indeed, observe that, up to classical equivalence, one has (cid:14)n 2 (cid:1), since condition .(cid:3)/ isclearly satisfied. Moreover, n satisfies (cid:14)n, and this formula cannot be satisfied by m since,otherwise, one would have m < n or m D n, contradicting our assumption. This showsthat there exists an element of form(cid:1).n/ that is not in form(cid:1).m/, so that one cannot havem <(cid:1) n.(b) Suppose conversely that m < n, and let us show that m <(cid:1) n. It is clear that form(cid:1).n/is a subset of form(cid:1).m/, since for any formula (cid:11) 2 (cid:1) satisfied by n, one has m jD (cid:11) bycondition .(cid:3)/. It remains to prove that this inclusion is strict. But one does not have n < m,and a construction similar to the preceding one shows the existence of a formula (cid:14)m thatbelongs to form(cid:1).m/ and not to form(cid:1).n/, whence the result. 2Note that Theorem 3 establishes two important results in the case of logically finitelanguages: the first one states that any strict partial order < on W is of inclusion type:there exists a set D such that < D <D. The second one is that the basic set of defaults (cid:1)associated with .W; </ may be taken for such a set D, and therefore provides an explicitconstruction for D by means of the condition .(cid:3)/. Nevertheless, it should be emphasizedthat the set (cid:1) is usually not the simplest of the sets that induce a given order on W . Since(cid:1) is closed under conjunction and disjunction, it may be suspected that it is usually a “verylarge” set, a fact that is confirmed by the following observations:Observation 4. Any set D of formulae that satisfies < D <D is embedded in (cid:1).Proof. Let (cid:11) be an element of D and n a world that satisfies (cid:11). If m is a world such thatm < n, we have m <D n, that is formD.n/ (cid:26) formD.m/. We have therefore (cid:11) 2 formD.m/,so m jD (cid:11). This shows that (cid:11) satisfies condition .(cid:3)/ and is therefore an element of (cid:1). 2The set (cid:1) is therefore the largest subset D of L such that < D <D. As we will shownow, it is in fact large enough to “separate the worlds”.Observation 5. Let < be a strict partial order on the set W of worlds of a logically finitelanguage, and (cid:1) its associated basic set of defaults. Then two worlds agree on (cid:1) iff theyare equal.110M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134Proof. Suppose that there exists two worlds m 6D n such that form(cid:1).m/ D form(cid:1).n/. Thisequality shows that we do not have m <(cid:1) n. By Theorem 3, this implies that m 6< n. Aswe saw in the proof of Theorem 3, there exists then a formula (cid:14)n 2 form(cid:1).n/ that is not anelement of form(cid:1).m/, contradicting our assumption. 2The property described in the observation above holds for some choices of injectivemodels of the type .W; </ even in the case of infinite languages, as can be seen in thefollowing example:Example 6. Let L be an arbitrary propositional language, (cid:14) a consistent formula of L, andD the set Cn.(cid:14)/. Let us determine the basic set of defaults (cid:1) associated with the model.W; <D/. We first note that m <D n iff (cid:14) is satisfied by m and not by n: indeed, if m <D n,one has m 6D n and there exists a formula (cid:11) 2 D satisfied by n and not by m. The formula(cid:11) _ (cid:14) is an element of D and is satisfied by n, hence by m since we have m <D n. It followsthat m jD (cid:14). Conversely, if m jD (cid:14) and m jD :(cid:14), one has formD.n/ (cid:26) formD.m/ D D,whence m <D n as desired.Let (cid:1) be the basic set of defaults associated with .W; <D/. We claim that (cid:1) is the set ofall formulae that either imply (cid:14), or are implied by (cid:14). Indeed, if (cid:11) is an element of (cid:1) suchthat (cid:14) =2 Cn.(cid:11)/, there exists a world n such that n jD (cid:11) ^ :(cid:14). Let m be an arbitrary worldthat satisfies (cid:14). Since (cid:14) is satisfied by m and not by n, we have m <D n, and therefore msatisfies (cid:11). This shows that (cid:14) ‘ (cid:11), so that the elements of (cid:1) either imply (cid:14) or are impliedby (cid:14). Conversely, any formula (cid:13) that implies (cid:14) is satisfied only by minimal worlds, andtherefore satisfies condition .(cid:3)/. Since, by Observation 4, we have D (cid:18) (cid:1), this shows that(cid:1) is of the desired form.Let us show now that (cid:1) separates the worlds: suppose that there exists two world m 6D nthat agree on (cid:1), and let (cid:12) be a formula satisfied by m and not by n. The formula (cid:12) ^ (cid:14)of (cid:1) is not satisfied by n, and is therefore not satisfied by m. The formula :(cid:12) _ (cid:14) of (cid:1) issatisfied by n, hence by m. We have therefore m jD :(cid:12), contradicting our assumption.As a direct consequence of Theorem 3, we have the followingCorollary 7. Any faithfully representable inference relation j(cid:24) defined on a logically finitelanguage is induced by its associated basic set of defaults.Proof. Denote by .W; </ the standard model of j(cid:24) and by (cid:1) its associated basic set ofdefaults. It follows from Theorem 3 that we have .W; </ D .W; <(cid:1)/, and the preferentialrelations represented by these models are therefore identical. 2The meaning of Corollary 7 is that, under some mild conditions, preferential reasoningà la Shoham is the same as reasoning à la Poole. But its interest is also to point out theexistence of a basic set of defaults that comes to conditionalize, implicitly or explicitly,the inference process of any agent that uses faithfully representable preferential logic ona finite language, and in particular of any agent that uses consistency-preserving rationallogic, as will be shown in the next section. This result is reminiscent of some well knowntheories on human behavior, is as much as they claim that human beings are determined intheir judgments and actions by a set of primary affects.M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134111The question naturally arises whether Theorem 3 and its corollary have an analoguein the case of infinite propositional languages. The answer is in general negative (see [4,Example 8]), and we do not know of any property that would characterize in this case theinference relations that can be induced by a set of defaults.We have seen that it is possible to associate with any set of defaults a faithfullyrepresentable preferential inference relation; conversely, by Corollary 7, any such relationdefined on a logically finite language is induced by a set of defaults. In this duality betweendefault sets and faithfully representable inference relations, it is interesting to determine thedefault sets that correspond to the important sub-family of rational inference relations. Thiswill be done in the next section, where we shall provide a characterization of all defaultsets whose induced relation is rational.3. The analogue of rationality in the Poole–Shoham duality3.1. The characteristic set of a rational inference relationWe shall turn our attention to a specific family of preferential inference relations thatplay a prominent role in the area of nonmonotonic reasoning, namely the preferentialinference relations that satisfy the property of rationality. The aim of this property is tocapture inference process that, whilst defeasible, stand as close as possible to monotonicconsequence relations. Rational inference relations are characterized by the property ofRational Monotony, that reads, for all formulae (cid:11), (cid:12) and (cid:13) :RM. If (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) and not .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:13) /, then (cid:11) ^ (cid:13) j(cid:24) (cid:12).An inference relation is said to be rational iff it is preferential and satisfies RM. It is wellknown that a preferential relation is rational iff it may be defined by an injective preferentialmodel .S; </, where S is a subset of W and < is a smooth modular order on S, that is anorder in which the inequality m < n implies for any world p either m < p, or p < n. Anorder is modular iff there exists a totally ordered set .T ; <0/ and a “ranking” function (cid:20)from .S; </ into .T ; <0/ such that m < n iff (cid:20).m/ <0 (cid:20).n/ (see, for example, [3] or [12]).A preferential model .S; </ with modular order < is called a ranked model.When the underlying language is supposed to be finite and the rational relationconsistency-preserving, one may assume that the ranking function, defined on the wholeset W , takes its value in a finite set of integers. The height h of such a rational relation (orof its standard model) is the number of elements of (cid:20).W /. We will always suppose that theranking function is normalized, i.e., that (cid:20).W / is the set T0; h (cid:0) 1U D f0; 1; : : : ; h (cid:0) 1g.Since rational consistency-preserving inference relations are known to be faithfullyrepresentable, they are induced, in the finite case, by their associated basic set of defaults.In fact, the additional hypothesis of rationality yields a more accurate result: let h be theheight of such a relation j(cid:24), and, for any index i; 1 6 i 6 h, denote by i the (uniqueup to classical equivalence) formula such that Mod. i / D (cid:20) (cid:0)1T0; i (cid:0) 1U. Clearly, one has 1 ‘ 2 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ h(cid:0)1 ‘ True. Let (cid:9) be the set f i j 1 6 i 6 hg. This set, called thecharacteristic set of the rational relation, therefore has the structure of a logical chain,and it turns out that one has j(cid:24) D j(cid:24)(cid:9) . Thus any consistency-preserving rational inference112M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134relation defined on a logically finite language is induced by its characteristic set (see [4]for details). As we saw in Example 2, relations C induced by such logical chains are easyto compute: they satisfy C.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:11); i /, where i is the first (cid:11)-consistent elementof the chain, and the order < of their associated ranked model is given by m < n iffcard.form(cid:9) .n/ < card.form(cid:9) .m//.3.2. Stratified setsIt should not be inferred from the above considerations that, when a set of defaults Dinduces a rational inference relation, one has necessarily m <D n iff card.formD.n/ <card.formD.m//: For instance, taking for L the language built on the two propositions pand q, and, for D, the set fp ^ q; :q; :p ^ q; qg, one easily checks that <D is the emptyrelation and is therefore modular. Note that although the world q satisfies two elements ofD while p satisfies only one element, we do not have q <D p.From now on, we shall assume that the language is logically finite. By what pre-cedes, any logical chain induces a rational consistency-preserving inference relation,and any consistency-preserving rational inference relation is induced by a logical chain.Nevertheless, there exist sets as in the above example that induce a rational inferencerelation without having the structure of logical chain. Our purpose is now to characterizethese sets. To do so, we shall have first to look at the structure of the basic set of defaultsassociated with a modular order.Lemma 8. Let j(cid:24) be a consistency-preserving rational inference relation defined on alogically finite language, (cid:9) D f i j 0 < i 6 hg its characteristic set and (cid:1) its basic setof defaults. Then a formula (cid:11) is an element of (cid:1) iff either (cid:11) ‘ 0 or there exists anindex i; 1 6 i < h, such that i ‘ (cid:11) ‘ iC1.Remark. For all indices i such that 1 6 i < h, let us denote by (cid:1)i the set of all formulae(cid:11) 6D iC1 such that i ‘ (cid:11) ‘ iC1. Set (cid:1)0 D f(cid:11) j (cid:11) ‘ 1; (cid:11) 6D 1g and (cid:1)h D fTrueg: Thenthe above lemma shows that the sets (cid:1)i form a partition of (cid:1). Note that one has (cid:11) ‘ (cid:12) forall formulae (cid:11) 2 (cid:1)i and (cid:12) 2 (cid:1)iC1.This remark will be used to characterize the sets D that induce a rational inferencerelation. We first need to introduce the notion of determinable subsets.Definition 9. A subset X of a set of formulae Y is said to be determinable in Y iff thereexists a world p such that formY .p/ D X:Equivalently, X is determinable in Y iff X is consistent with the set f:(cid:12) j (cid:12) 2 Y (cid:0)Xg. Aswe shall see, the notion of determinable subsets is fundamental to characterize the defaultssets that induce rational relations.Definition 10. A subset D of a logically finite language is said to be stratified iff it is adisjoint union of sets Di that satisfy the following conditions:(1) (cid:11) ‘ (cid:12) for all formulae (cid:11) 2 Di and (cid:12) 2 DiC1.(2) Any nonempty proper subset of Di that is determinable in Di is maximally so.M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134113Given a stratified set D, any sequence .Di / satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of thedefinition will be called a stratification of D. A stratified set therefore splits into gradedsheaves Di and the sequence .Di / is analogous to a “logical multichain”: by condition (1),any element of a sheaf dominates the elements that belong to a sheaf of higher rank. As forcondition (2), note that it is equivalent to the condition.20/ For all worlds m and n, if ; (cid:26) form.n/ \ Di (cid:26) form.m/ \ Di , then form.m/ \ Di DDi:Thus, the trace on Di of two worlds m and n are never comparable, except in the limitcases. If we denote by <i the order on W induced by Di , we have thus m <i n iff either Diis satisfied by m and not by n, or m satisfies at least an element of Di while n satisfies noelement of this set. Condition .20/ therefore shows that <i is a modular order of height 6 3.Example 11.(a) The simplest nontrivial example of a stratified set is given by a logical chainD D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)hg with (cid:14)i ‘ (cid:14)iC1 for all indices i < h. It is indeed immediatethat the subsets Di D f(cid:14)ig satisfy conditions (1) and (2) of the definition. Anotherstratification of D is given by the partition Di D f(cid:14)ig if i < n (cid:0) 1 and Dn(cid:0)1 Df(cid:14)n(cid:0)1; (cid:14)ng. Thus the stratification of a set, if it exists, is not necessarily unique.(b) Any set Di of cardinality 6 2 satisfies condition (2) of the definition. It follows thatthe set D D D0 [ D1 [ D2 is stratified, where D0 D fp ^ q; q ^ rg; D1 D fq; p _ rgand D2 D fp _ q _ rg.(c) Any closed subset D of L is stratified. Let us show indeed that such a set satisfiescondition (2) of the definition. Suppose that X and Y are two nonempty determinablesubsets of D such that X (cid:26) Y . There exists then worlds m and n such thatformD.n/ D X and formD.m/ D Y . Let (cid:12) be an element of Y that is not in X.We have n jD :(cid:12) and m jD (cid:12). We claim that Y D D: otherwise, there would exist aformula (cid:11) of D such that m jD :(cid:11). Since D is closed, D would contain the formula(cid:11) _ :(cid:12), satisfied by n, and this would imply (cid:11) _ :(cid:12) 2 X, hence (cid:11) _ :(cid:12) 2 Y , leadingto m jD (cid:11) _ :(cid:12), a contradiction.Since D satisfies condition (2) of the definition, the trivial sequence .D/ provides astratification of D, and this shows that any closed set is stratified.(cid:0) D0Remark. If D is an union of sets D0i that satisfy conditions (1) and (2) of Definition 10,then D is a stratified set: consider indeed the family .Di / defined by D0 D D00 and, for alli > 0; Di D D0iC1. The sets Di then form a partition of D for which condition (1) isiclearly satisfied. To check condition (2), suppose that X D form.n/ \ Di is a nonemptydeterminable subset of Di strictly embedded in a set Y D form.m/ \ Di . Note that itfollows from condition (1) that, up to classical equivalence, the set D0iC1 has atimost one element. Let (cid:11) be this element, if it exists. We have n jD (cid:11), for n satisfies atleast an element (cid:12) of D0i , and we know that (cid:12) ‘ (cid:11). Similarly, m satisfies (cid:11). It followsthat form.n/ \ D0(cid:26)iform.m/ \ D0i , showing that Y D Di .i . By condition (2), we have then form.m/ \ D0D Y [ f(cid:11)g, and thus that form.n/ \ D0iD X (cid:18) f(cid:11)g, form.m/ \ D0iD D0\ D0iWe are now ready to establish the main theorem of this section.114M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134Theorem 12. The inference relation induced by a set D is rational iff D is stratified.This theorem characterizes the sets D for which the induced inference relation isrational. As noticed before, such a relation is also induced by its characteristic set (cid:9) Df i; 1 6 i 6 hg, where i is the formula defined by m jD i iff (cid:20).m/ < i. The linkbetween the set D and the chain (cid:9) is now given by the following observation, that showshow directly determine (cid:9) without computing the induced ranking (cid:20):Observation 13. Let D be a stratified set and .D1; D2; : : : ; Dh/ be a stratification of D.For any index i; 1 6 i 6 h, denote by (cid:17)i the conjunction of all elements of Di , and by (cid:17)0ithe disjunction of all elements of Di . Set (cid:17)hC1 D (cid:17)0D True. Then the characteristic set(cid:9) of the rational inference relation induced by D is the set f(cid:17)i; (cid:17)0ij 1 6 i 6 h C 1g.hC1Example 14. Let us determine the characteristic chains associated with the stratified setsof Example 11:(a) If D is a logical chain .(cid:14)1; (cid:14)2; : : : ; (cid:14)h/, we have readily (cid:17)i D (cid:17)0i(b) If D is the stratified set D0 [ D1 [ D2, with D0 D fp ^ q; q ^ rg; D1 D fq; p _ rgD (cid:14)i .and D2 D fp _ q _ rg, we have(cid:17)0 D p ^ q ^ r D (cid:17)(cid:17)01D p _ q _ r D (cid:17)2 D (cid:17)02;00;0(cid:17)1 D q.p _ r/;and the characteristic chain associated with D is.p ^ q ^ r; q ^ .p _ r/; p _ q _ r; True/:(c) If D is a closed set, there exists a formula (cid:14) 2 D such that D D Cn.(cid:14)/ (recall weassumed the language to be finite). The associated characteristic set is then equal to.(cid:14); True/.Remark. If D is a union of not necessarily disjoint sets D0i that satisfy conditions (1) and(2) of Definition 10, the elements (cid:17)i of the characteristic set associated with D are equal tothe conjunction of the elements of D0i are equal to their disjunction,as follows easily from the preceding remark.i , and the elements (cid:17)0As a straightforward consequence of Observation 13, we can explicitly compute therational consequences of a formula (cid:11) that are induced by a stratified set D:Observation 15. Let C be the rational inference relation induced by a stratified set D. Let.Dj /16j <h be a stratification of D, and Dh D fTrueg. For any consistent formula (cid:11), let i.Cn.(cid:11); (cid:13) / j (cid:13) 2be the first index such that (cid:11) is consistent with Di . Then one has C.(cid:11)/ DDi(cid:0)1/ if there exists a formula of Di(cid:0)1 that is consistent with (cid:11), and C.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:11); Di /otherwise.TIn the perspective of belief revision theory, this result may be analyzed as a general-ization of Grove’s theory of spheres [10]: when K is a belief set, any revision (cid:3) of K isM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134115T.Cn.(cid:11); (cid:13) / j (cid:13) 2determined by a system of embedded spheres Ki that are closed subsets of K. For any con-sistent formula (cid:11), the revision K (cid:3) (cid:11) of K by (cid:11) is equal to the expansion Cn.(cid:11); Ki/ of Kiby (cid:11), where i is the first index such that :(cid:11) =2 Ki . The above observation shows that thissystem of embedded spheres may still be used in the general case where the set of beliefsis not closed under classical consequences: indeed, using the notations of Observation 13,we note that Cn.DiC1/ (cid:18) Cn.(cid:17)0i / (cid:18) Cn.Di /, so that, in the light of Observation 15, thesesets may be considered as the analogues of the spheres Ki ’s. The main difference is thatthese spheres are no longer subsets of the “set of beliefs” D.Note, as an interesting consequence of Observation 15, that the setsDi(cid:0)1/ and Cn.(cid:11); Di / do not depend on any particular stratification of D.The study made in this subsection provides a satisfactory answer concerning the statusof rationality in the Poole–Shoham duality between default sets and induced inferencerelations. It is possible and interesting to extend this study to some families of preferentialinference relations that satisfy properties weaker than rationality, like weak rationality ordisjunctive rationality. In this paper, our study of the statics aspects of induced inferenceswill be nevertheless restricted to the only case of plain rationality. Before turning to thedynamics study of induced inferences, we conclude this section with an application of ourmain results in the framework of belief revision theory.3.3. Full meet base revisionThis paragraph may be seen as an illustration of the results that we established in thestudy of rational induced relations. As we shall see, Theorem 12 and Observations 13 and15 have interesting consequences in belief revision theory, leading to the definition and thestudy of a full meet base revision operator. The results we obtain in this paragraph havereceived an independent treatment in [5], where they have been established by the classicalmethods of belief theory.TGiven an arbitrary set of formulae B, the full meet revision of B by a formula (cid:11) is the setB (cid:3)(cid:11) DCn.(cid:11); B(cid:11)/, where the intersection is taken over all maximal (cid:11)-consistent subsetsB(cid:11) of B. In the case of a logically finite language, the revised set B (cid:3) (cid:11) is thus equal tothe set of consequences CB .(cid:11)/ inferred from (cid:11) by the inference relation CB induced fromthe set of defaults B. When the set B is closed under classical consequences, the fullmeet revision operator (cid:3) yields a trivial output, as results from the Alchourron–Makinsontriviality theorem: in this case, CB .(cid:11)/ is indeed equal to Cn.B; (cid:11)/ if (cid:11) is consistent withB, and to Cn.(cid:11)/ otherwise. If now B is not a closed set, and is therefore a belief base, theresults established in the previous section may be applied to study the properties of this fullmeet revision operator. Applying Theorem 12 and the formal correspondence establishedin [7] between nonmonotonic logic and the logic of theory change, we immediately get thefollowingObservation 16. Let B be a belief base, K its closure and (cid:6) the revision on K defined byK(cid:6)(cid:11) D B (cid:3) (cid:11). Then (cid:6) satisfies the extended set of AGM postulates iff B is stratified.The result stated in Observation 16 is in fact of little use in belief revision theory:indeed, it can be applied only when the theory K to be revised is given together with a116M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134set of “justifications” B. In particular, its iteration is meaningless, since no justificationis provided for the revised theory K(cid:6)(cid:11). Note that the operator (cid:3) suffers from the sameshortcoming: the result B (cid:3) (cid:11) of the revision of the base B by (cid:11) is a closed theory, and theiteration of this revision provides a trivial output by the Alchourron–Makinson trivialitytheorem. Furthermore, the use of (cid:3) as a base revision operator violates the categorialmatching principle, according to which “the representation of a belief state after a beliefchange has taken place should be of the same format as the representation of the beliefstate before change” [9]. This principle is therefore violated when, starting with a beliefbase B, or a theory K with known justification B, one obtains the closed theory B (cid:3) (cid:11) inwhich the track of any such justification is lost.It is nevertheless possible to use Theorem 12 together with Observation 15 to define afull meet base revision operator (cid:6) that satisfies the principle of categorial matching, andthe closure of which satisfies the extended set of AGM postulates. This operator is definedas follows:Let B be a stratified set and .Bj /06j 6s a stratification of B. Without loss of generality,we can suppose that True 2 B and that Bs D fTrueg. Let (cid:11) be a consistent formula, i thefirst index such that (cid:11) is consistent with Bi , and (cid:12)1; (cid:12)2; : : : ; (cid:12)n .n > 0/ the elements ofBi(cid:0)1 that are consistent with (cid:11). The full meet base revision of B by (cid:11) is the setB(cid:6)(cid:11) D f(cid:11) ^ .(cid:12)1 _ (cid:12)2 _ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) _ (cid:12)n/g.(cid:11) ^ Bk/ [ fTrueg;[k>iwhere (cid:11) ^ Bk denotes the set f(cid:11) ^ (cid:13) j (cid:13) 2 Bkg.We showed in [5] that this set B(cid:6)(cid:11) does not depend on the choice of the stratification.Bi/; so that the operator (cid:6) is well-defined (the proof of this result is rather long andtedious, and we do not incorporate it here, as belief revision is not the subject of thispaper). It is now easy to prove that B(cid:6)(cid:11) is a stratified base, as the sequence B0D0f(cid:11) ^ .(cid:12)1 _ (cid:12)2 _ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) _ (cid:12)n/g; B0D f(cid:11)g satisfies1conditions (1) and (2) of Definition 10.D (cid:11) ^ BiC1; : : : ; B0D (cid:11) ^ Bi; B02s(cid:0)iC1For all consistent formulae (cid:11), the full meet base revision operator (cid:6) therefore associatesa stratified base B(cid:6)(cid:11) with any stratified base B. Using Observation 15, one readily checksthat the full meet revision operator (cid:3) and the full meet base revision operator (cid:6) areconnected by the equality Cn.B(cid:6)(cid:11)/ D B (cid:3) (cid:11), showing that the closure-extension of (cid:6)is an AGM revision.Example 17.(a) Let B be the logical chain (cid:14)0 ‘ (cid:14)1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ (cid:14)h(cid:0)1 ‘ True. For any consistent formula(cid:11), one has B(cid:6)(cid:11) D (cid:14)i ^ (cid:11) ‘ (cid:14)1C1 ^ (cid:11) ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ f(cid:11)g ‘ fTrueg, where i is the first indexsuch that (cid:11) is consistent with (cid:14)i .(b) If B D fp; q; Trueg, we can use the stratification B D fp; qg [ fTrueg to compute therevised base B(cid:6)(cid:11). In the particular case where (cid:11) D :.p ^ q/, we findB(cid:6):.p ^ q/ D f:.p ^ q/ ^ .p _ q/; :.p ^ q/; Trueg;which is equal, up to classical equivalence, to the setf.p ^ :q/ _ .:p ^ q/; :.p ^ q/; Trueg:M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134117This result conforms with our intuition that revising B by the formula :.p ^ q/exactly means that one at least of the elements p and q has to be discarded.We close this section with a list of some elementary properties of the full meet baseoperator (cid:6), to which we shall return in Section 6. A detailed analysis and a discussionon the meaning of these properties in the framework of belief revision is made in [5].

The dynamics of induced systemsSo far, the results we have established concern the correspondence between default setsand inference relations in the Poole–Shoham duality. They can be considered as a study ofthe statics of default systems. From now on, we shall adopt a different point of view andstudy the effect of a perturbation of a set D on its induced inference relation.In studying the dynamics of induced systems, it is useful to consider a set of defaultsD (cid:18) L as representing a basic information that completely specifies the inference processof an agent. This process, symbolized by the inference relation j(cid:24)D induced by D, enablesthe agent to jump from a premiss (cid:11) to the conclusion (cid:12) in all cases where (cid:11) ! (cid:12) isclassically entailed by the maximal (cid:11)-consistent subsets of D. The role of the set D,analyzed as a set of data generating an inference relation, is thus reminiscent of that playedby belief states (or, more precisely, by belief bases) in belief revision theory. Neverthelessthis analogy is purely formal. In revision theory, the agent disposes of a set of beliefs K andof a revision operator (cid:3): in the presence of some piece of information (cid:11), the agent proceedsto a revision of her original beliefs, so that (cid:11) becomes part of the new set of beliefs K (cid:3) (cid:11).The transformation K ! K (cid:3) (cid:11) is required to obey some elementary principles, like theAGM extended set of postulates. In this perspective, a conclusion (cid:12) will be inferred from(cid:11) iff (cid:12) is a member of the revised set of beliefs K (cid:3) (cid:11). In other words, (cid:12) is a consequenceof (cid:11) iff it is not possible to incorporate (cid:11) in the agent’s belief without incorporating (cid:12) aswell. In this framework, the subjectivity of the agent is present at two different stages. First,for the agent, the language L in its whole reduces to a collection of pieces of informationthat are evaluated comparatively to the belief base K: in order to decide whether (cid:12) followsfrom (cid:11), the agent has to pretend that the information encoded by (cid:11) is more reliable than the118M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134information encoded by K. Next, it should be emphasized that it is the agent that choosesthe revision process (cid:3) in the context given by the set K and the formula (cid:11) at hand. Quitedifferent from this is the framework of induced systems .D; j(cid:24)D/, where the set D is notsupposed to reflect the current beliefs of the agent but, rather, is meant to encode some basicinformation that will be used as a criterion by the agent to build up her beliefs or determineher behavior. In this perspective, where .D; j(cid:24)D/ may be considered as an expert systemthat enables the agent to draw conclusions modulo D via the inference process j(cid:24)D, anyperturbation of the set D has to be studied, first of all, through its effect on the inducedrelation j(cid:24)D, and the dynamics of induced systems thus fundamentally differs from theclassical theories of belief revision, where additional pieces of information are consideredonly through their effect on the set D.In this paper, we shall not discuss the general problem of the influence, on the inducedinference relation, of arbitrary changes in the original default set; we will only deal withsome elementary dynamical problems. First, we shall discuss the problem of rationalizingan inference relation, and present some solutions that can be used to transform into arational relation the preferential inference relation induced by an arbitrary set of defaults.Then we will restrict our attention to stratified sets of defaults and introduce a full meetrevision operator analogue to the one introduced in the preceding section. As we shall see,this operator will prove to be an important tool in the problem of base revision, where onehas to change the original set of defaults in order to take into account a new information. Inthe last part of this section, we shall deal with the problem of conditional revision, whichoccurs when a set of defaults has to be revised in order to entail a particular conditionalthat was not initially part of the induced relation.5. Rationalizing an inference processSince rational inference relations play a central role in the field of nonmonotonicreasoning, it is natural to expect from an agent a rational behavior, i.e., an inferenceprocess in which the rule of rational monotony is satisfied. As we saw, the behavior ofan agent is fully determined by a set of defaults which we will consider as representingall the available information, and rationalizing the agent’s behavior therefore amounts tocorrecting a default set that primitively came to induce an irrational inference process.We are therefore considering the following situation: starting with a set of defaultsD (cid:18) L, we want to transform it into a set Dr so that the induced inference relationj(cid:24)Dr is rational. In looking for a solution of this problem, we have to take into accountsome elementary principles that may determine our choice between different possiblerationalizations. Before all, it seems clear that a minimality principle has to be respectedduring the rationalization process. This minimal change principle may be differentlyinterpreted, as one may focus either on the default set itself, or on the induced inferencerelation. In the present framework, as noted in the beginning of this section, priority isgiven to the induced relation, and changes on the default set can be justified only throughtheir effect on the induced relation. We shall therefore first take into account the principle:R-1 Minimal change of inferences. The revised inference relation should differ as littleas possible from the original one.M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134119For practical reasons, it may also be desirable to keep as much as possible fromthe original set of defaults. For instance, a rationalization procedure D ! Dr will beacceptable only if it keeps invariant the sets D that already induce a rational inferencerelation, that is the stratified sets. Thus, together with R-1, we might take into considerationthe principle:R-2 Minimal change of information. The information encoded in the revised set ofdefaults should differ as little as possible from the original one.Another principle can be added to R-1 and R-2, according to which no belief should belost in the rationalizing process: by this, we mean that is a conclusion (cid:12) could be initiallyentailed from the premiss (cid:11) through the set of defaults D, this conclusion should remainvalid when D changes into Dr , so that, in the presence of (cid:11), the agent will still believe init. This can be put in the following beliefs-preservation principle:R-3 Conditionals are preserved in the revision process.Note that in any revision process D ! Dr , this condition is fulfilled if and only if theDr , and thatD is a sub-relation of the new relation j(cid:24)original induced inference relation j(cid:24)this amounts to require the inclusion <D (cid:18) <Dr .Finally, in the particular case of rationalization, one may consider the reliability of thechosen rationalization operator: by this we mean that if two sets of defaults D and D0induce the same inference relation (in which case we will say that they are equivalent),then the rationalized sets Dr and D0r should also induce the same rational relation. Thiscan be put into a fourth principle:R-4 Equivalence of default sets is preserved through rationalization.Principles R-1 to R-4 may be used in defining a set of postulates for rationalization. Inthis paper, we shall only present and compare two process of rationalization: the first onehas the feature of being fairly simple and intuitive, while the second one seems to be thebest solution to the rationalization problem with respect to the above principles.5.1. Chaining the set DSince the rationalized set Dr is supposed to induce a rational inference relation, thisset must be stratified, and the problem therefore boils down to transform the original set Dinto a stratified set. As the simple examples of such sets are provided by logical chains, onemay require the set Dr itself to be a logical chain. In this perspective, the rationalizationproblem amounts to construct a suitable logical chain from an arbitrary set D. The mostnatural way to build such a chain may be given by the following procedure, evoked in [4]:^ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ^ (cid:11)ik /,where the disjunction is taken over all k-tuples of different elements of D (it may be thecase that gk D False). Set c.D/ D f(cid:13)card D; (cid:13)card D(cid:0)1; : : : ; (cid:13)1; Trueg. This set clearly has theFor any integer k 6 card D, denote by (cid:13)k the formula (cid:13)k D^ (cid:11)i2.(cid:11)i1W120M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134structure of a logical chain with 1 C card D elements, that can be directly computed fromthe set D. It thus provides a rationalization of the inference relation induced by D.Example 18 (Penguins). We compute the chain c.D/ in the case where D is the setf(cid:11); (cid:12); (cid:13) g with (cid:11) D p ! b; (cid:12) D b ! f and (cid:13) D p ! :f . The order < induced by DisWe have(cid:13)3 D (cid:11) ^ (cid:12) ^ (cid:13) D :p ^ .b ! f /;(cid:13)2 D .(cid:11) ^ (cid:12)/ _ .(cid:11) ^ (cid:13) / _ .(cid:12) ^ (cid:13) / D :p _ b _ :f;(cid:13)1 D (cid:11) _ (cid:12) _ (cid:13) D True;and the chain c.D/ is therefore equal to .:p _ .b ! f /; :p _ b _ :f; True/. The rankedmodel associated with the rational inference relation induced by c.D/ ispfpbf b pb p(cid:3) f bf210One easily checks that the induced order <c.D/ satisfies m <c.D/ n iff m satisfies moreformulae in D than n, that is iff card.formD.n// < card.formD.m//. This interestingproperty holds in the general case:Observation 19. If <c.D denotes the order induced by c.D/ on W , one has for any worldm; m <c.D/ n iff card.formD.n// < card.formD.m//.The proof is straightforward, observing that a world m satisfies a number k of elementsof D iff it satisfies (cid:13)k ^ :(cid:13)kC1, that is iff formc.D/.m/ D f(cid:13)i j 1 6 i 6 kg:The chaining procedure described above provides an easy way to rationalize theinference relation induced by a set D, by directly reorganizing this set into a logical chain.As shown by Observation 19, this procedure can be performed even when the originalinduced order is not explicitly given, and it only requires the knowledge, for each world,of the number of elements of D satisfied by this world. Thus the rationalized inferencerelation can be directly computed from the value, for each world m, of card.formD.m/; inM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134121this sense, it is, by far, the most natural and the simplest of the rationalization procedureswe know of.Example 20. Consider, in the propositional language built on the three variables p; qand r, the set D D f(cid:11)1; (cid:11)2; (cid:11)3; (cid:11)4; (cid:11)5; (cid:11)6g with (cid:11)1 D .p _ r/ ^ :q; (cid:11)2 D :p; (cid:11)3 Dq ^ :r; (cid:11)4 D : _ q _ r; (cid:11)5 D :q _ .:p ^ r/ and (cid:11)6 D :r ^ .p _ q/. We write thecorresponding Boolean matrix, where the intersection of the ith line and the j th column isequal to 1 iff the corresponding world satisfies the corresponding formula:m(cid:3)pqrpqprqrpqr(cid:11)1 (cid:11)2 (cid:11)3 (cid:11)4 (cid:11)5 (cid:11)6cardDform.m/01010100101100100010100010111111110101100110100033443331Applying Observation 19, we can directly display the ranked model associated withc.D/:j(cid:24)pqr(cid:3) p pq pr qrq r210Let us now briefly test this chaining procedure with respect to the principles discussed inthe last paragraph: since the set c.D/ is built up from D by conjunction and disjunction, wecan consider that the principle R-2 of minimal change of information is fairly satisfied. Fur-thermore, it readily follows from Observation 19 that <D (cid:18) <c.D/, so that beliefs are pre-served through the chaining process, which meets the requirements of principle R-3. Never-theless, the above chaining procedure does not satisfy the principle R-1 of minimal changein the induced relation. Computing the order <D induced by D, one gets indeed the modelshowing that the minimality of p is lost in the chaining process.122M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134Even more, this rationalization process suffers from an important shortcoming, as it maybe the case that two sets D and D0 induce the same inference relation, while the rationalrelations induced by c.D/ and c.D0/ differ. This may even occur when D is already astratified set:Example 21. Let L be built on the two propositional variables p and q, and D Dfp ^ q; :q; :p ^ q; qg. We have formD.(cid:3)/ D formd.p/ D f:qg, formD.q/ D fq; :p ^ qgand formD.pq/ D fq; p ^ qg. It follows that the induced order <D is the empty relation,so that j(cid:24)D is the classical consequence ‘. Nevertheless, the order induced by c.D/ is notempty: one has indeed q <c.D/(cid:3).The failure of R-1 and of R-4 shows that, in spite of its attractive simplicity, the chainingprocedure D ! c.D/ cannot be considered as an ideal solution to the rationalizationproblem. It seems that the best compromise between simplicity and efficiency may befound in the rational closure process that we present now.5.2. Rational closureThe construction that Lehmann and Magidor proposed in [12] to extend an arbitraryset of conditional assertions can be successfully applied to rationalize induced inferencerelations, and provides a rationalization operator D ! Dr:c: that meets all the requirementsof principles R-1, R-3 and R-4. This construction is performed in the following way (cf.Section 5.7 of [12] for details):Let .W; </ be the standard model associated with a faithfully representable inferencerelation j(cid:24). For any world m, define the height of m as the length of a maximal sequencem1 < m2 < (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) < mk < m. The rational closure of < is then the order <r:c defined bym <r:c n iff the height of m is strictly less than that of n. The relation <r:c is then amodular order that extends <. The rational inference relation j(cid:24)r:c represented by themodel .W; <r:c/ is called the rational closure of j(cid:24). Its induced ranking (cid:20)r:c satisfies(cid:20)r:c.m/ D height.m/.Given an arbitrary set of defaults D, we define the rational closure Dr:c of D to be thelogical chain associated with the rational closure of the relation j(cid:24)D induced by D. Wehave thus Dr:c D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)h D Trueg where, for all indices i; (cid:14)i is the formula such thatm jD (cid:14)i iff m is of height less or equal to i.Example 20 (Continued). Computing the height of each world from the model .W; <D/of Example 20, we get the following ranked model for the rational closure of <D:pqr(cid:3) qr pr pqp q r210The characteristic associated chain isDr:c D f.p ^ :q ^ :r/ _ .:p ^ q ^ :r/ _ .:p ^ :q ^ r/; :p _ :q _ :r; Trueg:M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134123It follows from the general properties of rational closure that the rationalization processit generates fully matches the requirements of the principles R-1 and R-3 of minimalbelief change and belief preservation. As it also satisfies the principle R-4—two equivalentdefault sets induce the same order on W , and their rational closures therefore coincide—this rational closure process provides quite an acceptable solution to the problem ofrationalizing the inference induced by an arbitrary set of defaults D. It seems, though, thatsome improvement could be found in the construction of the rationalized default set Dr:c:we defined very simply this set to be the logical chain associated with the rational closure ofthe original relation j(cid:24)D, but any set inducing this relation and “closer” to D would providea better solution. In this sense, we shall consider the rationalization problem as completelysolved only once we will be able to find an rationalization operator D ! Dr such that Drinduces the rational closure of j(cid:24)D and agrees with D whenever D is stratified.6. Base revisionWhen considering a set of formulae D as the knowledge base of an expert systemthat determines the inference process j(cid:24)D of an agent, one has to analyze the problemof adding or retracting an information in a different perspective than in the classical theoryof belief change. Basically, no problem is encountered if one wishes to incorporate in Da new element (cid:11) representing a piece of information or a rule that has to be taken intoaccount: indeed, since D may be quite an arbitrary set, generally not closed under classicalconsequence and not even consistent, it is enough to replace it by the set D [ f(cid:11)g or the setD (cid:0) f(cid:11)g. Nevertheless, we already noted in the last paragraph that first place must be givento the induced inference relation, and it is through this relation that changes in D haveto be studied and evaluated. Some elementary principles therefore have to be observed inthis perspective, and, before all, that of rationality preservation: if the inference relationinduced by the original set D is rational, so must be the inference relation induced by therevised set D (cid:3) (cid:11). Note, however, that violations of this principle are quite conceivable, as itis always possible to rationalize the relation induced by the revised set through its rationalclosure. This could lead to a stronger rational closure preservation principle, requiring theequality Dr:c (cid:3) (cid:11) D .D (cid:3) (cid:11)/r:c: the revision by (cid:11) of the rationalized set Dr:c agrees withthe rationalization of the revised set D (cid:3) (cid:11). In this study, though, we shall only considerstratified sets, on which we shall apply the full meet base revision operator (cid:6). This operatorwas defined as follows: for any stratified set D with stratification .Dj / and any consistentformula (cid:11), let i be the first index such that Di is (cid:11)-consistent, and (cid:12)1; (cid:12)2; : : : ; (cid:12)n .n > 0/the elements of Di(cid:0)1 that are consistent with (cid:11). The full meet base revision of D by (cid:11) isthe setD(cid:6)(cid:11) D f(cid:11) ^ .(cid:12)1 _ (cid:12)2 _ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) _ (cid:12)n/g.(cid:11) ^ Dk/ [ fTrueg:[k>iIn order to incorporate some new data (cid:11) into a stratified set D, it is quite natural toconsider the set D(cid:6)(cid:11). The operator (cid:6) may thus be used in the framework of inducedsystems as a tool to revise a set of defaults by a formula (cid:11). As (cid:6) maps stratified sets intostratified sets, the principle of rationality preservation is satisfied. The explanation and the124M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134justification of properties FM1–FM7 remain quite relevant to the perspective adopted inthis section, where D is not anymore seen as a belief base but, rather, as a set of itemsgenerating an inference process. It turns out, though, that in the framework of inducedsystems, the best results are obtained with the help of a tail added to the operator (cid:6):The tailed operator (cid:7) is defined, for any stratified set D, by D(cid:7)(cid:11) D .D(cid:6)(cid:11)/ [ .(cid:11) _ D/.Clearly, if a set Di satisfies condition (2) of Definition 10, so does the set (cid:11) _ Di , sothat D(cid:7)(cid:11) is a stratified set. The revision of D by (cid:11) obtained through the operator (cid:7) enjoyproperties similar to that of (cid:6). In particular, one has readily Cn.D(cid:7)(cid:11)/ D Cn.D(cid:6)(cid:11)/ D D(cid:3)(cid:11),so that (cid:7) induces an AGM revision. We want to investigate the effect of this revisionoperation on the inference relation induced by D.Let CD be the rational inference relation induced by the stratified set D, and CD(cid:7)(cid:11)the rational inference relation induced by the full meet base revision D(cid:7)(cid:11) of D by theconsistent formula (cid:11). Our aim is to investigate the link existing between these to relations.To do so, it is convenient to make use of the associated characteristic sets.Lemma 22. The characteristic set associated with D(cid:7)(cid:11) is equal to (cid:9) (cid:7)(cid:11), where (cid:9) is thecharacteristic set associated with D.Proof. We use the notations of Observation 13: if (cid:17)i is the conjunction of the elementsof Di , and (cid:17)0D True, we have (cid:9) Df(cid:17)i; (cid:17)0j 1 6 i 6 h C 1g. Let i be the first index such that (cid:11) is consistent with Di , and (cid:12)1,i(cid:12)2; : : : ; (cid:12)n .n > 0/ the (cid:11)-consistent elements of Di(cid:0)1. We have theni their disjunction .1 6 i 6 h/, setting (cid:17)hC1 D (cid:17)0hC1D(cid:7)(cid:11) D f(cid:11) ^ .(cid:12)1 _ (cid:12)2 _ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) _ (cid:12)n/.(cid:11) ^ Dk/ [ .(cid:11) _ D/ [ fTrueg:[k>iNote that the formula (cid:11) ^ .(cid:12)1 _ (cid:12)2 _ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) _ (cid:12)n/ is equal modulo classical equivalence to theformula (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)0i(cid:0)1. Using the remark made after Example 14, we see that the characteristicset associated with D(cid:7)(cid:11) is(cid:8)(cid:9)i(cid:0)1; (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)i; (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)0i ; (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)iC1; : : : ; (cid:11)[(cid:11) _ (cid:17)j ; (cid:11)_0jj 1 6 j 6 h C 1(cid:8)(cid:11) ^ (cid:17)0(cid:9):This set is precisely equal to (cid:9) (cid:7)(cid:11). 2We can now easily establish the link existing between the relations CD and CD(cid:7)(cid:11),respectively, induced by D and by D(cid:7)(cid:11). By the above lemma, we have CD(cid:7)(cid:11) D C(cid:9) (cid:7)(cid:11). Let(cid:13) be an arbitrary formula. If (cid:13) is inconsistent with (cid:11), we have CD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) / D Cn.(cid:13) ; (cid:11) _ (cid:17)i/where i is the first index such that (cid:17)i is consistent with (cid:13) . Thus, in this case, we haveCD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) / D CD.(cid:13) /. If now (cid:13) is consistent with (cid:11), let j be the first index such that(cid:13) is consistent with (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)j . We have therefore CD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) / D Cn.(cid:13) ; (cid:11) ^ (cid:17)j /. But j isthe first index such that the element (cid:17)j of (cid:9) is consistent with (cid:11) ^ (cid:13) . It follows thatCn.(cid:13) ; (cid:11)^j / D Cn.(cid:11) ^ (cid:13) ; (cid:17)j D C(cid:9) .(cid:13) / D CD.(cid:13) /. We have therefore proven theTheorem 23. For all formulae (cid:13) , one has CD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) / D CD.(cid:11) ^ (cid:13) / if (cid:13) is consistent with(cid:11), and CD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) / D CD.(cid:13) / otherwise.This result shows that the process of revision by the tailed operator enjoys two propertiesthat make it well adapted to the framework of induced systems. The first one is that theM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134125consequences of a premiss (cid:13) will remain unchanged after any revision by an information(cid:11) that (cid:13) contradicts. From the knowledge base D D fp ! b; b ! f g for instance, an agentwill infer that penguin generally fly .p j(cid:24)D f /, and there is no reason why this conclusionshould be invalidated after the agent learns that penguin do not exist .:p/. A secondinteresting feature of tailed revision is that, as shown by Theorem 23, the consequencesof a premiss (cid:13) are preserved through the revision by (cid:11) whenever :(cid:11) was not part of theseconsequences: indeed, if :(cid:11) =2 CD.(cid:13) /, we have, by rationality, CD.(cid:13) / (cid:18) CD.(cid:11) ^ (cid:13) /, thatis CD.(cid:13) / (cid:18) CD(cid:7)(cid:11).(cid:13) /. Thus the revision of a stratified default set by the tailed operator(cid:7) provides an optimal solution to the problem of minimal change, at the level of theknowledge base as well as that of the induced inference relation.We shall now turn our attention to the last problem of the dynamics of default reasoningand devote the next sections to the study of conditional revision.7. Conditional changeIn the preceding section, the revision of a default set D was considered in the perspectivewhere a formula (cid:11) had to be incorporated in the knowledge base D. In this base revisionproblem, the attention was focused before all on the set of defaults, and the solutions hadto meet some requirements—the principle of minimal change, or of categorial matching,for instance—analogous to those that govern the theory of belief change. Quite differentis the problem of conditional revision, that occurs when it appears desirable to force achange of the agent’s behavior in some specific situation: for instance, we might requirethe agent to accept the conditional p ^ b j(cid:24) f , so that in her beliefs, penguin birds willnormally fly, although such a conditional was not entailed from the initial set of defaults.Alternatively, we could require that the agent gives up a conditional primitively inducedby a set of defaults. The purpose of conditional revision is therefore to modify, through amodification of the set D, the inference relation induced by D. This problem splits intotwo parts. In the first one, one wishes to perform a conditional contraction in order toretract a given conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12), and one builds a set D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ that will not entailthis conditional. In the second one, one wishes to perform a conditional revision: givena set of defaults D and a conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) that is not induced by D, one tries to builda set D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ that will entail the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12). In both cases, the role playedby the set D is secondary, as is the link between D and the revised sets D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ orD (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/; our guiding line is the success of the operation: the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) hasto be entailed by D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/, and should not be entailed by D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/. Apart fromthis success postulate, both principles R-1 (minimal change of inferences) and R-3 (beliefpreservation) will be determinant when comparing the value of different solutions. Thus,in the case of conditional contraction, principle R-1 commands that no new conditionalshould be added and that a minimal number of conditionals should be discarded, so thatthe revised inference relation should be a sub-relation of the original one, maximal amongthe sub-relations that do not entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12); similarly, in the case of conditional revision, itfollows from R-1 and R-2 that the revised inference relation should contain the originalone and be minimal among those that entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12).126M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134For simplicity, we will limit our study to rational induced relations. Since the sets ofdefaults are taken into account only in as much as they generate an inference relation, wewill always suppose that these sets have the structure of a logical chain. As a matter offact, we will see that solutions to the chain conditional revision problem are not easilyapplicable to the general case of stratified sets.7.1. Conditional contractionBy what precedes, the result of a contraction of a rational inference C should be arational sub-relation of C. It is therefore important to compare the characteristic chainof C with that of a sub-relation:Lemma 24. Let C and C0 be two rational inference relations with associated characteris-tic sets (cid:9) and (cid:9) 0. Then C0 is a sub-relation of C iff (cid:9) 0 is a subset of (cid:9) .Let us now examine the problem of conditional contraction: we suppose given a setD D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)n D Trueg such that (cid:14)i ‘ (cid:14)iC1 for all indices i < n, and a conditional(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) induced by D. We have thus (cid:12) 2 C.(cid:11)/, where C the rational relation induced by D.Our aim is to build a set D0 that has the structure of a logical chain .(cid:14)01; : : : ; True/ withinduced relation C0 that satisfies C0 (cid:18) C and (cid:12) =2 C0.(cid:11)/. Clearly, this problem admits nosolution in the case where (cid:11) ‘ (cid:12), and we shall therefore suppose that (cid:12) is not a classicalconsequence of (cid:11). By Lemma 24, we can see that this problem amounts to choose a subsetD0 of D for which (cid:11) j(cid:24)D0 (cid:12) does not hold. Such subsets D0 are easy to determine:0; (cid:14)0Observation 25. Let D0 D .(cid:14)0k/ be a sub-chain of D D .(cid:14)l/, and (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) a conditionalentailed by D and not entailed by D0. If i is the first index such that (cid:14)i is consistent with (cid:11)and j the first index such that (cid:14)j is consistent with (cid:11) ^ :(cid:12), one has j > i and (cid:14)06D (cid:14)s forkall indices k and s such that i (cid:0) 1 < s < j .This result states that, in order not to entail the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) primitively entailedby D, it is necessary to retract from D at least the sub-chain (cid:14)i ‘ (cid:14)iC1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ (cid:14)j (cid:0)1.Proof. Let < be the modular order induced on W by D. Since we have (cid:11) j(cid:24)D (cid:12), any<-minimal world that satisfies (cid:11) must satisfy (cid:12). By the choice of i, the minimal worlds thatsatisfy (cid:11) have rank i, and any world of rank i therefore satisfies :(cid:11) _ (cid:12). This shows that(cid:14)i ‘ :(cid:11) _ (cid:12), hence that i < j . Suppose now that there exists elements (cid:14)0k of D0 such that(cid:14)0D (cid:14)s 2 f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)j (cid:0)1g.kt is consistent with (cid:11)), so that the <0-minimal worlds thatBy the choice of i; r D Min.t j (cid:14)0satisfy (cid:11) satisfy (cid:14)0r is inconsistent with (cid:11) ^ :(cid:12), such minimalworlds satisfy (cid:12). This leads to (cid:11) j(cid:24)2 f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)j (cid:0)1g, and let r be the first index such that (cid:14)0rr . Since, by the choice of j , (cid:14)0D0 (cid:12), contradicting our hypothesis. 2By what precedes, any solution to the conditional contraction problem necessarilyboils down to choose a “best” element among the family of the subsets D0 of D (cid:0)f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)j (cid:0)1g. It turns out that the maximum element of this family, the whole setD (cid:0) f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)j (cid:0)1g, does the job (as do, in fact, all the elements of this family):M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134127indeed, the chain associated with the set D0 D D (cid:0) f(cid:14)i; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; (cid:14)j (cid:0)1g is the chain(cid:14)0 ‘ (cid:14)1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 ‘ (cid:14)j ‘ (cid:14)j C1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ True. The first element of this chain that isconsistent with (cid:11) is the element (cid:14)j , which is consistent with (cid:11) ^ (cid:12). It follows that thereexists a world m, <0-minimal among those that satisfy (cid:11), such that m satisfies :(cid:12). This isequivalent to say that one does not have (cid:11) j(cid:24)D0 (cid:12).We can now summarize our results, observing that by the definition of i and j , we havei D j iff C does not entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12).Theorem 26. Let C be a rational inference relation, and (cid:11) and (cid:12) two formulae such that(cid:12) =2 Cn.(cid:11)/. Then there exists a greatest rational sub-relation C0 of C such that (cid:12) =2 C0.(cid:11)/.If C is induced by the logical chain (cid:14)0 ‘ (cid:14)1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ True; C0 is induced by the sub-chain(cid:14)0 ‘ (cid:14)1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) ‘ (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 ‘ (cid:14)j ‘ (cid:14)j C1 ‘ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) True, where i is the first index such that (cid:14)i isconsistent with (cid:11), and j is the first index such that (cid:14)j is consistent with (cid:11) ^ :(cid:12).If D is the set f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; Trueg, the characteristic chain of the relation C0 will bereferred to as the contraction of D by the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12), and denoted by D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/.Note that D D D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ iff D does not entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12).Example 18 (Continued). We have seen that the chain D D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; (cid:14)2g with (cid:14)0 D :p ^.b ! f /; (cid:14)1 D :p _ b _ :f and (cid:14)2 D True induced the following rankingpbfpfb(cid:3) fpb pbf210Note that D entails the conditional p ^ f j(cid:24) b, so that, for any agent using the expertsystem .D; j(cid:24)D/, penguins that fly are normally birds. Let us determine the contractionD (cid:4) .p ^ f j(cid:24) b/ of D by p ^ f j(cid:24) b: with the above notation, we have i D 1 and j D 2.The result of this contraction is therefore the set D (cid:4) .p ^ f j(cid:24) b/ D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)2g, inducing theranked modelpfpbf b pb p(cid:3) f bf10It is possible to directly display the ranking associated with the revised default setD0 D D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/, without computing explicitly the elements of this chain: note indeedthat we have i D Min.(cid:20).m/ j m jD (cid:11)/ and j D Min.(cid:20).m/ j m jD (cid:11) ^ :(cid:12)/ where (cid:20) is theranking associated with D.

The ranked model associated with D0 is thereforeobtained from the original model by putting at the same (cid:20) 0-rank all the worlds m such thati 6 (cid:20).m/ < j . In the above example, for instance, worlds of rank 1 and of rank 2 move atthe same level.128M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–1347.2. Conditional revisionIn this section, we consider the problem of conditional revision, dual to the one ofconditional contraction: given a conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) that is not entailed by a logical chain D,we want to perform changes on D in order to get a chain D0 that entails (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12). Considerfor instance the set D of the preceding example. The ranked model associated with D waspbfpfb(cid:3) fpb pbf210which did not entail p ^ b j(cid:24) f since the world pb, minimal in Mof.p ^ b/, does notsatisfy f . If it appears desirable that, in the agent’s beliefs, penguin-birds fly, one has tomodify the knowledge base D into a set D0 that yields the conditional p ^ b j(cid:24) b.Let C and C0 be the rational relations induced by D and the set D0 we are looking for.By hypothesis, we have (cid:12) =2 C.(cid:11)/, and C0 has the property that (cid:12) 2 C0.(cid:11)/. In view of thebelief preservation principle, C must be a sub-relation of C0. Nevertheless, this will beimpossible if :(cid:12) 2 C.(cid:11)/, since, in this case, C0 would not be consistency-preserving. Itwill be therefore necessary to first perform a conditional contraction, in order to retract theconditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12) from C.We suppose this has been done, so that, possibly after a contraction, the set D doesnot entail the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12). It is then possible to consider the family of rationalextensions of C that entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12), and to choose for C0 a minimal element of thisfamily. By Lemma 24 indeed, this amounts to build a minimal chain D0 D .(cid:14)0i/ extendingD D .(cid:14)j /, with (cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11); (cid:14)0j /, where j is the first index such that (cid:11) is consistent with(cid:14)0i. The procedure we propose is the following one: denote by i the first index such that(cid:11) is consistent with (cid:14)i . We simply define the conditional revision D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ of D by.(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ to be the set D0 D .(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)i ^ .:(cid:11) _ (cid:12)/; (cid:14)i ; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; True/ thatis obtained from D by adding the single formula (cid:14)0 D (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)i ^ .:(cid:11) _ (cid:12)/. Observe thatthe hypothesis :(cid:12) =2 C.(cid:11)/ D Cn.(cid:11); (cid:14)i/ implies that (cid:14)0 is the first element of the chain D0that is consistent with (cid:11). Since we have readily (cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11); (cid:14)0/, we see that, as desired, theconditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12) is entailed by the revised set D0. Note that the sets D and D0 coincideiff (cid:12) 2 Cn.(cid:11); (cid:14)i/ that is iff D already entailed the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12).It is easy to describe the semantics of the rational relation induced by the set D0 definedas above: the revised ranking (cid:20) 0 is given by (cid:20) 0.m/ D (cid:20).m/ if (cid:20).m/ 6 i (cid:0) 1; (cid:20) 0.m/ D i if(cid:20).m/ D i and m jD :(cid:11) _ (cid:12), and (cid:20) 0.m/ D (cid:20).m/ C 1 otherwise. Thus, a new rank has simplybeen added between the original ranks i and i C 1, which consists of all worlds m thatsatisfy :(cid:12) and had minimal (cid:20)-rank in mod.(cid:11)/.Example 18 (Continued). Consider the chain D D f(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; (cid:14)2g of Example 18, with (cid:14)0 D:p ^ .b ! f /; (cid:14)1 D :p _ b _ :f and (cid:14)2 D True, inducing the rankingM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134129pbfpfb(cid:3) fpb pbf210To perform the revision of D by p ^ b j(cid:24) f , we determine the first index i such that (cid:14)iis consistent with p ^ b. We find i D 1. The revised chain is thereforeD0 D D (cid:3) .p ^ b j(cid:24) f /D .:p ^ .b ! f /; :p ^ .b ! f / _ T.:p _ :b _ :f / ^ .:p _ :b _ f /U;:p _ b _ f; True/;that is0 D .:p ^ .:b _ f /; :p _ T.b _ :f / ^ .:b _ f /U; :p _ b _ f; True/:DThe induced (cid:20) 0 ranking ispfpbp b pbf(cid:3) f bf3210The world pb, that satisfies :f , had (cid:20)-rank 1 and was minimal in mod.p ^ b/. In the newranking, it is given rank 2. The conditional p ^ b j(cid:24) f is now entailed by D0.It is clear that there exists several minimal solutions to the conditional revision problem.Instead of adding to D the formula (cid:14)0 D (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)i ^ .:(cid:11) _ (cid:12)/, we could have consideredfor instance the set D00 D D [ f(cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)i ^ (cid:12)/g, that also entails the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12).The choice of (cid:14)0 is nevertheless imposed by the principle R-2 of minimal change inthe default set: one shows indeed easily that if (cid:14)00 is a formula such that the chain.(cid:14)0; : : : ; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1; (cid:14)00; (cid:14)1; (cid:14)iC1; : : : ; True/ induces the conditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12), then (cid:14)00 ‘ (cid:14)0. In thissense, the solution we presented here may be considered as the best solution to conditionalrevision.So far, we supposed that the initial set of defaults D did not entail the conditional(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12), and mentioned that it was always possible to retract this conditional if thiscondition was not satisfied. By this, we mean that we define the revision of D by .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/as the set .D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12)// (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/. Using the results of the preceding section, wehave D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12)/ D .(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1; (cid:14)j ; (cid:14)j C1; : : : ; True/, where i is the first index suchthat (cid:14)i is consistent with (cid:11), and j the first index such that (cid:14)j is consistent with (cid:11) ^ (cid:12).Note that (cid:14)j becomes the first element of the contracted chain D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12)/ that isconsistent with (cid:11). Recall that, as observed before, we have D D D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12)/ iff Ddoes not entail (cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12). We finally proceed to the revision of D (cid:4) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) :(cid:12)/ by (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)130M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134as described above, and get the chain D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ equal to .(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; : : : ; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)j ^.:(cid:11) _ (cid:12)//; (cid:14)j ; (cid:14)j C1; : : : ; True/. This proves theTheorem 27. Given two formulae (cid:11) and (cid:12) such that (cid:12) is consistent with (cid:11), there existsa unique conditional revision process that fully satisfies the principles R-1, R-2 and R-3 and transforms a logical chain D into a logical chain D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ inducing theconditional (cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12). If i is the first index such that (cid:14)i is consistent with (cid:11), and j thefirst index such that (cid:14)j is consistent with (cid:11) ^ (cid:12), the chain D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ is equal to.(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1; (cid:14)i(cid:0)1 _ .(cid:14)j ^ .:(cid:11) _ (cid:12)//; (cid:14)j ; (cid:14)j C1; : : : ; True/.The semantics induced by D (cid:3) .(cid:11) j(cid:24) (cid:12)/ is easily described, using first the semantics ofconditional contractions.Example 28. Consider, in the language built on the three variables p; q; r, the chainD D .(cid:14)0; (cid:14)1; (cid:14)2; True/, where (cid:14)0 D p ^ q ^ r; (cid:14)1 D q ^ .p _ r/; (cid:14)2 D p _ q _ r.

Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–1341318. Conclusion and further workIn studying the relations between a set of formulae and its induced inference relation,we were able to establish interesting results in several important domains that either haveto do with the statics of induced systems (e.g., our characterization of the analogue ofrationality in the Poole–Shoham duality), or concern problems linked to the dynamics ofthese systems, like those of rationalization or of conditional revision. The solutions thatwe proposed are effective and adequate, but it is clear that some improvements have to befound in several points. Let us mention two of them: first, the problem of rationalizationthrough rational closure cannot be considered as settled, since it is far from satisfying theprinciple of base-minimal change. An ideal solution would provide, from an arbitrary setD, a stratified set Dr that 1) would induce the rational closure of the inference relationinduced by D, and 2) would minimally differ from D. In the solution we presented,the rationalized set was taken to be a logical chain, which, in fact, had little to do withthe original set D. The second improvement that can be searched in the dynamics ofinduced systems is the possibility to extend to arbitrary stratified sets the constructionsof conditional contractions and revisions that were made in Section 7 for logical chains.It would be interesting to know if, in the general framework of stratified sets, a uniquesolution could still be proposed for this revision problem.It should be finally emphasized that the present work only dealt with logically finitelanguages: in an arbitrary propositional language, it is possible to apply these results whendealing with finite sets of defaults by considering an adequate finite sub-language, but, inthe general case, nothing is known about the relationship between the structure of a set ofdefaults and that of its induced inference relation. Among the open problems in this arearemains that, evoked in a preceding paper, of characterizing all the defaults sets that inducea rational inference relation.AcknowledgementI wish to thank the anonymous referees who, by their explicit or implicit remarks, helpedme to improve the presentation of this work.Appendix A. Proofs of lemmas and theoremsLemma 8. Let j(cid:24) be a consistency-preserving rational inference relation defined on alogically finite language, (cid:9) D f i j 0 < i 6 hg its characteristic set and (cid:1) its basic setof defaults. Then a formula (cid:11) is an element of (cid:1) iff (cid:11) ‘ 0 or there exists an indexi; 1 6 i < h, such that i ‘ (cid:11) ‘ iC1.Proof. Suppose first that a formula (cid:11) satisfies the property stated in the lemma and letus prove that (cid:11) 2 (cid:1), i.e., that property .(cid:3)/ holds for (cid:11). Clearly we can suppose that (cid:11)is consistent. Note that it follows from the definition of i that a world p satisfies iiff (cid:20).p/ < i, where (cid:20) is the ranking function associated with j(cid:24). Let n be a world that132M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134satisfies (cid:11). If (cid:11) ‘ 1, we have n jD 1; n is of rank 0, hence n is minimal and the condition.(cid:3)/ is trivially satisfied. If (cid:11) is such that i ‘ (cid:11) m iC1; n is of rank (cid:20).n/ 6 i. For anyworld m < n, we have (cid:20).m/ < i, showing that m satisfies i , hence m jD (cid:11). This showsthat (cid:11) satisfies condition .(cid:3)/ and is therefore an element of (cid:1).Conversely, let (cid:11) be an element of (cid:1). If (cid:11) is a contradiction, we have trivially (cid:11) ‘ 1.If (cid:11) is consistent, let i be rank of a world n of maximal rank that satisfies (cid:11). Any worldm satisfying (cid:11) has therefore a rank (cid:20).m/ 6 i, and therefore satisfies iC1. This showsthat (cid:11) ‘ iC1. If now a world p satisfies i , we have (cid:20).p/ < i D (cid:20).n/, that is p < n. Bycondition .(cid:3)/, we have p jD (cid:11), and this shows that i ‘ (cid:11), completing the proof of thelemma. 2Theorem 12. The inference relation induced by a set D is rational iff D is stratified.Proof. Suppose first that the inference relation induced by D is rational, and let us provethat D is a stratified set. Denote by (cid:9) D f 1; 2; : : : ; hg the characteristic set of theinduced inference relation and by (cid:1) its basic set of defaults. For each index i; 0 < i < h,let (cid:1)i be the subset of (cid:1) consisting of all formulae (cid:11) 2 (cid:1) such that (cid:11) 6D iC1 and i ‘ (cid:11) ‘ iC1. Set (cid:1)0 D f(cid:11) 2 (cid:1) j (cid:11) ‘ 1 and (cid:11) 6D i g and (cid:1)h D fTrueg. We know fromObservation 4 that D (cid:18) (cid:1). For each index i, let Di be the set D \ (cid:1)i (it may be the casethat Di D ;/. The set D is then a disjoint union of the sets Di ’s, and condition (1) ofDefinition 10 is clearly satisfied. To check condition (2), suppose first that i > 0, and letX be a nonempty strict subset of Di determinable in Di . There exists a world n such thatform.n/ \ Di D X. Since n satisfies elements of (cid:1)i , we have (cid:20).n/ 6 i, where (cid:20) is theranking function associated with the rational relation induced by D. Note that, X beinga strict subset of Di , we do not have n jD Di , so that n does not satisfy i . This showsthat .n/ D i, and it follows from condition (1) that formD.n/ D Xj >i Dj . If X werenot a maximal strict determinable subset of Di , there would exist a strict subset Y of Diwith X (cid:26) Y , and a world m such that form.m/ \ Di D Y . As noticed above, this wouldimply (cid:20).m/ D i and formD.m/ D Yj >i Dj . We would then have m <D n, contradictingthe fact that m and n have same rank i. This shows that condition (2) of the definition issatisfied for i > 0. If now X is a strict nonempty determinable subset of D0, and n a worldsuch that form.n/ \ D0 D X, we see that n has rank 0 and is therefore <D-minimal. Oneconcludes, that X is maximal among the determinable strict subsets of D0.SSConversely, let us prove now that the inference relation induced by a stratified set Dis rational. To do so, we shall show that <D is a modular order. We denote by .Di / astratification of D.Let n; m and p be elements of W such that m <D n and not m <D p. We have to checkthat p <D n. Suppose first that formD.n/ D ;. Since we do not have m <D p, the setformD.p/ is not empty, and it follows that p <D n as desired. We are therefore left withthe case where formD.n/ is not empty. Let j be the first index such that form.n/ \ Dj 6D ;.By condition (1) of Definition 10, we have readily form.n/ \ D D form.n/ \ Djk>j Dk .This set is a strict subset of formD.m/, as results from the inequality m <D n. By condition(1) again, we have then form.n/ \ DJ (cid:26) form.m/ \ Dj . Applying now condition (2), wesee that form.m/ \ Dj D Dj , showing that m jD Dj . Since we do not have m <D p,we have either formD.m/ D formD.p/, in which case we get p <D n as desired, orSM. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134133SformD.p/ * formD.m/. In the latter case, there exists an element (cid:11) of D that is satisfied byk>j Dk and, by condition (1), (cid:11) ‘ Dk for all k > j . Sincep and not by m. Clearly, (cid:11) =2Sk>j Dk (cid:18) formD.p/. As m does not satisfy (cid:11), and m <D n; np jD (cid:11), we have then f(cid:11)gdoes not satisfy (cid:11) either, and formD.n/ is therefore a strict subset of f(cid:11)gk>j Dk. Thisleads to formD.n/ (cid:26) formD.p/, showing that p <D n as desired. 2SObservation 13. Let D be a stratified set and .D1; D2; : : : ; Dh/ be a stratification of D.For any index i; 1 6 i 6 h, denote by (cid:17)i the conjunction of all elements of Di , and by (cid:17)0ithe disjunction of all elements of Di . Set (cid:17)hC1 D (cid:17)0D True. Then the characteristic set(cid:9) of the rational inference relation induced by D is equal the set f(cid:17)i ; (cid:17)0j 1 6 i 6 h C 1g.ihC1Proof. Let (cid:9) 0 be the set f(cid:17)i; (cid:17)0j 1 6 i 6 hg. Clearly, (cid:9) 0 has the structure of a logicalichain. To show equality (modulo classical equivalence) between the two logical chains (cid:9)and (cid:9) 0, it is enough to show that they induce the same inference relation, and this amountsto show that check that the induced orders <(cid:9) and <(cid:9) 0 are equal. Since we have <(cid:9) D<D,we have therefore to prove that the orders <D and <(cid:9) 0 coincide, that is that the inequalitym <D n holds iff there exists a formula in (cid:9) 0 that is satisfied by m and not by n.Suppose first that m <D n. Then there exists a formula (cid:11) 2 D that is satisfied by mand not by n. Let i be the first index such that (cid:11) 2 Di . If m satisfies the whole set Di ,we see that the formula (cid:17)i 2 (cid:9) 0 is satisfied by m and not by n. If now form.m/ \ Di is astrict subset of Di , it follows from condition (2) together with the inequality m <D n thatform.n/ \ Di D ;, and thus that the element (cid:17)0i of (cid:9) 0 is satisfied by m and not by n.element is of the form (cid:17)i or (cid:17)0satisfied by n. Condition (1) then implies that formD.m/ (cid:19)SSuppose now that there exists an element of (cid:9) 0 that is satisfied by m and not by n. Thisi . In the first case, m satisfies the whole set Di , which is notj >i Dj while formD.n/ (cid:26)j >i Dj . It follows that m <D n. In the second case, we have form.m/ \ Di 6D ;;Sform.n/ \ Di D ;, and we conclude similarly that m <D n. 2Lemma 24. Let C and C0 be two rational inference relations with associated characteris-tic sets (cid:9) and (cid:9) 0. Then C0 is a sub-relation of C iff (cid:9) 0 is a subset of (cid:9) .Proof. It is immediate that C0 (cid:18) C whenever (cid:9) 0 (cid:18) (cid:9) . Conversely, suppose that C0 isa sub-relation of C. Denote by (cid:20) and (cid:9) 0 the associated rankings and by < and <0 theassociated modular orders. Note that <0 is a sub-relation of <. Let . 01; : : : ; True/and . 0; 1; : : : ; True/ be the characteristic chains associated with C0 and C. Since any<-minimal world is <0-minimal, we have 0 ‘ 0i be any element of (cid:9) 0, and jthe first index such that  0‘ j . We claim that these formulae are equal modulo classicaliequivalence, that is that j ‘  0i . Ifj > 0, there exists a world p that satisfies  0^ : j (cid:0)1. This world has (cid:20)-rank (cid:20).p/ D j .iNote that, for any world m; (cid:20) 0.m/ > i implies (cid:20).m/ > j : indeed, if (cid:20) 0.m/ > i, we havep <0 m, hence p < m, yielding (cid:20).m/ > j . If now a world q satisfies j , we have, by whatprecedes, (cid:20) 0.q/ 6 i, so that q satisfies ‘i . This shows that j ‘ 0i and the proof of thelemma is complete. 2i . If j D 0, this results from the fact that 0 ‘ 00. Let  00; 0‘ 00134M. Freund / Artificial Intelligence 110 (1999) 103–134References[1] C.E. Alchourron, P. Gärdenfors, D.
