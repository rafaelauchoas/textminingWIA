Bacal Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.aBStraCt Flow cytometry (FC) is an essential tool for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic follow-up of several hematologic malignancies. In addition, it performs the quantification of lymphocytes subpopulations for diagnosis and monitoring of primary and acquired immunodeficiencies through the antigenic expressions of CD19 and CD20 for B lymphocytes; CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8 for T lymphocytes; and CD56 and CD16 for the identification of natural killer (NK) cells. The cytometry technique has revolutionized the way that the cells are identified, and over the years this platform has progressed with several advances in hardware and software that aim to improve workflow resulting in higher productivity, quality and cost savings. The Aquios CL – Beckman Coulter (BC) is an example of this advance because it is a complete automation instrument in flow cytometry called “Load & Go flow cytometer” for quantification of lymphocyte subpopulations in the routine diagnosis. In this study, the Aquios CL was validated, and quantification in frequency and absolute numbers of the lymphocyte subpopulations had an excellent correlation with the results obtained by the dual platform quantification performed in the Cytomics FC500 (BC) and automated Sysmex XE-2100 cell analyzer.Key words: Aquios CL; flow cytometry; subpopulation of lymphocytes; CD4/CD8. rESuMo A citometria de fluxo (CF) é uma ferramenta importante para diagnóstico, prognóstico e acompanhamento terapêutico de diversas neoplasias hematológicas. Além disso, possibilita a quantificação das subpopulações linfocitárias (SPL) para assistência diagnóstica e monitoramento das imunodeficiências primárias e adquiridas por meio das expressões antigênicas de CD19 e CD20 para linfócitos B; CD2, CD3, CD4 e CD8 para linfócitos T; e CD56 e CD16 para identificação de células natural killer (NK). A técnica de CF revolucionou a maneira como as células são identificadas e, ao longo dos anos, essa plataforma tem progredido com diversos avanços em hardware e software que visam melhorar o fluxo de trabalho, resultando em maior produtividade, qualidade e redução de custos. O Aquios CL – Beckman Coulter (BC) é um exemplo desse avanço, pois é um equipamento de automação completa em CF (denominado Load & Go flow cytometer) para quantificação de SPL na rotina diagnóstica.

Quantification of these populations helps monitor immunosuppressing and immunomodulatory therapies and the diagnosis and monitoring of primary immunodeficiencies, besides contributing to the lymphocytic populations(4-6). evaluation of post-transplant Moreover, quantification of CD4 T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Aids) is important to evaluate disease progression and response to treatment(7-9).The increased number of carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has provided a considerable advance in FC. The search for services equipped with the technology of CD4 T lymphocyte quantification has become more and more frequent, and the use of tools that add speed, efficacy and quality to diagnosis and to monitoring of immunodeficiencies has been made essential in clinical practice(8, 10).The FC practice revolutionized the way cells are characterized and identified and, over the years, this platform has progressed with several improvements in hardware and software that aim at enhancing work flow, resulting in higher productivity, quality, 379and cost reduction. However, FC is still a laborious technique that involves several technical steps of washing, labeling, acquisition, and sample analysis, what increases significantly error chances during the process(11).The Aquios CL instrument – Beckman Coulter (BC) is a complete automation tool in FC. It is identified as “Load & Go flow cytometer” for quantification of lymphocyte subpopulations in diagnostic routine, representing a real and significant improvement in the area of laboratory diagnosis(11, 12). This work was aimed at validating and comparing quantification in frequency and absolute numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations performed at Aquios CL with the result obtained by the double platform performed at Cytomics FC500 (BC) and in the Sysmex XE-2100 (Sysmex) automated cell analyzer. Besides, we will discuss the actual benefits of this instrument in diagnostic routine.MatEriaLS anD MEthoDSSamplesSeventy-two samples of peripheral blood were analyzed. CD3, CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte quantification was determined in all samples; quantification of CD19+ B lymphocytes and CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, in 28 of the 72 samples. These were collected in a tube containing the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and processed within 24 h after collection. The patients presented age median of 47 years (age group 1-99); 37 were males.Laiz C. Bento; Rodolfo P. Correia; Eduardo C. Pedro; Anderson M. Alexandre; Andressa C. Vaz; Daniela Schimidell; Rodrigo S. Barroso; Nydia S. BacalCytomics FC500 and Sysmex XE-2100Leukocyte count was done in the automated cell counter Sysmex XE-2100 by the impedance technique and optical reading. The leukocyte differential was automatically given by the counter and, when necessary, a blood smear was prepared for microscopic evaluation and accurate quantification of total lymphocytes.For the characterization and quantification of subpopulations of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes, the samples were labeled in a single tube with the monoclonal antibodies described in Table 1. In order to identify the population of NK cells and B lymphocytes, we used three labeled tubes with the monoclonal antibodies described in Tables 1 and 2. After labeling and incubation of 20 minutes, the lysis of red cells and fixation of leukocytes were performed by the automated no-wash Coulter TQ-Prep system (Beckman Coulter, SN: AV26068). Then, samples were acquired in the flow cytometer Cytomics FC500, and data analysis was performed in the software CXP Cytometer 2.2 and at Kaluza (Beckman Coulter).Aquios CLAquios CL is a flow cytometer, a single-platform system and automated cell counter that has the advantage of using impedance for absolute quantification of leukocytes, and not the conventional FC strategy by means of fluorescent particles (beads) of known concentration.For evaluation and quantification of CD3, CD3/CD and CD3/CD8 T lymphocytes subpopulations, the mix of monoclonal antibodies described in Table 3 was used, available in the ready-to-use format called Tetra Panel 1. In the analysis of populations of B lymphocytes and NK cells, the system uses the mix of monoclonal antibodies Tetra Panel 2, described in Table 4. The use of Tetra Panel 1 and 2 for complete quantification of T, B and NK subpopulations of lymphocytes is called Aquios Tetra Combo.In the Aquios CL, sample labeling was done in a 96-well microplate in an automated manner; red cell lysis, by means of the no-wash technique. Data analysis was carried out by the equipment itself using the gating automatic strategy. However, the software permits the user to make fine gate adjustment, when necessary.Statistical analysisThe results for each method were described with the use of mean and standard deviation (SD), and the agreement between the methods for each parameter was verified with the use of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The difference between the methods was estimated by calculating the repeatability for each parameter. The statistical analysis was performed with the software SPSS, version 22.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).rESuLtSThe comparison between the different platforms of lymphocyte quantification took into consideration results in frequency and absolute numbers and the final test interpretation.taBLE 1 − Monoclonal antibodies used for identification of CD3/CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte and B subpopulations at Cytomics FC500MarkersCloneFluorochromesFITCPEECDPC5CD3/CD4/CD8 Tlymphocyte subpopulation CD8CD4CD45CD3B lymphocytesubpopulationCD19CD2CD45CD3CD3/CD4/CD8 Tlymphocyte subpopulationSFCI21Thy2D3SFCI12T4D11J33UCHT1B lymphocytesubpopulation89BSFCI3Pt2H9J33UCHT1ManufacturerBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterFITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE: phycoerythrin; ECD: phycoerythrin-Texas Red-X.taBLE 2 − Monoclonal antibodies used for identification of NK lymphocyte subpopulations at Cytomics FC500taBLE 3 − Cocktail of monoclonal antibodies used for characterization of subpopulations of T lymphocytes in the Aquios CLFluorochromesFITCPEECDPC5MarkersCD3CD56/16CD45CD2CloneUCHT1N901/3G8J3339C1.5ManufacturerBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterFluorochromesFITCRD1ECDPC5Tetra 1 – PanelCD45CD4CD8CD3CloneB3821F4ASFCI12T4D11SFCI21Thy2D3UCHT1ManufacturerBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterFITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE: phycoerythrin; ECD: phycoerythrin-Texas Red-X.FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; ECD: phycoerythrin-Texas Red-X.380Aquios CL flow cytometer performance in the automated quantification of lymphocyte subpopulationstaBLE 4 − Cocktail of monoclonal antibodies used for characterization of subpopulations of B and NK lymphocytes in the Aquios CLFluorochromesFITCRD1ECDPC5Tetra 2 – PanelCD45CD16/CD56CD19CD3CloneB3821F4AN901/NKH-1, 3G8J3-119UCHT1ManufacturerBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterBeckman CoulterFITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; ECD: phycoerythrin-Texas Red-X.The analysis of 72 samples demonstrated statistically acceptable correlation between the panels used in the Aquios CL and the panel used in the Cytomics FC500.

Bacaldecrease in turnaround time (TAT) because it is an automated instrument.At a work recently published by Degandt et al. (2018)(4), the performance of Aquios CL in relation to double platform Sysmex XE-5000 and BD FACSCanto II was acceptable; however, around a third of the samples needed manual adjustment in the gate of lymphocytes. An advantage of the software of Aquios CL is the flagging system, which signals the need to review gate.The system “Load & Go flow cytometer” of Aquios provides sample preparation along with fluorescence analysis; it generates results of frequency and absolute numbers in a single instrument (single platform); has the possibility of interface of results with computerized systems in clinical laboratories(10, 11).Cost evaluation was not part of the scope of our study, but Aquios CL reagents are known to be more expensive than those used in conventional FC. However, if we take into account all the technical benefits already described for Aquios, principally the significant reduction of technical workforce due to complete automation, it is possible to ensure that this instrument generates economic viability important to clinical laboratories with great volume of samples.Automation in FC adds new perspectives for the technique and provides improvement in quality and productivity of the process, eliminating chances of error almost completely.By the automation of CD4 cells process of quantification, it is possible not to depend on formation and expertise of the technical staff, making the process more simplified and independent from specialized workforce, but the interpretation and levels of review continue to be fundamental in the post-analytical process to trigger a flag in the clinical area.ConCLuSionThe instrument Aquios C presented excellent performance in the quantification of lymphocyte subpopulations. Because it is an instrument with complete automation, it promoted standardization, quality, and reduction in the time of technical procedure, becoming an adequate and viable tool in clinical laboratories with a high sampling flow.FigurE 3 − Gating strategy used in the FC500 cytometer and Kaluza analysis softwareA) selection of the viable population by means of side scatter × forward scatter; B) side scatter × CD45 with gate in the region of total lymphocytes; C, D, E) inside the gate of lymphocytes, we identified populations of T, B, and NK lymphocytes; F, G, H) still inside the gate of lymphocytes, we identified a population of CD3 T lymphocytes and the CD4 and CD8 subpopulations.DiSCuSSionThe enhancement in the work flow of FC is a real necessity in clinical laboratories that search to improve productivity, quality and cost reduction. The Aquios CL instrument meets this demand, because it brings improvement in technical standardization; reduces pre-analytical errors; avoid sample changes, as all pipetting is automated and reagents/samples are monitored with bar codes; improves workers training; eliminates subjectivity from analysis; monitors quality control; reduces result releasing time. Besides, as it is a closed system, the equipment provides the operator a safe manipulation of the sample, avoiding biological contamination.Our results demonstrate statistical significance to compare quantification of lymphocyte subpopulations between Aquios CL and Cytomics FC500, what corroborates data already published. Gossez et al. (2011)(11) showed that Aquios CL obtained good correlation in the quantification of CD4 T lymphocytes when compared with FC500. Besides, it can be used in the diagnostic routine and also in proficiency tests.Grossi et al. (2018)(12) demonstrated good correlation between Aquios CL and the bead-based assay of the equipment BD FACSCanto II. That study also demonstrates an important 382Aquios CL flow cytometer performance in the automated quantification of lymphocyte subpopulationsrEFErEnCES1. Sales MM, Vasconcelos DM.
