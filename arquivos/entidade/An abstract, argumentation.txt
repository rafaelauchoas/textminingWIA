The framework can be understood as a generalisation of Theorist. The generalisation allows any theory formulated in a monotonic logic to be extended by a defeasible set of assumptions. logic, non-monotonic modal autoe~is~mic An assumption can be defeated (or “attacked”) if its “contrary” can be proved, possibly with the aid of other conflicting assumptions. We show that, given such a framework, the standard semantics of most logics for default reasoning can be understood as sanctioning a set of assumptions, as an (in the sense that extension of a given theory, if and only if the set of assumptions it does not attack itself) and it attacks every assumption not in the set. is conflict-free We propose a more liberal, argumentation-theoretic semantics, based upon the notion of admis- sible extension in logic programming. We regard a set of assumptions, in general, as admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and defends itself (by attacking) every set of assumptions which at- tacks it. We identify conditions for the existence of extensions and for the equivalence of different semantics. (EJ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction formal Until recently, logic was concerned mainly with the fo~alisation of universal “truths”, such as those of mathematics, which hold without exception and for all time. in the sense The logics which have proved useful if new that any logical consequence that certain axioms are added. Because of the default character of human beliefs hold by default to apply reasoning have met with limited of human logics such monotonic success. For this reason a number of’ “non-monotonic” have been developed. if there is no reason to the formalisation for this purpose are all monotonic, remains a logical consequence the contrary, attempts of a set of axioms Iogics 13%40,491 to believe reasoning, framework, In this paper, we show that many of these logics can be understood based upon an argumentation-theoretic of a single abstract of the semantics of logic programming this framework, logic, regarded as an acceptable extension of a given theory, unless and until there is reason believe some contrary set of assumptions. Non-monotonicity of a new sentence acceptable default conclusion, which now has to be withdrawn. the addition to the contrary of a previously [ 6, 10, I 1, ‘271.

In general, there is no proof that he is guilty. In particular, case where there is insufficient evidence to prove either is guilty or that he is not, the default principle gives the accused that he is innocent. In contrast, the representation the this in that the benefit in classical A.

The notion of acceptable extension can be understood several different ways. in A se~n~ntics for default reasoning is given by specifying the notion of acceptable extension and identifying whether the approach is credulous or sceptical. The simplest notion of acceptability, which in its credulous manifestation we call the theory be extended with some maximal is ca~~~ct-f~ee (in the sense that the contrary of none of the requires simply that the initial in the set can be shown using logic). This semantics generalises the notion of consequence the semantics of Theorist in the underlying [ 431, in which The second, logic is classical, credulous semantics first-order logic. generalises the stable model semantics and the standard semantics of default logic, autoepistemic logic.

Viewed in such ~gumentation-theoretic terms, stable semantics is unnecessarily taking a stand on every issue (i.e. every possible assumption ionated, stable set or is attacked by it), whether or not that issue is relevant under consideration.

I;ogic programming Given a normal logic program P, let (P, AD, -) be the corresponding assumption-based framework (as defined in Section 2.2).

Note that the condition that AE is closed is unnecessary, because every set of assumptions in such an assumption-based framework is closed. Theorem 3.13 below states that stable semantics for logic programing corresponds to stable model semantics [ 201, defined in terms of Herbrand models. A Herbrand interpretation I of a theory is any subset of the Herbrand base of the language of the theory. It assigns the truth value true to any ground atom in I and the truth value false to any ground atom not in I. The truth value of any other sentence is 80 A.

Let A’ be an arbitrary attack against A. Since A does not attack itself, it is clear that A’ g A. Hence, A’ - A is not empty. Since A is stable, A attacks A’ - A. Therefore A attacks A’. So A is admissible. Since A attacks every assumption to it, it is clear that A is a maximal admissible set of assumptions. Hence A is preferred. not belonging Example 4.1 shows that not every preferred set of assumptions is stable. 0 In general, maximal conflict-free by Example 2.6, where the only preferred set of assumptions preferred sets of assumptions following example. sets of assumptions need not be preferred, as shown is {not guilty}.

Since (T, Ab, -) is flat, A’ is closed. First we prove that A’ attacks it. In fact, each attack against A’ is either an attack against A, which every attack against or an attack against S, again attacked by A is attacked by A (since A is admissible), that A’ does not attack itself. In fact, if A’ did (since A defends attack itself, then A’ would attack either A or S. In the first case, since A is admissible, A attacks A’ and therefore S. Since A defends S, we have that A attacks of assumptions, which A’ - A = S - A.

Existence, coincidence and uniqueness of semantics In this section, we investigate two classes of flat assumption-based frameworks, frameworks.

Thus, always exist, for stratified assump- coincide, tion-based to exist frameworks, preferred and by Corollary 4.11, is also stable. Thus, for order-consistent stable semantics and are unique.
