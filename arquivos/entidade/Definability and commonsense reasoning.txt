Abstract 

in  commonsense 

is  a  central  problem 

The  definition  of  concepts 

in 
reasoning  concern  implicit  and  explicit  definability.  Implicit  definability  in  non- 
nonmonotonic 
monotonic  logic  is  always  relative  to  the  context-the 
current  theory  of  the  world.  We  show  that 
fixed  point  equations  provide  a  generalization  of  explicit  definability,  which  correctly  captures  the 
relativized  context.  Theories  expressed  within  this  logical  framework  provide  implicit  definitions 
of  concepts.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  to derive  these  fixed points  entirely  within  the  logic.  @  1997
