This work represents an analysis of secondarydata collected from a project database entitled “Family Aggre-gation of Breast Cancer in São Luís-Maranhão”, integratedwith the Program of Practices of Completeness and Health(PROPIS)/PROEX/UFMA, which supported the development ofthis scientific research.The study was conducted by interviewing using a question-naire, in a sample consisting of 107 women (between 17 and75 years), healthy, some with clinical signs of climacteric (neu-rovegetative, neuropsychiatric or genital), in which risk factorsrelated to osteoporosis were observed.The selection of these patients occurred by spontaneousdemand among people assisted by the Program of Practices ofCompleteness and Health (PROPIS) of the Federal Universityof Maranhão (UFMA).The criterion for the inclusion of patients in the study waswomen living in São Luís-MA assisted by the program and thecriterion used for non-inclusion was women who do not livein São Luís-MA but had been assisted by PROPIS/UFMA.Women who met  the inclusion criteria were informedabout the research and, after consenting to take part in it,signed the Free Informed Consent previously approved by theEthics Committee of the University Hospital of the FederalUniversity of Maranhão (UFMA) under the opinion no. 362/07.Data were tabulated and analyzed in the epidemiologicalEpi-Info® software, version 3.4.1. To investigate the associa-tion among variables, the ratio of proportions was used. Incontinuous variables, the ANOVA test was used and the resultswere expressed as means and standard deviation. The resultswere expressed with whole numbers and percentages. Thevariables that were considered significant presented value ofp < 0.05.ResultsThe analysis of socioeconomic and demographic profiles ofthe groups with and without menopause showed no sig-nificant difference. The groups were homogeneous, with apredominance of brown skin color, consensual relationshipproved to be a protective factor and the average monthlyincome was of 2–3 minimum wages  (Table 1).The low level of education proved to be a risk factor;most patients lived in brick houses, whose water supply wasConsidering average age, the people of the group withmenopause had 54.1 years and without menopause had 31.3years as average, proving it to be a significant datum, withp < 0.0001 (Table 1).sample’s Regarding characteristics,menarche in the group with menopause was 13.6 years and13.2 years in the group without menopause, a difference notstatistically significant (Table 2).premenopausal The average age of menopause the group withmenopause was 43.7 years, and the majority (62.5%) occurrednaturally and without hormone replacement therapy (93.8%).As to menstrual cycle, the irregular type proved to be a pro-tective factor (Table 2).in In both study groups, with and without menopause, familyhistory of osteoporosis was not a significant factor. The major-ity had a negative family history of osteoporosis (Table 2).Considering gestational sample characterization, the aver-age number of pregnancies was 4.56 for the group withmenopause and 2.45 for the group without menopause, andmost births occurred naturally. This is a significant datum,with p < 0.0001 (Table 3).The analysis of lifestyle and nutritional status of the sam-ple showed that smoking, lack of physical exercise and intakeof caffeine are risk factors for osteoporosis, while the absenceof alcohol abuse, as well as the intake of soft drinks and cannedfood are protective factors for the disease (Table 4).DiscussionAccording to epidemiological data of Europe Union memberstates, there will be changes in age structure, with a moreacute concentration in the group with 80 years or more.  Inthis group, there will be a higher incidence of osteoporoticfractures. This population group will increase from 8.9 millionwomen and 4.5 million men  in 1995 to 26.4 million women and17.4 million men  in 2050.14Literature data state that osteoporosis is a bone-metabolicdisease that especially affects women after menopause.According to the World Health Organization, one-third ofwhite women above the age of 65 have osteoporosis.15In Brazil, it is noticed that there are few studies in theliterature that analyze the epidemiology profile of osteoporo-sis. A study conducted in Recife by Bandeira et al. 6, with asample of 627 women, found an average age of 63.9 yearsand a menopause period of 16.2 years. Martini et al. 16,analyzing premenopausal women, found a prevalence of 6%of osteoporosis and 33% of postmenopausal women. Clarket al. 4 found a prevalence of 33.8% of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. The prevalence of osteoporosis is higherin women with a family income lower than 10 minimumwages.17In this study, the prevalence of osteoporosis was 40%, a sim-ilar result to the data of a study with 600 patients evaluatedin Detroit, USA, in which a prevalence of osteoporosis of 52%was observed.17 This shows that the problem of osteoporo-sis assumes the same importance in our country, with a highprevalence, and therefore there is the need for more  data on        114 revbrasreumatol. 2 0 1 6;5 6(2):111–116Table 1 – Socioeconomic and demographic characterization of the sample.

In Asian countries, the preva-lence was 39.1%, also similar to that found in this study.18,19As to skin color, most studies have reported that the preva-lence of osteoporosis and fracture incidence varies accordingto gender and race. White women after menopause have ahigher incidence of fractures.1,8,15 However, a study conductedin Baltimore, USA, found a prevalence of 22% of osteoporosisin African-Americans, a value higher than expected for thispopulation.20In relation to marital status, this study found a higherprevalence of women in stable relationships. Most of thepatients had low education and its direct relation to the preva-lence of osteoporosis was not defined in papers. The reasonprobably is the effect of education on lifestyle, nutrition andeconomic status.21The influence of hypoestrogenism in the developmentis well documented. Thus, studies showof osteoporosis that early menopause and delayed menarche have a dele-terious effect on the development of this disease, leadingto decreased bone mass in early life, when bone mineralcontent would be expected to be increased or stabilized.This early loss, if sustained for future years and not diag-nosed and treated, may lead to osteoporosis and thenfractures, which wouldto an increase of add greater morbidity and mortality the underlyingdisease.22,23the risk of to This study showed that the presence of irregular men-strual cycles is a protective factor for osteoporosis, fact thatfinds no correlation in the literature.

This showsthat osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease with an increas-ing prevalence. It has a great importance to public health andstudies with a larger sample are necessary so that more  sig-nificant comparisons are made.Conflicts  of  interestThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgementsTo the Program of Practices of Completeness and Health ofthe Federal University of Maranhão – PROPIS/UFMA for theirsupport and partnership necessary for the implementation ofthis project.r eferences1.
