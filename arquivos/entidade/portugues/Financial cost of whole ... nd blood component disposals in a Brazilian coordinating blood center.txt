To ensure the safety of the recipients, the World Health Organization recommends that all stages of the blood cycle, from donor uptake to transfusion, be co-ordinated by integrated blood supply networks(1).In Brazil, the regulation, supervision and control of blood products and services are performed by the Na-tional Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária - ANVISA) according to the Min-istry of Health. The hemotherapy services integrate, in federal instance, the national blood network, composed in each state of the federation by a coordinating blood center, regional blood centers, blood nucleus and col-lection and transfusion units. The coordinating blood center, of a public nature, has a central role and should be a reference service for the respective state in the area of hemotherapy and/or hematology. The regional blood center has macroregional activity while the hemothera-py nucleus acts in the respective microregion. Collection and transfusion units have lower care complexity(2). Thus, it is observed that Brazil has an organized system in which each state of the federation is responsible for the collec-tion, processing and distribution network. As such, each coordinating blood center needs to improve its processes to meet the blood needs of the hospitals it serves.This organization, recommended by the country’s Blood and Blood Products Policy, is meeting the grow-ing number of blood samples in the world. Brazil follows this expansion and presented, in 2014, an increase of 162,446 blood collection procedures in relation to the previous year; in the country, donations are characterized as voluntary and altruistic(3-4). Considering this type of blood donation and the financial values of its processing, rational use is desired, observing the necessary and legal steps of safe use.Blood transfusion, like any therapeutic practice, has its risks. Among the strategies for reducing diseases, clinical screening represents a primordial stage, considering the information reported by the donor candidate regarding the advancing and current state of health and life habits. And certain situations or behaviors, such as alcohol con-sumption and illicit drugs that signal additional risk for sexually transmitted infections, impact on the results of the serological screening step(5).2 Rev Gaúcha Enferm. 2019;40:e20190033In Brazil, blood centers provide blood and blood com-ponents to health services and are reimbursed by the state based on the Unified Health System’s financial ta-ble, last updated in 2006(6). For example, when providing a unit of whole blood, the blood center receives R$ 285 or US$ 75.81.Given the goal of risk-free blood use, regulatory bod-ies intend to minimize transfusion incidents, ensure safe transfusions, and determine whether or not to use col-lected blood. In this context, blood or blood component disposal should be performed whenever the product is considered inappropriate for use due to factors interfer-ing with blood cycle safety and related to collection con-ditions, risk behavior or reactive serology, failure of stor-age or transport and expiration of product(5).In the disposal, besides the technical aspects, the fi-nancial value must be considered. According to an esti-mate made by the World Health Organization, only the disposal of packed red blood cells in Latin American and Caribbean countries in 2011 represented a loss of ap-proximately US$ 45 million, with a corresponding cost of US$ 20 million US dollars to the Brazilian state (7). This sce-nario prompts the need to know the factors that influence the disposal of processed blood units, in order to list ac-tions to prevent those considered potentially avoidable.In the southern region of Brazil, the state of Paraná stands out in the absolute number of collections, spe-cifically in production with an increase of approximately 20% between 2012 and 2015(3,8). Therefore, the existence of productive growth and financial impact is well known; however, Paraná leads in number of cases of unfit donors among other states in the region(3).Considering the economic impact and social reper-cussion of blood collection, processing and use in health services, with a view to subsidizing actions to minimize waste, contribute to the growth of blood supply and re-duce the financial impact on the public sector, we have the following as research question: “What are the reasons for blood disposal in the coordinating blood center of Paraná and the financial cost of potentially avoidable dis-charges?” And the objectives are to describe the reasons for blood disposal in the coordinating blood center of the state of Paraná and to estimate the financial costs result-ing from potentially avoidable discharges.1 Considering the value of the commercial US dollar against the real on January 27, 2019 (R$ 3.76), according to the website https://www.dolarhoje.net.br.Financial cost of whole blood and blood component disposals in a Brazilian coordinating blood center MATERIAL AND METHODSIt is a descriptive research, with a retrospective quan-titative approach and documentary analysis. Data col-lection took place between January and May 2017 and was developed from secondary databases related to the disposal of blood components of the coordinating blood center of Paraná, located in the state’s capital. The cen-ter is responsible for the collection, storage, processing, transfusion and distribution of blood to 384 public, pri-vate and philanthropic hospitals in the state(9).The study included all reported cases of whole blood and blood component disposal occurring from Janu-ary 2010 to December 2015 and recorded in the Hemovi-da System. The temporal cutoff is justified due to the use of data from the referred System, which was developed and implemented specifically for blood banks, and was effective until 2015(10). Data were used from technical reports were used complementarily; and inconsistent data due to possible typing errors and/or inadequate re-cords were excluded after analysis and consensus among the researchers.The variables analyzed were the quantity of bags pro-duced and discarded of packed red blood cells, platelet concentrate, cryoprecipitate, common plasma, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate-free plasma, and whole blood. Disposal reasons were also analyzed, and these were classified as potentially avoidable and non-avoid-able by a committee of three specialists with over 20 years of experience in the areas of Hematology and Hemotherapy. Data recorded in the “other reasons” field of the Hemovida System were classified as unavoidable because the causes could not be known.To estimate the financial costs of disposals, the amounts paid, in reimbursement, to health services relat-ed to blood components were used, as shown in Chart 1, in force in the year of the information document and esti-mated in dollar ($) value in the current period(6).Blood components or ProceduresReference valueReal (R$)Dollar (US$)1Operational costs* of whole bloodRBC concentrate operating costsOperating costs of random platelet concentrateOperating costs of fresh frozen plasmaCryoprecipitate operating costs285.00150.00135.00125.00100.0073.8338.8634.9732.3825.91Chart 1 - Reference value for reimbursement to hemotherapy services provided to the Unified Health System and private health institutions in Brazil in 2006.

These data are similar to the results of blood production in Brazil in 2014, with 8,324,711 units, including public and private services, of which 33.6% re-ferred to red cell concentrate production (n=2,799,759) fol-lowed by fresh frozen plasma with 28.9% (n=2,408,135)(12). Red blood cell concentrate is known to be used in clinical practice to treat or prevent imminent and inadequate re-lease of oxygen to tissues, such as acute hemorrhage and normovolemic anemia; and is usually requested in emer-gency situations, justifying more frequent use and the need for greater production by Brazilian blood centers(4).Federal government data show that among the blood component units produced in Brazil in 2014, more than 2.5 million were discarded, representing 31.8% of pro-duction(12), higher than the findings of the present study regarding general disposal (22.3%) and ranging from 6.6% (platelet concentrate) to 80.2% (common plasma). According to the report on data from Brazilian blood production, the most commonly discarded blood com-ponent, in relation to production, was common plasma, representing 67.9% and 81.6% of cases for 2014 and 2015, respectively(12), consistent with the disposal identified in the present research.When absolute numbers are observed, fresh frozen plasma is discarded, with 53,927 units (53%) similar to na-tional data, when more than one million bags were discard-ed(12). A study conducted at a blood bank in Iran showed that plasma bag discharges over the two-year period (2010 to 2012) were 93.9% of the total bags produced (n=37,129). The study pointed out that puncturing of pouches due to technical failures during processing was the main reason for the disposal of fresh frozen plasma(13).The high index of this blood component may also be related to the lower frequency in the indication of plasma for transfusion, when compared to the packed red blood cells. To be accepted for the industrial production of blood products, the excess volume of fresh frozen plasma, com-mon plasma and cryoprecipitate free plasma must be equal to or greater than 150 ml, presence of the collection tube attached to the pouch, integrity of the pouch/collect-ing tube, absence of red blood cells in the bag/collecting tube, non-lipemic, erythromic or green appearance, uni-formity and horizontal freezing. That is, plasma pouches with inadequate quality parameters, in addition to not be-ing suitable for transfusion, often cannot be used for the industrial production of blood products and, therefore, are discarded(14).Regarding the various reasons for disposal, the analysis allowed to estimate the avoidability potential. Lipemia was the most frequent discard reason, with limited avoidabil-ity potential. This condition results in a milky appearance of plasma and is a cause for non-compliance in the pro-duction process(15). However, although visual inspection of Rev Gaúcha Enferm. 2019;40:e201900337 Covo MZ, Cruz EDA, Maurício AB, Batista J, Souza LALplasma bags is, in practice, an indicator for disposal, meth-ods for assessing the effectiveness of visual testing are not known, requiring the need for the periodic training of pro-fessionals to meet the technical specifications described in Brazilian legislation(5,16). It is noteworthy that, in addition to the technical preparation of the professional, it is recom-mended that the donor eats adequately prior to donation in order to reduce cases of dyslipidemia and subsequent disposal of processed units(17).Red blood cell contamination was the second most frequent cause of discard (17.5%; n=10,147). A study in an Indian blood bank found that red blood cell contamination in platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma represent-ed less than 0.1% of total discards(17), unlike the findings in the present research. Contamination is related to greater adhesion of red blood cells to the inner walls of the blood bag due to the plastic material used to make them; to avoid the formation of lumps and red blood cell contami-nation, active homogenization of the post-collection bag is recommended, an essential maneuver in which employees should be trained(13,17).Reagent serology, the third potentially preventable cause of disposal (16.7%; n=9,672), demonstrates donors’ lack of knowledge about their current health condition. In 2015, in the state of Paraná, the most frequent reagent serologies were Anti-HBc (Hepatitis B marker), with 1.5%, followed by Syphilis (0.8%)(12). That same year, positive RBC concentrate serology in Latin American (38%) and Caribbe-an (55%) countries was the reason that exceeded discard of bags due to expiration date, a factor prevalent among platelet concentrate units(7). Despite these findings, it is necessary to stimulate the donor’s prior testing of infec-tious diseases, as well as to convey information in the main media about conscious donation. Strict adherence to crite-ria for donor selection, counseling and the use of software to identify positive donors for reactive serology are iden-tified among the strategies to minimize blood disposal(17).Although considered a potentially avoidable reason for disposal, out-of-parameter volume implicitly brings a cause of difficult prevention, as it results from blood pro-cessing. In this research this reason corresponded to the disposal of 4,970 units (8.6%), and could be minimized by preventive calibration of the equipment as well as by measures of hydration, feeding and rest of the donor in the pre-procedure period, reducing incomplete donations caused by vasovagal reaction(17). However, it is noteworthy that even the collection of a volume within the parameters can generate insufficient volume of the byproducts, with consequent discard.8 Rev Gaúcha Enferm. 2019;40:e20190033Expiration, with or without serology performed, rep-resented 7% (n=4,086) of the discards with potential for reduction. In 2015, in Latin America, red blood cell and platelet concentrate disposal was also frequently associat-ed with expiration of units (37% and 58%, respectively)(7). This reason for disposal is considered preventable and can be reduced by distributing them among the services that make up the state hemo network.The amount of blood components to be collected and produced must maintain a balance, based on reliable forecasting, to meet requests. However, production above demand contributes to disposal. It is noted that shelf life is dependent on blood product and storage conditions and ranges from five days (platelet concentrate) to two years (plasma products)(4). A research conducted in a blood bank in India found that among 4,026 discarded blood compo-nents, the highest prevalence was platelet concentrate (47.7%), and the main reason (96.6%) was expiration due to non-use(18). Thus, the need is reiterated to identify whether or not the discard due to expiration is a a consequence of excess production or not. And, in this case, also the need to balance inventory with demand.In the present research, it was found that the reasons for disposal related to donor registration and identification, transportation, storage and thawing, accounted for 3.5% of the cases (n=2,040), with the possibility of reducing its occurrence. Examples include the elaboration and periodic updating of Standard Operating Procedures, supervision and validation of processes, as well as educational activities for those involved in each stage of the blood cycle. These interventions were positive for reducing blood waste in a transfusion center located in West Asia. Cost savings were estimated at US$ 1,500,000(13).According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, red blood cell concentrates without an additive solution should have a hematocrit between 65% and 80% and, in cases of bags with an additive solution, this may vary from 50 to 70%(5). In this research, it was observed that disposals due to hematocrit below the recommended parameters repre-sented a lower frequency among potentially preventable causes, which highlights the importance of semi-automat-ed procedures to avoid the waste of processed red cell concentrate bags.A study conducted in India regarding the causes of 615 blood bags discarded showed that abnormal plasma staining and hemolysis accounted for 1.3% (n=8)(18), lower than what was found in this research (23.9%; n=10,486), in-dicating the possibility of improving processing. The use of blood components for quality control accounted for 19.9% (n=8,726) of discarded units. This destination is regulated Financial cost of whole blood and blood component disposals in a Brazilian coordinating blood centerby the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and is an important step in the safe use of blood(5).Although blood processing is performed by profes-sionals only, it is possible that some technical errors lead to nonconformities and consequent product disposal. As an example, discard by swirling <2+, visual inspection criteri-on for quality control of platelet concentrate, is cited. Con-sidering the subjective aspect of this evaluation and the frequency of discards for this reason, the need for technical training and continuing education of the team is inferred in order to minimize errors.Reported as “other reasons”, 10,804 units (24.6%) of blood were discarded, resulting from the fact that the Hemovida System presents this field, without being linked to the details of the cause. Thus, it was not possible to know what these reasons were, which is considered as a limitation of the research because it often surpasses several of the nominally informed causes.As for the financial costs of potentially avoidable whole blood and blood component disposals, it has been estimated at approximately R$ 760 million, equivalent to approximate-ly US$ 2 million, if we consider that only one unit of packed red blood cells costs, with underestimated values, R$ 150 or US$ 39.9. An Indian study found that in a large blood bank, the disposal of 6,777 units of whole blood and red blood cells (2012-2016) by expiration alone accounted for approximately US$ 100,000, considering a unit value of US$ 15(19).The cost involved in managing the use of blood com-ponents results in the generation of health waste, a ma-jor environmental and public health problem, adding even more cost to the production of blood components, as some states hire companies to dispose of its biological waste. A Brazilian study conducted with data from inspec-tions in hemotherapy services in 2013 indicated important compliance to be observed in the blood cycle. Among these, it highlighted protocols for the control of indications and disposal of blood components, as well as compatible areas for waste disposal(20).The high rate of disposal reiterates the need to control the main reasons for even reducing the waste of financial resources also due to waste treatment. These add cost to their disposal, in addition to the expenses with materials and procedures used in the collection, processing and other stages of the blood cycle. The starting point was the assumption that in view of the disposal of blood compo-nents for potentially preventable causes, the coordinating blood center of the State of Paraná stopped supplying these products and, therefore, was not reimbursed; al-though there were financial expenses. Thus, it is necessary to intensify measures to reduce the various reasons relat-ed to the disposal of blood bags. These should be in line with the strategies outlined in the action plan (2014/2019) for universal access to safe blood in Latin American and Caribbean countries(7). CONCLUSIONIt was concluded that the disposal of blood and blood components occurred mainly for potentially preventable causes, such as lipemia, red blood cell contamination and reagent serology, generating an approximate cost of US$ 2 million for the public service. The results show the potential for the avoidability of discards and of financial waste. The results are expected to be an important input to improve actions to reduce disposal through planned and coordinated actions such as process and logistics review, in-service training and continuing education of technical staff. The establishment of a quality management commit-tee, focusing on the technical and operational causes asso-ciated with disposal, may contribute to its avoidability; as well as the wide dissemination to the population of criteria for blood donation and impediments related to lipemia and positive serology. Recognizing blood as a product of extreme importance in clinical practice, the reduction of avoidable discards will contribute to the precise man-agement of the patient who needs it, by promoting and managing the stocks in blood centers, hemonuclei and hospital units.This study may instigate teaching units in technical and university education, and consequent research stud-ies aimed at recognizing the problem, and possible actions for continuous improvement in the various stages of the blood cycle, with direct impact on costs. Although the ref-erence table in force for the estimated costs is from 2006, with consequent mismatch in the described base values, the conversion of the values to US dollars allowed the pres-ent financial values to be more current.Noteworthy among the study limits are failures in re-cords, inconsistencies and underreporting in the database. The lack of national and international studies addressing the financial costs of blood and blood component discards demonstrates a knowledge gap that has hindered great-er theoretical support and comparison between services and countries. It is suggested that research focusing on this theme be conducted to highlight the need for actions to better use the donated product and the public resources. REFERENCES1.
