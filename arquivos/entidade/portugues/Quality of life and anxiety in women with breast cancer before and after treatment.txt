Method: prospective study. Breast cancer statistics (n=339, confidence=95%, accuracy= ± 5.32%). The quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) used were QLQ C-30 and QLQ Br23, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for anxiety. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with baseline quality of life and anxiety as well as pre- and post-treatment differences. Authorization was obtained from the Ethics Committee, and informed consent was provided by all patients. Results: the baseline quality of life dimensions with the lowest score were future prospects (46.0/100) and sexual enjoyment (55.7/100). The dimensions with the highest score were body image (94.2/100) and role (93.3/100). The most disturbing symptoms were insomnia, fatigue and concern about hair loss. After treatment, the dimensions of physical function, role, body image, financial concerns and symptomatology worsened, whereas emotional function and future prospects improved. Severe anxiety presented as a state (48.6%) and as a trait (18.2%). The highest baseline state anxiety was associated with married-widowed status and anxiolytic medication. The greatest trait anxiety was associated with an inactive work situation, anxiolytic medication, breast swelling and advanced stage at diagnosis. After treatment, anxiety significantly decreased. Conclusions: After treatment, the quality of life score was positively modified, while state and trait anxiety decreased.Descriptors: Quality of Life; Women; Breast Neoplasms; Anxiety; Nurses; Nursing Care Management.1 Doctoral student, Universidad de A Coruña, A Coruña, A Coruña, Spain.

We collected all cases with a histopathological diagnosis of breast cancer that The utility of quality of life measurements in daily presented from December 2013 to February 2015. clinical practice is widely referenced in the literature. In Male patients and those who underwent surgery and a systematic review published in 2010(1), it was shown follow-up at another centre were excluded. Patients that quality of life data influenced decision making in were identified at diagnosis through the results of 30.1% of medical interventions and in 63.2% of non-the histopathological findings. They were contacted biomedical interventions. Therefore, treatment plans during a visit to the breast cancer unit. The nurse of can be altered for or be contingent upon the quality of the unit invited those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria life of the patient. to participate. Two measures of quality of life and According to the literature, almost 50% of cancer anxiety were obtained, the first after the diagnosis and patients suffer from psychiatric disorders, and anxiety the second after the end of the chemotherapy and/or and depression are generally considered to be the most radiotherapy treatment.

Several studies have shown associations between From each patient, we analysed the sociodemographic anxiety and certain sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, previous comorbidities using the variables (age at diagnosis(3), civil status(4), level of Charlson comorbidity index(11), gynaecological and education(5), history of comorbidity(4) or history of prior obstetric history, family history of cancer, clinical treatment for anxiety and/or depression(6)).manifestations, stage, pathological type and type of One study on the impact of anxiety(7) related high therapeutic management.

The QLQ C-30 consists of 30 the patient.questions, with a Likert-type response (1 to 7 for the Given the close relationship between the nurse and overall health status and 1 to 4 for all other items). patient, nursing professionals are in a position to make This questionnaire evaluates overall health status, five an overall assessment of patients, as they attend to not functional scales (physical, emotional, role, cognitive only their physiological or clinical needs but also their and social) and the presented symptoms.psychological and social needs.Several randomized clinical trials have indicated psychological benefits following interventions performed by nurses. These include stress reduction(8), decreased anxiety, depression and improvement in physical and emotional well-being(9). Another study showed significant improvements in insomnia, dyspnoea and financial concerns(10). This study performed by the nursing staff of our breast cancer unit aims to determine the level of quality of life and anxiety as a state and as a trait in women diagnosed with breast cancer before and after treatment. This study also attempts to determine the variables associated with baseline quality of life and anxiety.MethodThe QLQ Br23 questionnaire consists of 23 items. It measures four functional scales (body image, future prospects, sexual function and sexual enjoyment) and symptoms (of the affected breast and arm, concern about hair loss and adverse effects of systemic therapies), with a Likert-type response (from 1 to 4). The system of measurement of both quality of life questionnaires presents a score of 0 to 100. Regarding these functional scales, the higher the score, the better the quality of life; regarding the scales for the assessment of symptoms, the higher the score, the worse the symptomatology.The questionnaire that was used to measure anxiety as a state and as a trait was the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)(14). This questionnaire comprises two separate scales of 20 items each for the measurement of anxiety as a state and as a trait, with a Likert-type response (0 to 3). Scores range from 0 to 60 points, This is an observational study in which patients with higher scores indicating higher anxiety.were prospectively followed-up and that was performed Justification of the sample size: 339 patients were at the Breast Cancer Unit of the University Hospital included in the analysis of the general characteristics, www.eerp.usp.br/rlae2Rev.

The evidence provided by the results of a prospective investigation after five years of follow-up after breast surgery(27) states that most positive changes in quality of life occur between one and two years after treatments. This study reveals that the health problems most In a study that measured the long-term quality of life commonly identified at the time of diagnosis involve in breast cancer survivors(18), it was observed that five the psychological field, as they affect the dimensions years after diagnosis, the GHS is not affected by the that are related to emotional functionality, future severity of the disease and/or the treatments received, perspectives, insomnia, anxiety and sexual enjoyment. which indicates that the quality of life at five years These results are in agreement with the results of similar seems to be affected by the same factors that affect the studies(15-16) and with the EORTC reference values  for the general population (generally age and comorbidities)(20). questionnaires used(17).
