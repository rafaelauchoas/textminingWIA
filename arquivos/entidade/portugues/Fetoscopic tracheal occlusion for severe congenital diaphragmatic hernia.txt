However,problems  of  open  surgery,  such  as  preterm  labor  and  prema-ture  rupture  of  membranes,  are  obstacles  to  the  success  ofthis  procedure  and  resulted  in  the  development  of  minimallyinvasive  techniques  performed  by  fetoscopy.5---9The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  present  the  initial  experi-ence  and  viability  of  fetoscopic  tracheal  occlusion  (FETO)and  anesthetic  experience  in  pregnant  women  whose  fetuseshad  severe  diaphragmatic  hernia.Retrospective  descriptive  study  performed  at  the  Hospitalda  Mulher  Professor  Doutor  José  Aristodemo  Pinotti  (CAISM---  Unicamp).  After  approval  by  the  institutional  Ethics  Com-mittee,  data  collection  was  based  on  review  of  anestheticand  obstetric  records.  The  waiver  of  informed  consent  wasrequested  from  the  aforementioned  committee  (Code  ofMedical  Ethics  ---  Resolution  196).  From  May  2007  to  May2012,  pregnant  women  whose  fetuses  presented  with  con-genital  diaphragmatic  hernia  (CDH)  were  included  in  thestudy.  The  procedure  performed  was  the  temporary  feto-scopic  tracheal  occlusion  (FETO)  with  inflatable  balloon,  andthe  inclusion  criteria  for  the  procedure  indication  were:fetuses  with  severe  diaphragmatic  hernia  characterized  byliver  herniation  into  the  chest,  lung-to-head  ratio  (LHR  <  1);gestational  age  less  than  27  completed  weeks  at  the  timeof  the  diagnosis  confirmation;  no  other  major  fetal  struc-tural  anomalies  (requiring  postnatal  surgical  repair);  andabsence  of  fetal  chromosomal  abnormalities  incompatibleFetoscopic  tracheal  occlusion  for  severe  congenital  diaphragmatic  hernia 333with  prolonged  postnatal  survival,  detected  by  conventionalkaryotype  analysis.Determination  of  liver  herniation  into  the  chest  was  per-formed  by  identifying  the  liver  parenchyma  and  vessels  intothe  chest  with  ultrasound  guidance  (color  Doppler).  Thelung-to-head  ratio  (LHR)  was  initially  achieved  with  an  ultra-sound  transverse  cross-section  of  the  fetal  chest  at  the  levelof  the  cardiac  four-chamber.  In  this  image,  the  lung  areacontralateral  to  the  CDH  was  drawn  manually  (dotted  linemethod)  and  expressed  in  mm2.  This  area  was  divided  bymeasuring  the  head  circumference  (expressed  in  mm)  incross-section  of  the  fetal  head.10,11Demographic  (age,  weight,  physical  status)  and  obstet-rical  (gestational  age  at  the  time  of  tracheal  occlusion,balloon  withdrawal  and  delivery)  characteristics  of  pregnantwomen  were  recorded,  as  well  as  fetal  data  (weight  atthe  time  of  tracheal  occlusion  and  birth,  LHR  at  the  timeof  tracheal  occlusion  and  removal  of  the  balloon,  mater-nal  and  fetal  anesthesia,  procedure  duration,  and  neonataloutcomes).Results±During  the  study  period,  28  pregnant  women,  ASA  physicalstatus  1---2,  mean  age  of  29.89  6.57  (16---38)  years,  whosefetuses  dad  severe  diaphragmatic  hernia,  and  eligible  forprenatal  endoscopic  therapy  were  selected.  Tracheal  bal-loon  insertion  was  successful  in  22  patients  (78.5%)  with±mean  gestational  age  of  26.1  1.10  (26---30)  weeks,  and±procedure  duration  was  53.39  26.38  (20---120)  min.  Therewas  failure  in  six  cases:  tracheal  occlusion  was  not  possibleand  patients  did  not  accept  new  intervention.  Mean  val-ues  and  standard  deviation  of  LHR  and  fetal  weight  at  thetime  of  tracheal  occlusion  were  0.70  0.15  (0.33---0.94)  and1045.8  222.2  (644---1464)  g,  respectively.±±All  procedures  were  performed  in  the  operating  roomunder  the  same  recommended  antisepsis  conditions  forlaparoscopic  surgeries.At  admission,  the  patients  underwent  to  the  follow-ing  preparation  before  the  procedure:  fasting  for  at  least8  h;  oral  nifedipine  (20  mg);  rectal  indomethacin  (50  mg)  8  hbefore  surgery;  intravenous  cefazolin  (1  g);  oral  nifedipine(20  mg);  ranitidine  (50  mg);  and  metoclopramide  (10  mg)  1  hbefore  intervention.in  100%  oxygen. Seventeen  patients  (60.7%)  received  intravenous  mida-zolam  (1---3  mg)  as  premedication.  Most  procedures  wereperformed  with  spinal  block:  continuous  epidural  (10  cases)and  combined  block  (17  cases);  in  one  case,  the  patienthad  von  Willebrand’s  disease  and  general  anesthesia  wasindicated.  In  this  case,  the  anesthesia  was  induced  withfentanyl,  propofol  and  rocuronium  and  maintained  withsevoflurane In  the  continuous  epidu-ral  technique,  0.25%  bupivacaine  was  used  in  two  cases(43.75 in  eight  cases±(80  8.86  mg).  In  all  cases,  the  local  anesthetic  was  associ-(cid:2)g)ated  with  an  adjuvant:  morphine  (2  mg)  or  fentanyl  (100 (cid:2)g).  Combined  blockade  was  performedor  sufentanil  (20 using  0.5%  hyperbaric  bupivacaine  (5---7.5  mg)  associated(cid:2)g).  In  50%  of  patients  (five  cases)with  sufentanil  (5---7.5 who  received  continuous  epidural,  there  was  need  forsupplementation  with  2%  lidocaine  (100  mg)  or  0.5%  bupi- 8.83  mg)  and  0.5%  bupivacaine ±vacaine  (35---40  mg)  via  catheter.  Of  the  17  patients  whounderwent  the  combined  blockade,  supplementation  withlocal  anesthetic  via  catheter  was  necessary  in  one  case  (0.5%bupivacaine  ---  50  mg).  There  was  a  need  for  sedation  duringsurgery  in  13  cases,  achieved  with  midazolam  alone  (3.1  mg)(cid:2)g),or  combined  midazolam  (1---3  mg)  and  fentanyl  (25---75 intravenously.  Of  the  13  patients  who  required  intraopera-tive  sedation,  11  also  received  midazolam  as  preanestheticmedication.  In  all  cases,  fetal  anesthesia  was  achieved  with(cid:2)g.kg−1),  pancuronium  (0.1---0.2  mg.kg−1),fentanyl  (15---20 intramuscularly  with  20G  or  22G  needle,  guided  by  ultra-sound,  at  a  total  dose  based  on  estimated  fetal  weight.There  were  no  hemodynamic  and  respiratory  changes  ormaternal  complications  related  to  the  anesthesia.  Regardingthe  surgical  procedure,  the  most  common  complicationswere  loss  of  amniotic  fluid  into  the  maternal  peritoneal  cav-ity  (one  case)  and  premature  rupture  of  membranes  (threecases)  to  withdraw  the  balloon.In  all  cases,  the  patients  were  hydrated  with  Ringer’slactate  solution  (10  mL.kg−1.h−1).After  surgery,  pregnant  women  stayed  in  the  hospital  forat  least  24  h,  at  relative  rest,  taken  oral  nifedipine  (20  mg;every  8  h)  and  analgesics,  as  needed.  After  discharge,  thepatient  returned  to  the  hospital  for  weekly  or  biweekly  pre-natal  visits  and  ultrasound  examinations.The  balloon  withdrawal  was  performed  using  a  fine  nee-dle  aspiration  guided  by  ultrasound;  gestational  age  at  thattime  was  32.8  1.58  (28---34)  weeks,  and  fetal  LHR  was1.32  0.34  (0.5---1.8),  with  an  increase  of  about  100%  com-pared  to  that  observed  at  tracheal  occlusion.±Mean  gestational  age  at  birth  was  34.96 ±±weeks  and  the  average  weight  of  newborns  was  2294 (920---3495)  g. 2.78  (27---39) 553±In the  six  cases  in  which  tracheal  occlusion  was  not  possi-ble,  there  was  one  case  of  intrauterine  death,  three  cases  ofdeath  after  birth  who  did  not  undergo  CDH  surgical  repair,and  two  newborns  survived  after  surgery  (primary  closureand  patch  placement  due  to  extensive  defect).  Of  the  22cases  of  tracheal  occlusion,  15  newborns  (68%)  survived  aftersurgery  (primary  closure  or  patch)  and  seven  died----fourcases  after  surgery  and,  in  three  cases,  the  surgical  repairwas  not  possible.  Of  the  28  cases  of  severe  CDH  selected  inthe  study  period,  17  newborns  (60.71%)  survived,  10  (35.7%)died  after  birth,  and  there  was  one  case  of  intrauterinedeath.DiscussionAbout  half  of  fetuses  with  congenital  diaphragmatic  her-nia  survive  after  postnatal  surgery.  The  other  half  diesof  pulmonary  hypoplasia.  Due  to  the  high  postnatal  mor-tality  (>90%)  associated  with  hypoplasia  and  pulmonaryhypertension  present in  fetuses  with  severe  congenitaldiaphragmatic  hernia,  early  intrauterine  treatment  tech-niques  have  been  described  to  promote  prenatal lungdevelopment  and  greater  chance  of  survival  after  birth.12Initially,  the  treatment  was  performed  by  open  surgery(hysterotomy),  but  due  to  problems  associated  with  thetechnique,  such  as  preterm  labor  and  premature  rupture  ofmembranes,  the  development  of  minimally  invasive  tech-niques  (fetoscopy)  was  encouraged  to  enable  temporary334 A.F.  Braga  et  al.tracheal  occlusion  in  order  to  minimize  or  reverse  pulmonaryhypoplasia.12---15Fetal  surgery in  humans  was  preceded  by  extensiveanimal  studies  and  demonstrated  that  tracheal  occlusionpromotes  lung  growth  and  development  through  an  effectiveand  sustained  obstruction  that  can  be  done  endoscopicallywith  a  detachable  balloon  without  tracheal  injury,  and  thesubsequent  intrauterine  reversal  of  this  obstruction  allowsin  utero  pulmonary  recovery  of  type  II  pneumocyte  and  pro-duction  of  surfactant.16---20Animal  studies  in  which  CDH  was  experimentally  devel-oped  demonstrated  that intrauterine  tracheal  occlusionallows  the  retention  of  pulmonary  secretions----the likelymechanism  of  action  responsible  for lung  developmentand  growth,  pulmonary  hypoplasia reversal,  and  LHRnormalization.15,20,21This  study  performed  at  a  university  center  in  Brazilshows  the  preliminary  results  of  the  anesthetic  techniquesused  in  fetoscopy  and  reversible  tracheal  occlusion  with  aballoon  and  the  feasibility  of  a  minimally  invasive  technique(FETO)  in  fetuses  with  severe  CDH,  intrathoracic  liver  her-niation,  and  LHR  <1.If  we  consider  mortality  greater  than  90%  in  fetuses  withsevere  CDH,  our  results  were  satisfactory  in  relation  tomaternal  safety  and  the  possibility  of  fetal  lung  develop-ment,  with  a  survival  rate  of  60.7%  for  fetuses  that  wouldhave  a  poor  prognosis  in  the  presence  of  severe  CDH.  In  2004,Deprest  et  al.22 reported  survival  and  hospital  discharge  in48%  of  the  20  cases  submitted  to  FETO.  In  a  European  multi-centre  study,  which  included  210  cases,  Jani  et  al.23 reportedresults  of  38%  and  49%  survival  in  right  and  left  CDH,  respec-tively.  Manrique  et  al.24 performed  FETO  in  nine  cases  withCDH,  with  a  survival  rate  of  45.5%  compared  with  0%  incontrol  group  who  underwent  watchful  waiting.  In  Brazil,a  study  by  Peralta  et  al.25 showed  survival  of  46.2%  in  13cases  evaluated.In  this  study,  the  inclusion  criteria  for  liver  herniationinto  the  chest  and  LHR  <  1  are  widely  accepted  as  life  treat-ing  indicators  in  CDH.26 Jani  et  al.26 observed  that  the  LHRis  directly  proportional  to  the  survival  rate.  The  authorsinvestigated  the  correlation  between  LHR  and  survival  andfound  survival  of  17%,  62%,  and  78%  in  cases  with  LHR  of0.4---0.5,  0.6---0.7,  and  0.8---0.9,  respectively,  undergoing  tra-cheal  occlusion.  It  was  significantly  higher  than  in  those  whounderwent  watchful  waiting,  with  a  survival  rate  of  0%,  0%,and  16%,  respectively.These  results  are  similar  to  those  of  other  authors  whoreported  a  lifespan  shorter  than  10%  in  watchful  waitingcases  and  50%  in  prenatal  intervention  cases.22The  right  time  for  intervention  and  occlusion  durationis  essential  to  ensure  the  quality  of  pulmonary  vessel  andairway  responses.  The  best  results  are  seen  in  surgery  per-formed  as  early  as  possible,  with  increased  survival  evenin  FETO  performed  between  the  25th  and  29th  week  ofpregnancy.7,22,27,28Unplugging  should  preferably  be  done  between  the  32ndand  34th  weeks  of  gestation,  as  studies  have  shown  that  pro-longed  tracheal  occlusion  leads  to  decreased  alveolar  type  IIpneumocyte  and  decreased  lung  surfactant,  which  can  leadto  the  development  of  hyaline  membrane  after  birth.19,29The  fetal  surgery  anesthesia involves  two  patients,mother  and  fetus,  and  therefore  care  to  ensure  maternaland  fetal  safety  should  be  considered.  Among  the  maternalcare,  in  addition  to  those  related  to  the  specific  changes  ofpregnancy,  there  are:  prevention  of  premature  labor  usingpre-,  intra-,  and  postoperative  tocolytic  agents  and  post-operative  analgesia.  Regarding  fetal  care,  attention  shouldbe  paid  to  anesthesia,  immobility,  and  prevention  of  fetalasphyxia.1,2Preterm  labor  is  the  result  of  stimulation  and  uterinecontraction  caused  by  manipulation  and  uterine  incision.This  manipulation  may  cause  placental  detachment  withdecreased  placental  blood  flow  and  fetal  anoxia.  Preven-tion  and  treatment  of  preterm  labor  are  essential  to  thesuccess  of  the  surgery  and  include  the  use  of  pre-,  intra-,  and  postoperative  tocolytic  drugs.30 However, its  usehas  been  associated  with  maternal  complications,  such  ashypotension,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  pulmonary  edema  andmetabolic  changes;  the  choice  will  dependent  on  the  mater-nal  side  effects.  Prostaglandin-synthetase  inhibitors  (such  asindomethacin),  beta-adrenergic  drugs  (such  as  terbutaline),and  calcium  channel  blockers  (such  as  nifedipine)  are  amongthe  most  commonly  used  agents.  Fetal  side  effects  have  alsobeen  described  after  using  these  agents.  The  long-term  useof  indomethacin  may  be  associated  with  renal  dysfunction,necrotizing  enterocolitis, intracranial  hemorrhage,  espe-cially  in  preterm  infants  (<30  weeks).  Regarding  nifedipine,there  are  no  reports  of  adverse  effects  in  humans,  althoughreduction  in  uterine  blood  flow  and  fetal  acidosis  have  beendemonstrated  in  animals.1,2Regarding  anesthetic the  physiologicalrespiratory  disorders  of  pregnancy  contribute theincreased  risk  of  hypoxia,  which  can  be  minimized  by  O2administration.1,2 Hyperventilation  may  be  aggravated  byanxiety  and  stress,  with  consequent  hypocapnia,  oxyhe-moglobin  curve  shift  to  the  left,  and  decreased  availabilityof  oxygen  to  the  fetus.  Additionally,  there  is  a  decrease  invenous  return,  maternal  cardiac  output,  and  uterine  bloodflow,  the  main  determinant  of  placental  flow.1,31 Thus,  it  isimportant  to  prevent  anxiety  and  pre-  and  intraoperativestress,  maintaining  the  respiratory  rate  to  avoid  PETCO2values  below  30  mmHg.1,2technique, to Gastrointestinal  changes increase  the  risk  of  gastriccontent  aspiration,  and  preventive  measures  such  as  intra-venous  metoclopramide (50  mg)and  rapid  sequence intubation  should  beconsidered.1,2,30---32(10  mg)  and  ranitidine induction  and Regarding  cardiovascular stability,  hypotension  andhypertension  and  noradrenergic  activity  with  myometrialvasoconstriction  should  be  avoided,  as  they  cause  decreaseduterine  blood  flow  with  loss  of  fetal  well-being.  The  lowervena  cava  compression  by  the  gravid  uterus  during  supineposition  causes  a  decrease  in  venous  return  and  maternalhypotension;  it  is  mandatory  to  deviate  the  uterus  to  theleft  to  prevent  fetal  asphyxia.31---33These  procedures  usually  do  not  require  general  anesthe-sia,  which  is  associated  with  a  higher  incidence  of  maternalmorbidity  and  mortality;  regional  anesthesia inmost  centers.  However,  regional  anesthesia  techniques  maypresent  some  difficulties  due  to  maternal  anxiety,  anddoes  not  provide  fetal  immobility,  with  endoscope  displace-ment,  bleeding,  fetal  trauma,  cord  compression,  and  fetaldeath.1---3,31,32 Alternatively, infiltration  of  the  skinand  subcutaneously  with  2%  lidocaine,  supplemented  withis  used local Fetoscopic  tracheal  occlusion  for  severe  congenital  diaphragmatic  hernia 335maternal  sedation,  can  be  used.  Some  authors  performedthese  procedures  with  combined  blockade  and  maternalsedation  and  found  that  remifentanil  in  continuous  infusionprovided  maternal  sedation  and  fetal  immobilization  equalto  or  higher  than  that  obtained  with  diazepam.34Deprest  et  al.,14 in  a  study  performed  in  2011,  recognizedthe  spinal  technique  as  more  advantageous  compared  withgeneral  anesthesia,  as  it  is  an  easy  to  handle  and  short  sur-gical  procedure.  Leo  et  al.35 found  that  low  doses  of  0.5%hyperbaric  bupivacaine  (7  mg)  provided  a  rapid  blockade  andeffective  anesthesia  for  cesarean  section  with  reduced  inci-dence  of  hypotension  compared  with  doses  of  8  and  9  mg.However,  due  to  its  short  duration,  the  use  of  an  epidu-ral  catheter  would  not  be  feasible  for  a  possible  need  forsupplementation.As  described in  previous  studies,22,25 the  anesthetictechnique  most  used  in  this  work  was  the  spinal  block,particularly  the  combined  blockade.  Low  doses  of  local  anes-thetics  and  adjuvants  were  used,  which  was  effective  forthe  procedure  without  maternal  hemodynamic  changes  andwith  less  need  for  catheter  supplementation  compared  withepidural  block.Although  in  53.6%  of  patients  undergoing  spinal  blockephedrine  has  been  used  in  low  doses,  the  analysis  of  theanesthetic  records  showed  hemodynamic  stability  through-out  the  surgical  procedure.  This  can  be justified  bythe  criterion  adopted,  considering  ‘‘zero  tolerance’’  forreduced  blood  pressure  and  assuming  the  use  of  vasopressorsfor  any  decrease  in  systolic  blood  pressure  below  the  base-line  pressure  levels  (pre-anesthetic).  The  crystalloid  andcolloid  administration  to  treat  hypotension  in  these  patientsshould  be  controlled,  as  the  routine  use  of  tocolytic  agentsmay  increase  the  risk  of  acute  pulmonary  edema.  Regardingthe  use  of  pressor  amines,  ephedrine,  although  it  can  causefetal  acidosis,  it  is  still  the  most  used  vasopressor  do  to  itsbeta-adrenergic  effect  and  minimal  action  on  uterine  bloodflow.1,30,36There  is  evidence  that  the  fetus  can  experience  pain,and  the  surgical  manipulation  of  an  unanesthetized  fetusesresults  in  the  autonomic  nervous  system  stimulation,  witheffects  on  heart  rate,  increased  hormone  levels  and  fetalmotor  activity,  changes  that  can  be  eliminated  with  properfetal  anesthesia.1,31,37 Among  the  opioids,  the  option  for(cid:2)g.kg−1)  due  to  the  efficacy  and  safetyfentanyl  (5---20 observed  in  premature  infants  undergoing  anesthesia.1,30,37Fetal  movements  have  been  safely  managed  with  pancuro-nium  (0.2---0.3  mg.kg−1)  or  pipecuronium  (0.2  mg.kg−1)  orvecuronium  (0.2  mg.kg−1).1,8,30,37,38 The  choice  of  pancuro-nium  in  this  study  was  due  to  its  vagolytic  activity,  withincreased  heart  rate,  desirable  to  maintain  fetal  cardiacoutput.31 Fetal  heart  rate  monitoring  was  performed  usingultrasound,  the  use  of  atropine  was  not  needed.Adequate  postoperative  analgesia  has  been  achievedwith  local  anesthetics  and  morphine  administered  througha  catheter  in  the  epidural  space  that  extremely  importantfor  the  fetal  surgery  success  due  to  its  role  in  pretermlabor  prevention.1 The  study  results  allow  concluding  thatFETO  is  a  minimally  invasive  technique  for  severe  congenitaldiaphragmatic  hernia  repair  and  provides  lung  developmentand  postnatal  survival.  This  anesthetic  technique  selectionshould  be  considered  for  a  successful  procedure,  and  thecombined  blockade  associated  with  sedation  and  fetal  anes-thesia  proved  to  be  safe  and  effective  for  tracheal  occlusion.Conflicts of interestThe  authors  declare  no  conflicts  of  interest.References1.
