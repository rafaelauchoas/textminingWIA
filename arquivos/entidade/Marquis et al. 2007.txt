The underlying argumentation theory is Dung’s one: each argumentation system gives both a set of argumentsand the way they interact (i.e., attack or non-attack) according to the corresponding agent. The inadequacy of the simple, yetappealing, method which consists in voting on the agents’ selected extensions calls for a new approach. To this purpose, a gen-eral framework for merging argumentation systems from Dung’s theory of argumentation is presented. The objective is achievedthrough a three-step process: first, each argumentation system is expanded into a partial system over the set of all arguments con-sidered by the group of agents (reflecting that some agents may easily ignore arguments pointed out by other agents, as well as howsuch arguments interact with her own ones); then, merging is used on the expanded systems as a way to solve the possible conflictsbetween them, and a set of argumentation systems which are as close as possible to the whole profile is generated; finally, votingis used on the selected extensions of the resulting systems so as to characterize the acceptable arguments at the group level.© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionArgumentation is based on the exchange and the evaluation of interacting arguments which may represent informa-tion of various kinds, especially beliefs or goals. Argumentation can be used for modeling some aspects of reasoning,decision making, and dialogue; as such, it has been applied to several domains, including law. For instance, whenan agent has conflicting beliefs (viewed as arguments), a (nontrivial) set of plausible consequences can be derivedthrough argumentation from the most acceptable arguments for the agent (additional information like a plausibilityordering are often taken into account in the evaluation phase). Much work has been devoted to this reasoning issue(see for example [1,13,21,25–27]).✩ This paper is an extended and revised version of a paper entitled “Merging Argumentation Systems” that appeared in the Proceedings ofAAAI’05, pp. 614–619.* Corresponding author.E-mail address: coste@cril.univ-artois.fr (S.

Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753731Several theories of argumentation exist; many of them make explicit the nature of arguments, the way arguments aregenerated, how they interact and how to evaluate them, and finally a characterization of the most acceptable arguments.A key issue is the interaction between arguments which is typically based on a notion of attack; for example, when anargument takes the form of a logical proof, arguments for a statement and arguments against it can be put forward. Inthat case, the attack relation relies on logical inconsistency.Dung’s theory of argumentation includes several formal systems developed so far for commonsense reasoning orlogic programming [13]. It is abstract enough to manage without any assumptions on the nature of arguments or theattack relation. Indeed, an argumentation system à la Dung consists of a set of (abstract) arguments, together witha binary relation on it (the attack relation). Several semantics can be used for defining interesting sets of arguments(so-called extensions) from which acceptable sets of arguments (i.e., the derivable sets) can be characterized.In a multi-agent setting, argumentation can also be used to represent (part of) some information exchange processes,like negotiation, or persuasion (see for example [3–5,18,22,24,28]). For instance, a negotiation process between twoagents about whether some belief must be considered as true given some evidence can be modeled as a two-playergame where each move consists in reporting an argument which attacks arguments given by the opponent.In this paper, we also consider argumentation in a multi-agent setting, but from a very different perspective. Basi-cally, our purpose is to characterize the set of arguments acceptable by a group of agents, when the data furnished byeach agent consist solely of an (abstract) argumentation system from Dung’s theory.At a first glance, a simple approach for achieving this goal consists in voting on the acceptable sets provided by eachagent: a set of arguments is considered acceptable by the group if and only if it is acceptable for “sufficiently many”agents from the group (where the meaning of “sufficiently many” refers to different voting methods). No merging atall is required here. By means of example, we show that our merging-based approach leads to results which are muchmore expected than those furnished by a direct vote on the (sets of) arguments acceptable by each agent.Our approach is more sophisticated. It follows a three-step process: first, each argumentation system is expandedinto a partial system over the set of all arguments considered by the group of agents (reflecting that some agents mayeasily ignore arguments pointed out by other agents, as well as how such arguments interact with her own ones);then, merging is used on the expanded systems as a way to solve the possible conflicts between them, and a set ofargumentation systems which are as close as possible to the whole profile is generated; finally, the last step consistsin selecting the acceptable arguments at the group levels from the set of argumentation systems.In order to reach this goal, we first introduce a notion of partial argumentation system, which extends Dung’sargumentation system so as to represent ignorance concerning the attack relation. This is necessary in our settingsince all the agents participating in the merging process are not assumed to share the same global set of arguments.Accordingly, the argumentation system furnished by each agent is first expanded into a partial argumentation system,and all such partial systems are built over the same set of arguments, those pointed out by at least one agent. Ofcourse, there exist many different ways to incorporate a new argument into an argumentation system. Each agent canhave her own expansion policy. We mention some possible policies, and focus on one of them, called the consensualexpansion: when incorporating a new argument into her own system, an agent is ready to conclude that this argumentattacks (resp. is attacked by) another argument whenever all the other agents who are aware of both arguments agreewith this attack; otherwise, she concludes that she ignores whether an attack takes place or not.Once all the expansions of the input argumentation systems have been computed, the proper merging step can beachieved; it consists in computing all the argumentation systems over the global set of arguments which are “as closeas possible” to the partial systems generated during the last stage. Closeness is characterized by a notion of distancebetween an argumentation system and a profile of partial systems, induced from a primitive notion of distance betweenpartial systems and an aggregation function. Several primitive distances and aggregation functions can be used; wemainly focus on the edit distance (which is, roughly speaking, the number of insertions/deletions of attacks needed toturn a given system into another one), and consider sum, max and leximax as aggregation functions.Like the input of the overall merging process, the result of the merging step is a set of argumentation systems.However, while the first one reflects different points of view (since each system is provided by a specific agent), thesecond set expresses some uncertainty on the merging due to the presence of conflicts. The last step of the processconsists in defining the acceptable arguments for the group under the uncertainty provided by this set of argumentationsystems. Once again, several sensible definitions are given. We show that the sets of arguments considered acceptablewhen the input is the set of argumentation systems primarily furnished by the agents may drastically differ from the732S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753sets of arguments considered acceptable after the merging step, and by means of example, we show that the latter onesare more in accordance with the intuition.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After a refresher on Dung’s theory of argumentation (in which ourapproach takes place), we give a simple motivating example (Section 3) which shows that voting on the argumentsaccepted by each agent is not adequate for defining the arguments accepted by the group. Then we introduce a notionof partial argumentation system (Section 4) which extends the notion of argumentation system and enables to handlethe case when agents do not share the same set of arguments. On this ground, we define a family of merging operatorsfor argumentation systems (Section 5) and we study the properties of some of them (especially, those based on theedit distance) (Section 6). Then, we focus on acceptability for partial argumentation systems (Section 7). Finally, weconclude the paper and give a short presentation of some possible refinements of our framework (Section 8).2. Dung’s theory of argumentationLet us present some basic definitions at work in Dung’s theory of argumentation [13]. We restrict them to finiteargumentation frameworks.Definition 1 (Argumentation system (AF)). A (finite) argumentation system AF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) over A is given by a finite setA of arguments and a binary relation R on A called an attack relation. aiRaj means that ai attacks aj (also denotedby (ai, aj ) ∈ R).For our study, we are not interested in the structure of arguments and we consider an arbitrary attack relation.(cid:3)A, R(cid:4) defines a directed graph G called the attack graph.Example 2. The argumentation system AF = (cid:3)A = {a1, a2, a3, a4}, R = {(a2, a3), (a4, a3), (a1, a2)}(cid:4) defines the fol-lowing graph G:Acceptability is about the selection of the most acceptable arguments. Two mainstream approaches exist:• Individual acceptability: acceptability of an argument depends only on its properties (see [2,16]);• Collective acceptability: an argument can be defended by other arguments; in this case, the acceptability of a setof arguments is considered (see [13]).Dung’s theory is concerned with the second approach. Whether an argument can be accepted depends on the wayarguments interact. Collective acceptability is based on two key notions: lack of conflict between arguments andcollective defense.Definition 3. (See [13].) Let (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) be an argumentation system.Conflict-free set A set E ⊆ A is conflict-free if and only if (cid:2)a, b ∈ E such that aRb.Collective defense Consider E ⊆ A, a ∈ A. E (collectively) defends a if and only if ∀b ∈ A, if bRa, then ∃c ∈ Esuch that cRb (a is said acceptable w.r.t. E). E defends all its elements if and only if ∀a ∈ E, E collectivelydefends a.Dung defines several semantics for collective acceptability based on those two notions [13]. Among them theadmissible semantics, the preferred semantics, the stable semantics and the grounded semantics.S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753733Definition 4. (See [13].) Let (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) be an argumentation system.Admissible semantics A set E ⊆ A is admissible if and only if E is conflict-free and E defends all its elements.Preferred semantics A set E ⊆ A is a preferred extension if and only if E is maximal for set inclusion among theadmissible sets.Stable semantics A set E ⊆ A is a stable extension if and only if E is conflict-free and every a ∈ A \ E is attackedby an element of E.Grounded semantics The grounded extension of (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) is the smallest subset of A with respect to set inclusion amongthe subsets of A which are admissible and coincide with the set of arguments acceptable w.r.t. itself.Note that in all the above definitions, each attacker of a given argument is considered independently of the otherattackers (there is no way to represent synergetic effects and the possibility to quantify all attackers as a whole is notconsidered—there exist other works which are concerned with this aspect, see [6,8–10,19,23]).Definition 5 (Well-founded argumentation system [13]). An argumentation framework AF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) is well-foundedif and only if there does not exist an infinite sequence a0, a1, . . . , an . . . of arguments from A, such that for each i,ai+1Rai .Among other things, It is shown in [13] that:• Any admissible set of (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) is included in a preferred extension of (cid:3)A, R(cid:4).• Each (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) has at least one preferred extension.• Each (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) has exactly one grounded extension of (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) and this extension is included in each preferred exten-sion.• If (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) is well-founded then it has a unique preferred extension which is also the only stable extension and thegrounded extension.• Any stable extension of (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) is also a preferred extension (the converse is false).• Some (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) do not have a stable extension.The acceptability status of each subset of arguments can now be defined by the following relation:Definition 6 (Acceptability relation). An acceptability relation, denoted by AccAF, for a given argumentation systemAF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4), is a total function from 2A to {true, false} which associates each subset E of A with true if E is anacceptable set for AF and with false otherwise.Usually, an acceptability relation is based on a specific semantics (plus a selection principle). For instance, a setof arguments can be considered acceptable if and only if it is included in one extension (credulous selection) or inevery extension (skeptical selection). Alternatively, a set of arguments can be considered acceptable if and only if itcoincides with one extension for the chosen semantics. Whatever the way it is defined, an acceptability relation canbe viewed as a choice function among the elements of 2A. In this context, the “acceptability of an argument” a cancorrespond either to the acceptability of the singleton {a}, or to the membership of a to an acceptable set (see [12]).3. Simple is not so beautifulGiven a profile (i.e., a vector) P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) of n AFs (with n (cid:2) 1) where each AFi = (cid:3)Ai, Ri(cid:4) representsi Ai which are acceptable by the group of nthe data given by Agent i, our purpose is to determine the subsets ofagents. Voting is one way to achieve this goal.(cid:2)3.1. Voting is not enoughIndeed, a simple approach to address the problem consists in considering a set of arguments acceptable for thegroup when it is acceptable for “sufficiently many” agents of the group. The voting method under consideration makes734S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753precise what “sufficiently many” means: it can be, for instance, simple majority. Let us illustrate such an approach onan example:Example 7. Consider the three following argumentation systems:• AF1 = (cid:3){a, b, e, f }, {(a, b), (b, a), (e, f )}(cid:4),• AF2 = (cid:3){b, c, d, e, f }, {(b, c), (c, d), (f, e)}(cid:4),• AF3 = (cid:3){e, f }, {(e, f )}(cid:4).Whatever the chosen semantics (among Dung’s ones), c does not belong to any extension of AF2. As c is not knownby the two other agents, it cannot be considered as acceptable by the group whatever the voting method (under thereasonable assumption that it is a choice function based on extensions, i.e., only subsets of an extension of an AFi areeligible as acceptable sets). However since c (resp. a) is not among the arguments reported by the first agent and thethird one (resp. the second and the third ones), it can be sensible to assume that the three agents agree on the fact thata attacks b, b attacks a and b attacks c. Indeed, this assumption is compatible with any of the three argumentationsystems reported by the agents. Under this assumption, it makes sense to consider {c} credulously acceptable for thegroup given that c is considered defended by a against b by Agent 1 and there is no conflicting evidence about it inthe AFs provided by the two other agents.As this example illustrates it, our claim is that, in general, voting is not a satisfying way to aggregate the datafurnished by the different agents under the form of argumentation systems. Two problems arise:Problem 1. Voting makes sense only if all agents consider the same set of arguments A at start (otherwise, the set 2Aof alternatives is not common to all agents). However, it can be the case that the sets of arguments reported by theagents differ from one another.Problem 2. Voting relies only on the selected extensions: the attack relations (from which extensions are character-ized) are not taken into consideration any more once extensions have been computed. This leads to much significantinformation being set aside which could be exploited to define the sets of acceptable arguments at the group level.3.2. Union is not merging (in general)(cid:2)In order to solve both problems, a simple approach (at a first glance) consists in forming the union of the argu-(cid:3)Ai, Ri(cid:4) and defined(cid:2)ni=1 Ri(cid:4). Unfortunately, such a merging approach to argumentation systems cannot be takenmentation systems AF1, . . . , AFn, i.e., considering the argumentation system denoted AF =by AF = (cid:3)seriously. Let us illustrate it on our running example:(cid:2)ni=1 Ai,ni=1(cid:2)3i=1 AFi = (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e, f }, {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c), (c, d), (e, f ),Example 7 (continued). The resulting AF is(f, e)}(cid:4).Example 7 shows that the union approach to merging argumentation systems suffers from a major problem: it solvesconflicts by giving to the explicit attack information some undue prominence to implicit non-attack information. Thus,when a pair of arguments (like, say (f, e)) does not belong to the attack relation furnished by an agent (say, Agent 1)while both arguments (f and e) belong to the set of arguments she points out, the meaning is that for Agent 1,S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753735argument f does not attack argument e. Imagine now that in the considered profile of argumentation systems, 999agents report the same system as Agent 1, and the 1000th agent is Agent 2. In the resulting argumentation systemconsidered at the group level, assuming that union is used as a merging operator, it will be the case that f attacks ewhile 999 agents over 1000 believes that it is not the case!4. Partial argumentation systemsThe example introduced in the previous section has illustrated that different cases must be taken into account:• an argument exists in the argumentation system AF1 of one of the agents and does not exist in the argumentationsystem AF2 of at least another agent;• an interaction between two arguments exists in the argumentation system AF1 of one agent and does not exist inthe argumentation system AF2 of at least another agent.In the first case, the new argument can be added to AF2 but the question is what to do for the interactions betweenthis new argument and the other arguments of AF2.In the second case, things are different: if an interaction between two arguments a and b exists in a system AF1and not in another system AF2, even when a and b are in AF2, we cannot add the interaction in AF2 (that Agent 2did not include this attack in AF2 is on purpose). Indeed, if an interaction is not present in an AF, it means that thisinteraction does not exist for the corresponding agent. The consequence of this is the necessity to discriminate amongseveral cases whenever an argument a has to be added to an AF. Let b be an argument of the AF under consideration,three cases must be considered:• the agent believes that the interaction (a, b) exists (attack);• the agent believes that the interaction (a, b) does not exist (non-attack);• the agent does not know whether the interaction (a, b) exists (ignorance).The first two cases express the fact that the knowledge of the agent is sufficient for computing the new interactionconcerning a. The third case expresses that the agent is not able to compute the new interaction concerning a and thearguments she pointed out (several reasons can explain it, especially a lack of information, or a lack of computationalresources).Handling these different kinds of information within a uniform setting calls for an extension1 of the notion ofargumentation systems, that we call partial argumentation systems.Definition 8 (Partial argumentation system (PAF)). A (finite) partial argumentation system over A is a quadruplePAF = (cid:3)A, R, I, N(cid:4) where• A is a finite set of arguments,• R, I, N are binary relations on A:– R is the attack relation,– I is called the ignorance relation and is such that R ∩ I = ∅,– and N = (A × A) \ (R ∪ I ) is called the non-attack relation.N is deduced from A, R and I , so a partial argumentation system can be fully specified by (cid:3)A, R, I (cid:4). We use bothnotations in the following.1 In [11], a new binary relation on the arguments is also introduced in Dung’s argumentation framework: however, this new relation representsa notion of support between arguments. Clearly enough, this is unrelated with the relation introduced here representing the ignorance about theattack between arguments.736S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753Each AF is a particular PAF for which the set I is empty (we say that such an AF is equivalent to the associatedPAF). In an AF, the N relation also exists even if it is not given explicitly (I = ∅ and N = A × A \ R). So, an AFcould also be denoted by (cid:3)A, R, N(cid:4).Each PAF over A can be viewed as a compact representation of a set of AFs over A, called its completions:Definition 9 (Completion of a PAF). Let PAF = (cid:3)A, R, I (cid:4). Let AF = (cid:3)A, S(cid:4). AF is a completion of PAF if and only ifR ⊆ S ⊆ R ∪ I .The set of all completions of PAF is denoted C(PAF).Example 10. The partial argumentation system PAF = (cid:3)A = {a, b, c, d}, R = {(a, b), (a, c)}, I = {(c, a), (b, d)},N = {(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (d, d), (b, a), (b, c), (c, b), (a, d), (d, a), (d, b), (c, d), (d, c)}(cid:4) is illustrated on the follow-ing figure (solid arrows represent the attack relation and dotted arrows represent the ignorance relation; non-attackrelations are not represented explicitly as in the AF case):The completions of this PAF are:Now, Problem 1 can be addressed by first associating each argumentation system AFi with a corresponding PAFi(cid:2)ni=1 Ai . To this end, we introduce the notion of expansion ofso that all PAFi are about the same set of argumentsan AF:Definition 11 (Expansion of an AF). Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of n AFs such that AFi = (cid:3)Ai, Ri, Ni(cid:4).Let AF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) be an argumentation system. An expansion of AF given P is any PAF exp(AF, P) defined byi Ai, R(cid:12), I (cid:12), N (cid:12)(cid:4) such that R ⊆ R(cid:12) and (A × A) \ R ⊆ N (cid:12). exp is referred to as an expansion function.(cid:3)A ∪(cid:2)In order to be general enough, this definition does not impose many constraints on the resulting PAF: what isimportant is to preserve the attack and non-attack relations from the initial AF while extending its set of arguments.Many policies can be used to give rise to expansions of different kinds, reflecting the various attitudes of agents inlight of “new” arguments; for instance, if a is any argument considered by Agent i at the start and a “new” argumentb has to be incorporated, Agent i can (among other things):• always reject b (e.g., adding (b, b) to her relation R(cid:12)• always accept b (adding (a, b), (b, a) and (b, b) to her non-attack relation N (cid:12)i ),• just express her ignorance about b (adding (a, b), (b, a) and (b, b) to her ignorance relation I (cid:12)i ).i ),Each agent may also compute the exact interaction between a and b when the attack relation is not primitive butdefined from more basic notions (as in the approach by Elvang-Gøransson et al., see e.g., [15–17]). Note that if shehas limited computational resources, Agent i can compute exact interactions as far as she can, then express ignorancefor the remaining ones.In the following, we specifically focus on consensual expansions. Intuitively, the consensual expansion of an ar-gumentation system AF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) given a profile of such systems is obtained by adding a pair of arguments (a, b)(where at least one of a, b is not in A) into the attack (resp. the non-attack relation) provided that all other agents ofS. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753737the profile who know the two arguments agree on the existence of the attack2 (resp. the non-attack); otherwise, it isadded to the ignorance relation.This expansion policy is sensible as soon as each agent has a minimum level of confidence in the other agents: ifa piece of information conveyed by one agent is not conflicting with the information stemming from the other agents,every agent of the group is ready to accept it.Definition 12 (Consensual expansion). Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of n AFs such that AFi = (cid:3)Ai, Ri(cid:4).Let AF = (cid:3)A, R, N(cid:4) be an argumentation system. Let conf (P) = (i Ni) be the set of interactions forwhich a conflict exists within the profile. The consensual expansion of AF over P is the tuple denoted by expC =(cid:3)A(cid:12), R(cid:12), I (cid:12), N (cid:12)(cid:4) with:i Ri) ∩ ((cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)i Ai ,(cid:2)• A(cid:12) = A ∪• R(cid:12) = R ∪ ((• I (cid:12) = conf (P) \ (R ∪ N),• N (cid:12) = (A(cid:12) × A(cid:12)) \ (R(cid:12) ∪ I (cid:12)).i Ri \ conf (P)) \ N),The next proposition states that, as expected, the consensual expansion of an argumentation system over a profileis an expansion:Proposition 13. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of n AFs such that AFi = (cid:3)Ai, Ri(cid:4). Let AF = (cid:3)A, R, N(cid:4) be anargumentation system. The consensual expansion expC of AF over P is an expansion of AF over P in the sense ofDefinition 11.Proof. Consider (a, b) ∈ A(cid:12) × A(cid:12). There are several cases:• if (a, b) ∈ R then (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ I (cid:12) ∪ N (cid:12) (so, R ⊆ R(cid:12));• if (a, b) /∈ R and (a, b) ∈ N then (a, b) /∈ I (cid:12) ∪ R(cid:12) and (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12) (so, N ⊆ N (cid:12));• if (a, b) /∈ R ∪ N then there are two cases:– if (cid:2)AFi ∈ P such that a, b ∈ Ai then (a, b) /∈ conf (P); so, (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ R(cid:12) ∪ I (cid:12);– if ∃AFi ∈ P such that a, b ∈ Ai then we have 4 possible cases:if (a, b) ∈ Ri and (cid:2)AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Nj then (a, b) /∈ conf (P); so, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ N (cid:12) ∪ I (cid:12);if (a, b) ∈ Ri and ∃AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Nj then (a, b) ∈ conf (P); so, (a, b) ∈ I (cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ R(cid:12) ∪ N (cid:12);if (a, b) ∈ Ni and (cid:2)AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rj then (a, b) /∈ conf (P); so, (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ R(cid:12) ∪ I (cid:12);if (a, b) ∈ Ni and ∃AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rj then (a, b) ∈ conf (P); so, (a, b) ∈ I (cid:12) and (a, b) /∈ R(cid:12) ∪ N (cid:12).So, R(cid:12), I (cid:12) and N (cid:12) form a partition of A(cid:12) × A(cid:12) which satisfies R ⊆ R(cid:12) and N ⊆ N (cid:12). (cid:2)The consensual expansion is among the most cautious expansions one can define since it leads to adding a pair ofarguments in the attack (or the non-attack relation) associated with an agent only when all the other agents agree on it.Example 14. Consider the profile consisting of the following four argumentation systems:• AF1 = (cid:3)A1 = {a, b}, R1 = {(a, b), (b, a)}(cid:4),• AF2 = (cid:3)A2 = {b, c, d}, R2 = {(b, c), (c, d)}(cid:4),• AF3 = (cid:3)A3 = {a, b, d}, R3 = {(a, b), (a, d)}(cid:4),• AF4 = (cid:3)A4 = {a, b, d}, R4 = {(b, d), (b, a)}(cid:4).2 i.e., if a, b ∈ Ai , then (a, b) ∈ Ri .738S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753For each i, the consensual expansion PAFi of AFi is given by:• PAF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c), (c, d)}, {(a, d), (b, d)}(cid:4),• PAF2 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(b, c), (c, d)}, {(a, b), (b, a), (a, d)}(cid:4),• PAF3 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (a, d), (b, c), (c, d), {}}(cid:4),• PAF4 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(b, d), (b, a), (b, c), (c, d), {}}(cid:4).When the expansion policies considered by each agent are the same one exp, for any profile P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)we shall often note exp(P) the profile of PAFs (cid:3)exp(AF1, P), . . . , exp(AFn, P)(cid:4).5. Merging operatorsIn order to deal with Problem 2, we propose to merge interactions instead of sets of acceptable arguments. Thegoal is to characterize the argumentation systems which are as close as possible to the given profile of argumentationsystems, taken as a whole.A way to achieve this consists in defining a notion of “distance” between an AF and a profile of AFs, or moregenerally between a PAF and a profile of PAFs. This calls for a notion of pseudo-distance between two PAFs, anda way to combine such pseudo-distances:Definition 15 (Pseudo-distance). A pseudo-distance d between PAFs over A is a mapping which associates a non-negative real number to each pair of PAFs over A and satisfies the properties of symmetry (d(x, y) = d(y, x)) andminimality (d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y).d is a distance if it satisfies also the triangular inequality (d(x, z) (cid:3) d(x, y) + d(y, z)).Definition 16 (Aggregation function). An aggregation function is a mapping ⊗ from (R+)n to (R+) (strictly speaking,it is a family of mappings, one for each n), that satisfiesi , then ⊗(x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xn) (cid:2) ⊗(x1, . . . , x(cid:12)i, . . . , xn),• if xi (cid:2) x(cid:12)• ⊗(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 if ∀i, xi = 0,• ⊗(x) = x.(non-decreasingness)(minimality)(identity)The merging of a profile of AFs is defined as a set of AFs:Definition 17 (Merging of n AFs). Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of n AFs. Let d be any pseudo-distancebetween PAFs, let ⊗ be an aggregation function, and let exp1, . . . , expn be n expansion functions. The merging ofP is the set of AFsS.

Note that considering expansion functions specific toeach agent is possible. What is important is that expi(AFi, P) is a PAF over A =fusion: The AFs over A that are selected as the result of the merging process are the ones that best represent P (i.e.,(cid:2)i Ai .that are the “closest” to P w.r.t. the aggregated distances).In the following, we assume that each agent uses consensual expansion. In order to lighten the notations, we remove(cid:3)exp1, . . . , expn(cid:4) from the list of parameters of merging operators.Note that it would be possible to refine Definition 17 so as to include integrity constraints into the picture. This canbe useful if there exists some (unquestionable) knowledge about the expected result (some attacks between argumentswhich have to hold for the group). It is then enough to look only to the AFs which satisfy the constraints, similarlyto what is done in propositional belief base merging (see e.g., [20]). In contrast to the belief base merging scenario,constraints on the structure of the candidate AFs can also be set. In particular, considering only acyclic AFs can provevaluable since (1) such AFs are well-founded (which implies that only one extension has to be considered whatever theunderlying semantics—among Dung’s ones), and (2) this extension (which turns out to be the grounded one, see [13])can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the AF (while computing a single extension is intractable for theother semantics in the general case—under the standard assumptions of complexity theory—see [14]).Now, many pseudo-distances between PAFs and many aggregation functions can be used, giving rise to manymerging operators. Usual aggregation functions include the sum, the max and the leximax3 but using non-symmetricfunctions is also possible (this may be particularly valuable if some agents are more important than others). Someaggregation functions (like the sum) enable the merging process to take into account the number of agents believingthat an argument attacks or not another argument:Example 7 (continued). Two agents over three agree with the fact that e attacks f and f does not attack e. It mayprove sensible that the group agrees with the majority.The choice of the aggregation function is very important for tuning the operator behavior with the expected one.For example, sum is a possible choice in order to solve conflicts using majority. Otherwise, the leximax function canprove more valuable if the aim is to behave in a more consensual way, trying to define a result close to the AF of eachagent of the group. The distinction between majority and arbitration operators as considered in propositional beliefbase merging [20] also applies here.In the following, we focus on the edit distance between PAFs:Definition 18 (Edit distance). Let PAF1 = (cid:3)A, R1, I1, N1(cid:4) and PAF2 = (cid:3)A, R2, I2, N2(cid:4) be two PAFs over A.• Let a, b be two arguments ∈ A. The edit distance between PAF1 and PAF2 over a, b is the mapping dea,b suchthat:– dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) = 0 if and only if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 or I1 ∩ I2 or N1 ∩ N2,– dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) = 1 if and only if (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ N2 or N1 ∩ R2,– dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) = 0.5 otherwise.3 When applied to a vector of n real numbers, the leximax function Leximax gives the list of those numbers sorted in a decreasing way. Suchlists are compared w.r.t. the lexicographic ordering induced by the standard ordering on real numbers.740S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753• The edit distance between PAF1 and PAF2 is given byde(PAF1, PAF2) = (cid:3)(a,b)∈A×Adea,b(PAF1, PAF2).The edit distance between two PAFs is the (minimum) number of additions/deletions which must be made to renderthem identical. Ignorance is treated as halfway between attack and non-attack.It is easy to show that:Proposition 19. The edit distance de between PAFs is a distance.Proof. We show that de and dea,b, ∀(a, b) ∈ A × A are distances, i.e. they are (1) symmetric, they satisfy (2) theminimality requirement and (3) the triangular inequality:(1) Obvious.(2) (⇒) Consider PAF1 = (cid:3)A, R1, I1, N1(cid:4) and PAF2 = (cid:3)A, R2, I2, N2(cid:4) such that PAF1 = PAF2. For all (a, b) ∈A × A, if PAF1 = PAF2 then (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 or (a, b) ∈ I1 ∩ I2 or (a, b) ∈ N1 ∩ N2. So, ∀(a, b) ∈ A × A,dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) = 0, and de(PAF1, PAF2) = 0.(⇐) Suppose de(PAF1, PAF2) = 0 and make a reductio ad absurdum: if PAF1 (cid:16)= PAF2 then ∃(a, b) ∈ A × Asuch that (a, b) /∈ R1 ∩ R2, (a, b) /∈ I1 ∩ I2 and (a, b) /∈ N1 ∩ N2; so, dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) (cid:16)= 0; so, de(PAF1,PAF2) (cid:16)= 0 which is a contradiction with the hypothesis; so, PAF1 = PAF2. The same reasoning can be achievedwith dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) = 0 and the same result is obtained: PAF1 = PAF2.(3) Consider PAF1 = (cid:3)A, R1, I1, N1(cid:4), PAF2 = (cid:3)A, R2, I2, N2(cid:4) and PAF3 = (cid:3)A, R3, I3, N3(cid:4). ∀(a, b) ∈ A × A, we com-pute and compare dea,b(PAF1, PAF2), dea,b(PAF1, PAF3) and dea,b(PAF3, PAF2), respectively denoted by x, y, z.We have three possible cases:• x = 0: ∀y, z, we have x (cid:3) y + z;• x = 0.5: x (cid:3) y + z is false if and only if y = z = 0; however, y = z = 0 implies that (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ∩ R3 or(a, b) ∈ I1 ∩ I2 ∩ I3 or (a, b) ∈ N1 ∩ N2 ∩ N3 which also implies x = 0 (contradiction with the hypothesis); so,x (cid:3) y + z;• x = 1: we have (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ N2 or (a, b) ∈ N1 ∩ R2; suppose that (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ N2 then there are 3 possiblecases:– (a, b) ∈ R3: so, y = 0, z = 1 and we have x (cid:3) y + z;– (a, b) ∈ I3: so, y = 0.5, z = 0.5 and we have x (cid:3) y + z;– (a, b) ∈ N3: so, y = 1, z = 0 and we have x (cid:3) y + z.The same reasoning can be achieved if (a, b) ∈ N1 ∩ R2. So, ∀(a, b) ∈ A × A: dea,b(PAF1, PAF2) (cid:3)dea,b(PAF1, PAF3) + dea,b(PAF3, PAF2);summing over all (a, b) ∈ A × A, we get:de(PAF1, PAF2) (cid:3) de(PAF1, PAF3) + de(PAF3, PAF2). (cid:2)Let us now illustrate the notion of edit distance as well as some associated merging operators on Example 14.Example 14 (continued). We consider the following argumentation system AF(c, d)}(cid:4).(cid:12)1= (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c),(cid:12)1 and each of the PAFs PAF1, PAF2, PAF3, PAF4 obtained by consensual expansionThe edit distance between AFfrom the profile (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4(cid:4) is:• de(AF• de(AF• de(AF• de(AF(cid:12)1, PAF1) = 1,(cid:12)1, PAF2) = 1.5,(cid:12)1, PAF3) = 2,(cid:12)1, PAF4) = 2.Taking the sum as the aggregation function, we obtain:(cid:9)4i=1 de(AF(cid:12)1, PAFi) = 6.5.S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753741Taking the max, we obtain: Max4i=1de(AFTaking the leximax, we obtain: Leximax4By computing such distances for all candidate AFs (i.e., all AFs over {a, b, c, d}), we can compute the result of the(cid:12)1, PAFi) = (2, 2, 1.5, 1).(cid:12)1, PAFi) = 2.i=1de(AFmerging:(cid:2)(cid:3)de((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AF4(cid:4)) is the set containing the two following AFs:(cid:12)• AF1(cid:12)• AF2= (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c), (c, d)}(cid:4),= (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c), (a, d), (c, d)}(cid:4).(cid:2)Maxde((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AF4(cid:4)) is the set containing AF(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1 and AF2= (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(b, a), (b, c), (a, d), (c, d)}(cid:4).(cid:2)Leximaxde(cid:12)((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AF4(cid:4)) is the singleton containing AF1.The discrepancies between the merging obtained with the various aggregation operators can be explained in thefollowing way:(cid:12)• AF1 is the most consensual AF obtained as it is almost equidistant from each PAF.(cid:12)• AF2 is much closer to PAF1, PAF2 and PAF3 than to PAF4, thus it is selected with the sum as an aggregationoperator but it is too far from PAF4 for being selected with the Max or Leximax operators.(cid:12)(cid:12)• AF2 is nearly equidistant from all four PAFs of the profile but less consensual than AFwith (cid:3) nor with Leximax but only with Max as it is not far from any of the given PAFs.(cid:12)1, thus it is selected neither(cid:12)Having AF1 in all mergings—whatever the aggregation function chosen—seems very intuitive. Indeed, whenever(cid:12)1. This is not the case foran attack (or a non-attack) is present in the (weak) majority of the initial AFs, it is also in AFthe two others AFs belonging to the above mergings.Here is another simple example:Example 20. Consider the two following argumentation systems:742S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753• AF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (c, e)}(cid:4),• AF2 = (cid:3){a, d, e, c}, {(d, a), (e, d), (e, c)}(cid:4).Note that the attack from c to e is known by Agent 1 but not by Agent 2 and the attack from e to c is known by Agent 2but not by Agent 1. This illustrates the fact that the agents do not share the same attack relation.AF1 has a unique preferred extension: {c, a}. AF2 has a unique preferred extension: {e, a}.The consensual expansions of AF1 and AF2 are respectively:• PAF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (c, e), (d, a), (e, d)}, ∅(cid:4),• PAF2 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(d, a), (e, d), (e, c), (b, a), (c, b)}, ∅(cid:4).The result of merging the profile (cid:3)AF1, AF2(cid:4) with de and ⊗ = Max (or ⊗ = Leximax) is:(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:3)AF1, AF2(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:3)AF1, AF2(cid:4)} with= {AF= (cid:2)(cid:2)Leximaxde(cid:12)(cid:12)1, AF2Maxde(cid:12)• AF1(cid:12)• AF2= (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (c, e), (d, a), (e, d), (e, c)}(cid:4),= (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (d, a), (e, d)}(cid:4).Using the sum as an aggregation function, two additional AFs are generated:(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:3)AF1, AF2(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:3)de= {AF(cid:12)(cid:12)2, AF1, AF(cid:12)3, AF(cid:12)4}, with(cid:12)• AF3(cid:12)• AF4= (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (c, e), (e, d), (d, a)}(cid:4),= (cid:3){a, b, c, d, e}, {(b, a), (c, b), (e, c), (e, d), (d, a)}(cid:4).Each of the resulting mergings contains an argumentation system from which argument a can be derived, as it isthe case in AF1 and AF2. Using the sum as an aggregation function leads to the most consensual result here since it(cid:12)(cid:12)4 is equivalent to PAF2.3 is equivalent to PAF1 and AFpreserves the initial AFs of the different agents. Indeed, AF6. Some propertiesLet us now present some properties of consensual expansions and merging operators based on the edit distance,showing them as interesting choices.S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–7537436.1. Properties of PAFs and consensual expansionsIntuitively speaking, a natural requirement on any AF resulting from a merging is that it preserves all the informa-tion which are shared by the agents participating in the merging process, and more generally, all the information onwhich the agents participating in the merging process do not disagree.In order to show that our merging operators satisfy those requirements, one first need the notions of clash-free partand of common part of a profile of PAFs:Definition 21 (Clash-free part of a profile of PAFs). Let P = (cid:3)PAF1, . . . , PAFn(cid:4) be a profile of PAFs. The clash-freepart of P is denoted by CFP(P) and is defined by:(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)CFP(P) =Ai,Ri \Ni, ICFP,Ni \where ICFP = ((cid:2)ii Ai ×ii(cid:2)i Ai) \ (((cid:2)i Ri \(cid:2)i(cid:2)ii Ni) ∪ (Rii Ni \(cid:2)i Ri)).The clash-free part of a profile of PAFs represents the pieces of information (attack/non-attack) that are not ques-tioned by any other agent. As they are not the source of any disagreement, they are expected to be included in eachAF resulting from the merging process.Example 14 (continued). With P = (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4(cid:4), CFP(P) = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(b, c), (c, d)}, {(a, b), (b, a),(a, d), (b, d), (a, c), (c, a)}(cid:4).Note that with expC(P) = (cid:3)expC(AF1, P), . . . , expC(AF4, P)(cid:4), CFP(expC(P)) = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(b, c), (c, d)},{(a, b), (b, a), (a, d), (b, d)}(cid:4) (now (a, c) and (c, a) are non-attacks); so CFP(P) (cid:16)= CFP(expC(P)).Definition 22 (Common part of a profile of PAFs). Let P = (cid:3)PAF1, . . . , PAFn(cid:4) be a profile of PAFs. The common part(cid:12)of P is denoted by CP(P) and is defined by: CP(P) = (cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i Ai,i Ri,i Ii,i Ni(cid:4).The common part of a profile of PAFs is a much more demanding notion than the clash-free one. It represents thepieces of information on which all the agents agree. There is no doubt that those pieces of information must hold inany consensual view of the group’s opinion, so the common part of the profile must be included in each AF of theresult of the merging process.Example 14 (continued). With P = (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4(cid:4), CP(P) = (cid:3){b}, ∅, ∅, {(b, b)}(cid:4).We have the following easy property:Proposition 23. Let P = (cid:3)PAF1, . . . , PAFn(cid:4) be a profile of PAFs. The common part of P is pointwise included into theclash-free part of P, i.e.:(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i Ri \i Ri ⊆i Ii ⊆ ICFP;i Ni ⊆(cid:2)i Ni \i Ni ;(cid:2)i Ri .Proof. The proof is straightforward:(cid:12)(cid:2)••••i Ri ⊆(a, b) ∈ Rk ∩ Nk that is impossible by definition), so(cid:2)i Ri is obvious; and we also have ∀(a, b) ∈(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:2)i Ri ⊆i Ri \i Ni .• In the same way, we can prove(cid:12)• if ∀(a, b) ∈(cid:2)i Ni) ∪ ((cid:2)i Ii then, by definition, (a, b) /∈ Ri and (a, b) /∈ Ni for all i; so, (a, b) ∈ (i Ni \i Ri)).

Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753The common part of a profile of n PAFs (resp. AFs) is not always a PAF (resp. an AF). Contrastingly, the clash-freepart of a profile of n PAFs is a PAF (however, the clash-free part of a profile of n AFs is not always an AF).There exists an interesting particular case: if the various PAFs of the profile are based on the same set of argumentsand if for each ordered pair of arguments (a, b) such that (a, b) belongs to the ignorance relation in one PAF, this pairbelongs to the attack relation for another PAF of the profile and to the non-attack relation for at least a third PAF ofthe profile, then the clash-free part of the profile and its common part are identical:Proposition 24. Let P = (cid:3)PAF1, . . . , PAFn(cid:4) be a profile of n PAFs over the same set of arguments A. Consider theclash-free part of P denoted by CFP(P) = (cid:3)ACFP, RCFP, ICFP, NCFP(cid:4) and the common part of P denoted by CP(P) =(cid:2)(cid:3)ACP, RCP, ICP, NCP(cid:4). Ifi Ii ⊆ conf (P) = (i Ni), we have:i Ri) ∩ ((cid:2)(cid:2)• ACFP = ACP,• RCFP = RCP,• NCFP = NCP.Proof. All the PAFs are over the same set of arguments, so we have A =First, we prove that RCFP = RCP.(cid:2)i Ai =(cid:12)i Ai and ACFP = ACP.• RCFP ⊆ RCP: consider (a, b) ∈ RCFP; so (a, b) ∈(a, b) /∈ Rk; so (a, b) ∈ Nk or (a, b) ∈ Ik;i Ri \In the first case, we have (a, b) /∈In the second case, we retrieve the first case becauseThus (a, b) ∈ RCP.(cid:2)(cid:2)• RCFP ⊇ RCP: given by Proposition 23.(cid:2)i Ri \(cid:2)i Ni ; suppose that (a, b) /∈ RCP; so ∃PAFk such thati Ni : contradiction with the hypothesis (a, b) ∈ RCFP;(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)i Ii ⊆ conf (P) = (i Ri) ∩ (i Ni).NCFP = NCP is proven in the same way. (cid:2)This result is interesting since this situation always holds (by definition) if consensual expansion is used as anexpansion policy by each agent.Example 14 (continued).

Let AF1 = (cid:3)A1, R1(cid:4), AF2 = (cid:3)A2, R2(cid:4) be two AFs. AF1, AF2 are said to be concordantif and only if ∀(a, b) ∈ (A1 ∩ A2) × (A1 ∩ A2), (a, b) ∈ R1 if and only if (a, b) ∈ R2. Otherwise they are said to bediscordant.Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. P is said to be concordant if and only if all its AFs are pairwiseconcordant. Otherwise it is said to be discordant.Of course, concordance is related to the set conf (P) representing clashes between attack and non-attack relationsin the different AFs of the profile:Proposition 27. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of argumentation systems. P is concordant if and only ifconf (P) =(cid:2)(cid:2)i Ri ∩i Ni is empty.Proof.

(cid:2)(cid:2)Proposition 29. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. P is concordant if and only if expC(P) =(cid:3)expC(AF1, P), . . . , expC(AFn, P)(cid:4) is reduced to (cid:3)i AFi(cid:4) (i.e., each of the n elements of the vector isi AFi, . . . ,(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)i AFi ).Proof. Consider a concordant profile of AFs P. ∀AFi = (cid:3)Ai, Ri, Ni(cid:4), let us consider expC(AFi, P) = (cid:3)A(cid:12)∀a, b ∈i Ai , there are several cases:(cid:2)i, R(cid:12)i, I (cid:12)i , N (cid:12)i(cid:4).746S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753• if (a, b) ∈ Ri then (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)i ;• if (a, b) /∈ Ri and (a, b) ∈ Ai × Ai then (a, b) ∈ Ni , so (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12)(cid:2)AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rj ;• if (a, b) /∈ Ri and (a, b) /∈ Ai × Ai then there are two cases:– either ∃AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rj : because P is concordant, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)i ;– or (cid:2)AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rj : so, (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12)i .i ; with P concordant, we also know thatIn all the cases, if (a, b) is an attack interaction for one of the AFi , (a, b) is also an attack interaction for the consensualPAFs. So, all the consensual PAFs are equal to(cid:2)For the second part of the proof, consider expC(P) = (cid:3)i AFi(cid:4). We suppose that P is discordant.So, ∃AFi, AFj ∈ P such that ∃a, b ∈ Ai ∩ Aj and (a, b) ∈ (Ri \ Rj ) ∪ (Rj \ Ri). If we suppose that (a, b) ∈ Ri , thenexpC(AFj , P) cannot contain the attack (a, b); so, expC(AFj , P) (cid:16)=i AFi : contradiction. And the same problemappears when we suppose that (a, b) ∈ Rj . So, P is concordant. (cid:2)i AFi, , . . . ,(cid:2)i AFi .(cid:2)(cid:2)Note that(cid:2)i AFi may appear into expC(P), even if P is discordant. This is illustrated by the following example:Example 30. Consider the profile P = (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3(cid:4) consisting of the following three AFs:• AF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c}, {(a, b), (a, c)}(cid:4),• AF2 = (cid:3){a, b, c}, {(a, c)}(cid:4),• AF3 = (cid:3){a, d}, {(a, d)}(cid:4).The profile P = (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3(cid:4) is discordant and expC(P) = (cid:3)PAF1, PAF2, PAF3(cid:4) is such that:• PAF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, b), (a, c), (a, d)}, ∅(cid:4) (=• PAF2 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, c), (a, d)}, ∅(cid:4),• PAF3 = (cid:3){a, b, c, d}, {(a, c), (a, d)}, {(a, b)}(cid:4).(cid:2)i AFi ),The following proposition states that whenever the presence of an attack (a, b) does not clash with a profile of AFs,such an attack is present in all the corresponding PAFs obtained by consensual expansion if and only if it is present inone of the input AFs.Proposition 31. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. Let (a, b) be a pair of arguments such that a, b ∈and (cid:2)AFi, AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ (Ri \ Rj ) ∪ (Rj \ Ri).∃AFl ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rl if and only if ∀AFk ∈ P, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)k with R(cid:12)k denoting the attack relation of the(cid:2)i AiPAF expC(AFk, P).Proof. Consider AFk ∈ P. Since ∃AFl ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ Rl and (cid:2)AFi, AFj ∈ P such that (a, b) ∈ (Ri \ Rj ) ∪(Rj \ Ri), (a, b) /∈ Nk; so, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)k.The second part of the proof is obvious with a reductio ad absurdum: if we suppose that (cid:2)AFl ∈ P such that(a, b) ∈ Rl then we obtain ∀AFk ∈ P, (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12)k which is a contradiction with ∀AFk ∈ P, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)k. (cid:2)A notion of compatibility of a profile of PAFs over the same set of arguments can also be defined:S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753747Definition 32 (Compatibility). Let P = (cid:3)PAF1, . . . , PAFn(cid:4) be a profile of PAFs over a set of arguments A.PAF1, . . . , PAFn are said to be compatible if and only if they have at least one common completion. Otherwise theyare said to be incompatible.Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. Let exp be an expansion function. AF1, . . . , AFn are said to becompatible given exp if and only if exp(AFi, P), ∀i = 1 . . . n, are said to be compatible. Otherwise they are said tobe incompatible.There is a clear link between concordance and compatibility in the case of the consensual expansion applied toa profile of AFs:Proposition 33. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. P is concordant if and only if expC(AF1, P), . . . ,expC(AFn, P) are compatible.Proof. The first part of the proof is obvious: if P is concordant then the profile expC(P) = (cid:3)expC(AF1, P), . . . ,expC(AFn, P)(cid:4) is reduced to (cid:3)i AFi(cid:4) (see Proposition 29); so, expC(AF1, P), . . . , expC(AFn, P) areequal and have a common completion.i AFi, . . . ,(cid:2)(cid:2)The second part of the proof uses a reductio ad absurdum: if we suppose that P is discordant then ∃AFi, AFj suchj with N (cid:12)that ∃(a, b) ∈ Ri ∩ Nj ; so, (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12)jdenoting the non-attack relation of expC(AFj , P); so, all the completions of expC(AFi, P) must contain the attack(a, b) and no completion of expC(AFj , P) can contain the attack (a, b); so, AFi and AFj do not have a commoncompletion which is in contradiction with the hypothesis of compatibility. (cid:2)i denoting the attack relation of expC(AFi, P) and (a, b) ∈ N (cid:12)i with R(cid:12)Example 34. Consider the following argumentation systems AF1, AF2 and AF3.The completions of their respective consensual expansions PAF1, PAF2 and PAF3 are:AF1 and AF2 are discordant and incompatible given expC . AF3 and AF1 are concordant and compatible given expC .6.2. Properties of merging operatorsLet us now give some properties of merging operators, focusing on those based on the edit distance:Proposition 35. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs. Assume that the expansion function used for each agent(cid:2)is the consensual one. If P is concordant then (cid:2)⊗de(P) = {i AFi}.Proof. If P is concordant, then by Proposition 29, we have expC((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)) = (cid:3)(cid:2)⊗de((cid:3)mains to show that (cid:2)(cid:2)minimality requirement (i AFi, . . . ,i AFi is the unique PAF at edit distance 0 from itself). (cid:2)i AFi(cid:4). It re-i AFi}, which is obvious since de, as a distance, satisfies thei AFi(cid:4)) = {i AFi, . . . ,(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)Now we show an expected property: that the clash-free part of any profile P is included in each AF from themerging of P when the edit distance is used.748S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753Proposition 36. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of argumentation systems. Assume that the expansion func-tion used for each agent is the consensual one. For any aggregation function ⊗, we have that: ∀AF = (cid:3)A, R, N(cid:4) ∈(cid:2)⊗de((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)):• ACFP(P) ⊆ A,• RCFP(P) ⊆ R,• NCFP(P) ⊆ N .Proof. Let CFP(P) = (cid:3)ACFP, RCFP, NCFP(cid:4) (the ignorance relation does not appear here because argumentation sys-tems (and not partial ones) are considered).(cid:2)(cid:2)• ACFP =• By Proposition 25, we know that CFP(P) is pointwise included in each expC(AFi, P). Let first consider the casei Ai ⊆ A =i Ai .(a, b) ∈ RCFP, we have (a, b) ∈ RexpC (AFi ,P), ∀AFi .⊗Consider AF = (cid:3)A, R(cid:4) ∈ (cid:2)de((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)). Suppose that (a, b) /∈ R and consider AF{(a, b)}(cid:4).∀AFi , de(AFRexpC (AFi ,P); so, since ⊗ respects monotonicity, we have ⊗n⊗de((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)); so, (a, b) ∈ R. Hence RCFP(P) ⊆ R.we obtain a contradiction with AF ∈ (cid:2)(cid:12), expC(AFi, P)) = de(AF, expC(AFi, P)) − 1, since (a, b) ∈ R(cid:12) ∩ RexpC (AFi ,P) and /∈ R ∩i=1de(AF, expC(P)) andi=1de(AF(cid:12) = (cid:3)A(cid:12) = A, R(cid:12) = R ∪(cid:12), expC(P)) < ⊗n• In the same way, we can prove that if (a, b) ∈ NCFP then (a, b) ∈ N . So NCFP(P) ⊆ N . (cid:2)As a direct corollary of Propositions 23 and 36, we get that:Corollary 37. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of argumentation systems. Assume that the expansion functionused for each agent is the consensual one. For any aggregation function ⊗, we have that: ∀AF = (cid:3)A, R, N(cid:4) ∈(cid:2)⊗de((cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4)):• ACP(P) ⊆ A,• RCP(P) ⊆ R,• NCP(P) ⊆ N .When sum is used as the aggregation function and all AFs are over the same set of arguments, the merging ofa profile can be characterized in a concise way, thanks to the notion of majority graph. Intuitively the majority graphof a profile of AFs over the same set of arguments is the PAF obtained by applying the strict majority rule to decidewhether a attacks b or not, for every ordered pair (a, b) of arguments. Whenever there is no strict majority, anignorance edge is generated.Definition 38 (Majority PAF). Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs over the same set A of arguments. Themajority PAF MP(P) of P is the triple (cid:3)R, N, I (cid:4) such that ∀a, b ∈ A:4• (a, b) ∈ R if and only if #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ri}) > #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ni});• (a, b) ∈ N if and only if #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ni}) > #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ri});• (a, b) ∈ I otherwise.The next proposition states that, as expected, the majority PAF of a profile of AFs over the same set of argumentsis a PAF:Proposition 39. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs over the same set A of arguments. The majority PAFMP(P) of P is a PAF.4 For any set S, #(S) denotes the cardinality of S.S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753749Proof. Obvious since by construction, R and I are disjoint sets and N is the complement of R ∪ I into A × A. (cid:2)Example 40. Consider AF1 = (cid:3){a, b, c}, {(a, b), (b, c), (a, c)}(cid:4), AF2 = (cid:3){a, b, c}, {(a, b), (b, a), (a, c)}(cid:4).We have MP((cid:3)AF1, AF2(cid:4)) = (cid:3){a, b, c}, {(a, b), (a, c)}, {(b, c), (b, a)}, {(a, a), (b, b), (c, c), (c, a), (c, b)}(cid:4).Proposition 41. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs over the same set A of arguments. (cid:2)(cid:3)de(P) = C(MP(P)).Proof. The key is that the edit distance between an AF denoted by AF and a profile of AFs over A when (cid:3) is theaggregation operator is the sum over the AFi of the profile of the sum over every ordered pair of arguments over A ofthe edit distances between AF and AFi (this is a consequence of the associativity of the sum).(cid:9)Let AF be an AF over A which minimizesni=1 de(AF, AFi). Let a, b ∈ A. If #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ri}) > #({i ∈(cid:12) over A which coincides1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ni}), then (a, b) must be in the attack relation of AF; otherwise, the AF AF(cid:9)ni=1 de(AF, AFi).with AF except that (a, b) is in the attack relation of AFSimilarly, if #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ni}) > #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ri}), then (a, b) must not be in the attack relationof AF.(cid:12) would be such thatni=1 de(AF(cid:12), AFi) <(cid:9)In the remaining case, i.e., when #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ri}) = #({i ∈ 1 . . . n | (a, b) ∈ Ni}), let AFA which coincides with AF except that (a, b) is in the attack relation of AF(cid:12), AFi) =relation of AF. Then(cid:9)ni=1 de(AFThis shows that every AF over A which minimizesConversely, since every completion AF(cid:12) of MP(P) is such thatni=1 de(AF, AFi).(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)ni=1 de(AF, AFi) is a completion of the majority PAF MP(P).ni=1 de(AF, AFi) where AFni=1 de(AF(cid:12), AFi) =(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:12) be the AF over(cid:12) if and only if (a, b) is not in the attackminimizesni=1 de(AF, AFi), the conclusion follows. (cid:2)Let us illustrate the previous proposition on Example 7:Example 7 (continued). The consensual expansions of AF1, AF2 and AF3 are respectively:So, the majority PAF of (cid:3)AF1, AF2, AF3(cid:4) is:Using the edit distance and sum as the aggregation function, this PAF also represents the result of the merging in thesense that the latter is the set of all completions of this PAF.Computing the majority PAF of a profile of AFs over the same set of arguments amounts to voting on the attackrelations associated to each AF. As explained in Section 3, this can prove more suited to our goal than the approachwhich consists in voting directly on the acceptable sets of arguments for each agent. The previous proposition showsthat such a simple voting approach corresponds to a specific merging operator in our framework (but many otheroperators, especially arbitration ones, can also be used).750S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–7537. Acceptability for merged AFsStarting from a profile of AFs (over possibly different sets of arguments), a merging operator enables the compu-tation of a set of AFs (this time, over the same set of arguments) which are the best candidates to represent the AFs ofthe group (a kind of “consensus”).There is an important epistemic difference between those two sets of AFs, the first one reflects different points ofview given by different agents (and it can be the case that two distinct agents give the same AF), while the second setexpresses some uncertainty on the merging due to the presence of conflicts.Let us recall that the main goal of this paper is to characterize the sets of arguments acceptable by the whole groupof agents. In order to achieve it, it remains to define some mechanisms for exploiting the resulting set of AFs. Thiscalls for a notion of joint acceptability.Definition 42 (Joint acceptability). A joint acceptability relation for a profile (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) of AFs, denoted byi Ai with true if EAcc(cid:3)AF1,...,AFn(cid:4), is a total function from 2is a jointly acceptable set for (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) and with false otherwise.i Ai to {true, false} which associates each subset E of(cid:2)(cid:2)For instance, a joint acceptability relation for a profile (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) can be defined by the acceptability relationsAccAFi (based themselves on some semantics and some selection principles), which can coincide for every AFi (butthis is not mandatory) and a voting method V : {true, false}n (cid:19)→ {true, false}:Acc(cid:3)AF1,...,AFn(cid:4)(E) = V(cid:4)(cid:3)AccAF1(E), . . . , AccAFn(E).Here are some instances of Definition 42 based on voting methods:Definition 43 (Acceptabilities for profiles of AFs). Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of n AFs over the sameset of arguments A. Let AccAFi be the (local) acceptability relation associated with AFi . If n = 1, then we defineAcc(cid:3)AF1(cid:4) = AccAF1 . Otherwise, for any subset S of A, we say that:• S is skeptically jointly acceptable for P if and only if S is included in at least one acceptable set for each AFi :∀AFi ∈ P, ∃Ei such that AccAFi (Ei) is true and S ⊆ Ei.• S is credulously jointly acceptable for P if and only if S is included in at least one acceptable set for at least oneAFi :∃AFi ∈ P, ∃Ei such that AccAFi (Ei) is true and S ⊆ Ei.• S is jointly acceptable by majority for P if and only if S is included in at least one acceptable set for at leasta weak majority of AFi :(cid:3)(cid:13)#AFi | ∃Ei such that AccAFi (Ei) is true and S ⊆ Ei(cid:14)(cid:4)(cid:2) n2.Obviously enough, when none of the local acceptabilities AccAFi is trivial (i.e., equivalent to the constant functionfalse) for the profile under consideration, we have that any set of arguments which is skeptically jointly acceptableis also jointly acceptable by majority, and that any set of arguments which is jointly acceptable by majority is alsocredulously jointly acceptable.Note that skeptical (resp. credulous) joint acceptability does not require that the skeptical (resp. credulous) infer-ence principle is at work for defining local acceptabilities AccAFi , which remain unconstrained.Focusing on the preferred semantics together with credulous local acceptabilities, let us re-consider some previousexamples:Example 20 (continued). Using the edit distance and ⊗ = Leximax (or Max) as the aggregation function, we get(cid:12)two AFs AF1 and AF(cid:12)2 in the merging.If the local acceptability relations are based on credulous inference from preferred extensions, we have:S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753751• AccAF• AccAF(cid:12)1(cid:12)2(E) = true if and only if E ⊆ {c, d} or E ⊆ {b, e};(E) = true if and only if E ⊆ {a, c, e}.{c} and {e} are skeptically jointly acceptable and {b, e},{c, d} and {a, c, e} (and their subsets) are credulously (andby majority) jointly acceptable for the merging.Using this method, the argument a can still be derived credulously, contrariwise to what happens when the unionof the two AFs AF1 and AF2 is considered.Example 7 (continued). Using the edit distance and the sum as the aggregation function, we get one AF in the merging,denoted AF:AF has two preferred extensions: {a, c, e} and {b, d, e}. So, AccAF(E) = true if and only if E ⊆ {a, c, e} or E ⊆{b, d, e}. The three joint acceptability relations coincide here (as there is only one AF in the result). The sets {a, c, e}and {b, d, e} (and their subsets) are credulously, skeptically and by majority, jointly acceptable for the merging, whichis a more sensible result that the one obtained using a voting method on the derived arguments of the initial AFs (asexplained in Section 3).Example 14 (continued). Using the edit distance and the sum as the aggregation function, we get two AFs in themerging:The preferred extensions for these 2 AFs coincide (they are {a, c} and {b, d}). As the preferred extensions for the 2AFs are the same ones, the three relations of joint acceptability coincide here. Thus, the sets {a, c} and {b, d} (andtheir subsets) are skeptically, credulously and by majority jointly acceptable for the merging.It is interesting to compare the joint acceptability relation for the input profile P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) with the joint⊗d (P). Unsurprisingly, both predicates are not logically connected (i.e., noneacceptability relation for the merging (cid:2)of them implies the other one), even in the case when the two joint acceptability relations are based on the same notionof local acceptability (for instance, considering a set of arguments E as acceptable for an AF when it is included in atleast one of its preferred extensions) and the same voting method (for instance, the simple majority rule).Thus, it can be the case that new jointly acceptable sets are obtained after merging while they were not jointlyacceptable at start:Proposition 44. Let P = (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) be a profile of AFs over the same set of arguments A. The set of all jointlyacceptable sets for the profile P is not necessarily equal to the set of all jointly acceptable sets for the merging of P.A counter-example is given by Example 14.When each local acceptability relation corresponds exactly to the collective acceptability proposed by Dung (fora given semantics and ∀AFi , AccAFi (E) = true if and only if E is an extension of AFi for this semantics), the followingremarks can be done:• If a set of arguments is included in one of the acceptable sets for an agent, it is not necessarily included into oneof the acceptable sets of any AF from the merging (and it also holds for singletons). The converse is also true.• More surprisingly, even if a set of arguments is included into each acceptable set for an agent, it is not guaranteedto be included into an acceptable set of an AF from the merging. Conversely, if a set of arguments is includedinto every acceptable set of the AFs from the merging, it is not guaranteed to be included into an acceptable set752S. Coste-Marquis et al. / Artificial Intelligence 171 (2007) 730–753for one of the agents. Intuitively, this can be explained by the fact that if an argument is accepted by all agents forbad reasons (for instance, because they lack information about attacks on it), it can be rejected by the group afterthe merging. More formally, this is due to the fact that nothing ensures that one of the initial AFs will belong tothe result of the merging and also to the fact that acceptability is non-monotonic (in the sense that adding a singleattack (a, b) in an AF may drastically change its extensions).8. Conclusion and perspectivesWe have presented a framework for deriving sensible information from a collection of argumentation systems à laDung. Our approach consists in merging such systems. The proposed framework is general enough to allow for therepresentation of many different scenarios. It is not assumed that all agents must share the same sets of arguments.No assumption is made concerning the meaning of the attack relations, so that such relations may differ not onlybecause agents have different points of view on the way arguments interact but more generally may disagree onwhat an interaction is. Each agent may be associated to a specific expansion function, which enables for encodingmany attitudes when facing a new argument. Many different distances between PAFs and many different aggregationfunctions can be used to define argumentation systems which best represent the whole group.By means of example, we have shown that our merging-based approach leads to results which are much moreexpected than those furnished by a direct vote on the (sets of) arguments acceptable by each agent. We have alsoshown that union cannot be taken as a valuable merging operator in the general case. We have investigated formallysome properties of the merging operators which we point out. Among other results, we have shown that mergingoperators based on the edit distance preserve all the information on which all the agents participating in the merg-ing process agree, and more generally, all the information on which the agents participating in the merging processdo not disagree. We have also shown that the merging operator based on the edit distance and the sum as aggre-gation function is closely related to the merging approach which consists in voting on the attack relations whenthe input profile gathers argumentation systems over the same set of arguments. Finally, we have proven that in thegeneral case, the derivable sets of arguments when joint acceptability concerns the input profile may drastically dif-fer from the derivable sets of arguments when joint acceptability concerns the profile obtained after the mergingstep.We plan to refine our framework in several directions.Merging PAFs. Our framework can be extended to PAFs merging (instead of AFs). This enables us to take intoaccount agents with incomplete belief states regarding the attack relation between arguments. Expansions of PAFscan be defined in a very similar way to expansions of AFs (what mainly changes is the way ignorance is handled). AsPAFs are more expressive than AFs, an interesting issue for further research is to define acceptability for PAFs.Attacks strengths. Assume that each attack believed by Agent i is associated to a numerical value reflecting thestrength of the attack according to the agent, i.e., the degree to which Agent i believes that a attacks b. It is easyto take into account those values by modifying slightly the definition of the edit distance over an ordered pair ofarguments (for instance, viewing such values as weights once normalized within [0, 1]). Another possibility regardingattack strengths is, from unweighted attack relations, to generate a weighted one, representing different degrees ofaccordance in the group. For instance, each attack (a, b) in the majority PAF of a profile (cid:3)AF1, . . . , AFn(cid:4) can belabeled by the ratio #({i∈1...n|(a,b)∈Ri })and similarly for the non-attack relation (this leads to consider both the attackand the non-attack relations of the majority PAF as fuzzy relations). Corresponding acceptability relations remain tobe defined. This is another perspective of this work.nMerging audiences. In [7], an extension of the notion of AF, called valued AF—VAF for short—has been proposedin order to take advantage of values representing the agent’s preferences in the context of a given audience. A furtherperspective of our work concerns the merging of such VAFs.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.
