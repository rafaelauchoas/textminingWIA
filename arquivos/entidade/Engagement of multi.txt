Method: A cross-sectional census study in which the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale was used to identify the level of relationship with work (Total score) through 17 questions distributed in the Vigor, Dedication and Absorption dimensions. Results: Participation of 50 professionals, of which 92.0% were female, median age of 24 years, 88.0% were single; 82.0% were satisfied with the program, and 56.0% had thought of giving up. Professionals satisfied with the program had high levels for Total Score (4.0) and Dedication (4.5), and average levels for Absorption (3.9) and Vigor (3.8). Those who reported dissatisfaction had average levels in all dimensions (Vigor: 3.2, Absorption: 3.5, Dedication: 3.5) and in the Total score (3.2), which are considered positive results. Conclusion: Professionals presented good levels of engagement in spite of dissatisfactions with the program. The results showed a good relationship between professionals and preceptors and supervisors, which reinforces that support and recognition of professional performance are important for strengthening the engagement, especially at the beginning of the career.DESCRIPTORSWork Engagement; Internship and Residency; Health Human Resource Training; Interprofessional Relations; Occupational Health.Corresponding author:Luciano Garcia LourençãoUniversidade Federal do Rio GrandeEscola de EnfermagemRua General Osório, s/nº, 4º piso, Centro, Campus da SaúdeCEP 96201-900 – Rio Grande, RS, Brazil luciano.famerp@gmail.comReceived: 02/06/2018Approved: 09/05/2018Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2019;53:e034371www.ee.usp.br/reeuspEngagement of multi-professional residents in healthINTRODUCTIONThe multi-professional health residency programs insti-tuted in 2005 are post-graduation specialization courses (named lato sensu in Brazil) directed to health professions with the exception of medicine. The multi-professional residency is aimed at in-service education, guided by the principles and guidelines of the Unified Health System, and seeks the qualification of young professionals for meeting local and regional demands and realities(1).Although multi-professional residency is one of the best forms of professional qualification in the health area, the residence training is a period of much physical and emotional exhaustion for professionals(2). Factors such as the exclusive dedication required by legislation(1), and the insecurity, fear and pressure felt by newly graduated professionals generate uncertainty, anxiety and disil-lusionment that hinder the development of skills and abilities, and consequently compromise professional performance(2). Regardless of the great demands of work and the phys-ical and emotional exhaustion inherent to the in-service training process in the multi-professional residency, some professionals do not show symptoms of exhaustion and, conversely, demonstrate pleasure through hard work and its demands. These professionals are described as engaged, i.e. engaged in their work(3-4).The concept of engagement is recent, linked to posi-tive psychology and has been associated with several con-structs, but differs from other psychological states such as workaholism and job satisfaction. Engagement expresses activation (enthusiasm, attention, excitement, euphoria), and satisfaction implies satiation (contentment, calmness, serenity, relaxation). While engaged professionals see work as challenging and fun, workaholics feel a compulsive inner drive they cannot resist(3-5).In this context, engagement is an independent construct defined as a positive, satisfactory and work-related state of mind involving the professional’s commitment and align-ment with the environment and work activity. It is an affec-tive, persistent and comprehensive cognitive state of motiva-tional and social nature characterized by three dimensions, namely: Vigor, Absorption and Dedication(3-5).Vigor is defined by high levels of energy and mental resilience, desire to invest efforts at work and persistence to overcome difficulties. Dedication refers to being strongly involved and enthusiastic about work with feelings of sig-nificance, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption cor-responds to concentration with pleasure, so that time passes quickly, and the worker has difficulty with disconnecting from work(4-5).It is observed that “although there is no specific set for developing engagement, some factors found in the litera-ture are associated with the concept, such as: social support; work performance; personal resources (such as self-efficacy and self-esteem); positive psychological capital; beliefs; type of coping used; optimism; organizational resources and demands; customer satisfaction and resilience”(6).2Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2019;53:e03437Given the shortage of epidemiological studies on engagement, the development of studies on this theme is relevant for obtaining normative scores that can be used as national or specific references of groups of workers, and for comparisons with individual or group engagement outcomes. Thus, professional categories, teams, departments or groups of professionals can be classified in levels of engagement varying from very low to very high(5).In Brazil, although studies on engagement with health professionals are recent, they showed satisfactory results, especially in the dedication dimension, and a positive rela-tionship between professionals and work(7-8). For some authors, studies on engagement may contribute to under-standing the aspects related to the development of this con-struct and favor the organization and improvement of work processes in health services(7-10).In this context, studying engagement with multi-profes-sional residents in health can identify strengths and weak-nesses in the relationship of professionals with the train-ing environment, thereby contributing to strengthening these programs and improving professional training for the Brazilian health system.In view of the above, the aim of this study was to evalu-ate the levels of engagement in the work of professionals enrolled in multi-professional health residency programs of a public institution in the inland of the state of São Paulo.METHODType of sTudyCross-sectional census study.scenarioPerformed with professionals from different areas, enrolled in multi-professional health residency programs of a public institution in the inland of the state of São Paulo.The study population included all professionals enrolled in multi-professional health residency programs offered by the institution, who agreed to participate in the study after being informed about its objectives and purposes, totaling 50 professionals.daTa collecTionData were collected from November 2013 to February 2014 with use of two self-applied instruments. The first one was prepared by the authors for characterization of profession-als’ profile, and contained personal data, such as professional category, gender, age, marital status, family income, if the per-son is satisfied and has already thought about giving up the program. The second was the Brazilian version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) validated by Vazques et al.(11), which allows the identification of the level of relation-ship with work (Total score) by means of 17 questions dis-tributed in the dimensions of Vigor (high levels of energy and resistance, desire to invest effort, not feeling fatigued easily, and persistence in the face of difficulties), Dedication (sense of meaning of work, feeling enthusiastic and proud about the job and inspired and challenged by it) and Absorption www.ee.usp.br/reeusp(being totally and happily immersed at work, having difficul-ties detaching from it, so that time passes quickly and the professional forgets everything that is around)(11-12).The consistency of data was evaluated by Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient. The calculations of scores of engage-ment dimensions were performed according to the statis-tical model proposed in the UWES Preliminary Manual. Minimum, maximum, median, mean (± standard devia-tion) values were presented, and 95% confidence intervals were set for each UWES dimension. After calculating the scores of each dimension, the values obtained were inter-preted according to the decoding of the UWES Preliminary Manual(12), in which 0 to 0.99 = Very Low; 1 to 1.99 = Low; 2 to 3.99 = Average; 4 to 4.99 = High; 5 to 6 = Very High. analysis and processing of daTaData analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 17.0. For the compari-sons of mean scores of the UWES dimensions, the F-test was used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) by considering a significance level of 5% (p <0.05).eThical aspecTsThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculdade de Medicina de São José do Rio Preto (FAMERP) under number 460.331 from 11/12/2013, and were respected the ethical precepts of research involv-ing human beings as established by Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council. All participants signed the Informed Consent form.Rotta DS, Lourenção LG, Gonsalez EG, Teixeira PR, Gazetta CE, Pinto MHRESULTSFifty professionals from different categories participated in the study, and most were nurses (30.0%). There was a prevalence of the female gender (92.0%), the age range var-ied from 20 to 30 years, and the median age was 24 years. Regarding marital status, 88.0% of respondents were single. Twenty-eight professionals (56.0%) had family income of 2 to 5 minimum wages and nine (18.0%), above 10 minimum wages. Forty-one (82.0%) professionals reported they were satisfied with the program, although 28 (56.0%) had already considered giving up (Table 1).Table 2 presents the results of the engagement evaluation from the distribution of minimum, maximum, median, mean values (± standard deviation) and 95% confidence inter-vals according to the UWES dimensions. The mean of the total score was 3.9 (±1.0) points, classified as average. The Dedication dimension had a high score with a mean of 4.3 (±1.2) points.As observed in Table 3, Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient ranged from 0.788 to 0.938, indicating the reliability of results. The distribution of the number of professionals at each level of engagement classification showed that in the Vigor dimension, 46.9% (n=23) of professionals presented high or very high levels of engagement; in the Absorption dimension, 50.0% (n=25) of professionals had high or very high engagement levels; and in the Dedication dimension, these levels were found in 66.0% (n=33) of professionals. For the Total score, the average level was observed in 44.9% (n=22) of professionals, while 53.0% (n=26) had high or very high levels.Table 1 – Sociodemographic characteristics of professionals studied – São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, 2014.Professional categoryGenderAge groupMarital statusFamily income(minimum wage)*Satisfied with programThought of giving up the programNursingPharmacyPhysiotherapyBiological SciencesDentistrySpeech-language PathologyNutritionPsychologyVeterinary MedicineOccupational TherapyMaleFemale20 - 25 years26 - 30 yearsNo answerMarriedSingleOthers2 to 56 to 10More than 10YesNoYesNo*Minimum wage value at the time of data collection: R$ 678.00.n1502050202030904010744638100205440128130941092822%30.04.010.04.04.06.018.08.02.014.08.092.076.020.04.010.088.02.056.026.018.082.018.056.044.0Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2019;53:e034373www.ee.usp.br/reeuspEngagement of multi-professional residents in healthTable 2 – Evaluation of engagement according to dimensions of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale – São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, 2014.UWES scores*VigorAbsorptionDedicationTotal scoren49494949†Min‡Max§MdMean (±sd| |)CI (95%)¶InterpretationP-value0.31.00.40.65.55.36.05.43.83.84.64.13.7±1.03.8±1.04.3±1.23.9±1.03.4 – 4.03.5 – 4.13.9 – 4.63.6 – 4.2AverageAverageHighAverage0.1180.0830.0470.110*UWES: Utrecht Work Engagement Scale; †Min.: minimum; ‡Max.: maximum; §Md: median; ||SD: standard deviation; ¶CI 95%: 95% confidence interval.Table 3 – Classification of the level of engagement of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale dimensions – São José do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, 2014.UWES dimensions*nCronbach’s alphaMean scoreVery lowLowAverageHighVery highClassification of level of engagement at workVigorAbsorptionDedicationTotal score495050490.8360.7880.9120.9383.83.84.64.1*UWES: Utrecht Work Engagement Scale.n01-0101%2.0-2.02.0n0101--%2.02.0--n24241622%49.048.032.044.9n18181320%36.736.026.040.8n05072006%10.214.040.012.2The evaluation of engagement according to professional categories (Table 4), showed that residents of Physical Therapy and Nutrition presented high scores (high or very high) in all dimensions of the UWES.

The prevalence of nursing professionals is consistent with that found in other in-service training programs(2,8,16) and inherent to the distribution of the number of vacancies offered by the study institution for different professional categories. Of the 50 vacancies offered annually, 18 are des-tined for different nursing specialties(8,17).The levels of engagement presented by multi-profes-sional residents of this study are similar to those found in Brazilian studies with pediatric medical residents(7) and with professionals of improvement programs(8), which shows pro-fessionals’ commitment and positive alignment with the work environment.The high level of Dedication presented by multi-pro-fessional residents is a strong point in the relationship of these professionals with the training environment, and shows their involvement and enthusiasm with work, as mentioned in other studies(7-8,10,15). The presence of highly dedicated professionals in multi-professional residency programs can be explained by the quality of the service, the professional qualification process, and the rigorous selection process that includes objective evidence, curricular analysis and interview for filling the 50 vacancies offered annually.According to the literature, engagement is a relatively stable phenomenon that can be explained by the presence of specific organizational and work characteristics(18). This construct is not focused on a single objective, event or situ-ation, but characterized by energy, involvement and profes-sional effectiveness, which are beneficial to workers, i.e., lead to well-being, since working motivated by factors or core values is quite satisfactory(13). In this context, professionals with high levels of engagement will contribute positively to the care provided to health services users.Mean±sd†InterpretationP-value3.8±1.13.2±0.13.9±1.03.5±0.94.5±1.13.6±1.04.0±1.03.2±0.6Mean±sd†3.2±1.04.3±0.63.3±1.04.4±0.63.7±1.25.0±0.73.4±1.04.6±0.6AverageAverageAverageAverageHighAverageHighAverageInterpretationAverageHighAverageHighAverageVery highAverageHigh0.0510.2350.0080.008P-value<0.001<0.001<0.001<0.001Although the literature highlights the stressful nature of professional residency programs that make adaption and professional performance difficult(2,19-20), this study demon-strated that most professionals have high or very high levels of engagement, especially in Dedication and Absorption dimen-sions, that is, they have a positive relationship with work (Total score), concentration (Absorption) and involvement (Dedication ) with the work activity. These results confirm those found among Saudi(14) and Irish nurses(15) by reinforcing that engagement is influenced by organizational variables and engaged workers tend to be healthier and more efficient(21).Recent studies have shown that involvement at work can vary from person to person, and professionals may show higher or lower levels of engagement in day to day depending on what happens on that particular day(18,22). Furthermore, profession-als with high levels of engagement can cope better with work demands as they have energy, are connected to work, and feel able to deal with the less positive aspects of the work activity(23).However, engagement is not just an individual phenom-enon, but related to the group in which the worker is inserted. Workers of some teams or parts of an organization may be more engaged than others(5,22), as shown by a study with Portuguese nurses from hospital units, who presented average and high levels of engagement varying between regions, hospitals and care units(24). These data corroborate the results observed in this study among the different professional categories of residents.The prevalence of professionals satisfied with the multi-professional residency program was an evident positive factor in this study. These professionals had significantly higher levels of engagement than dissatisfied professionals, especially in the Dedication dimension. According to the literature, the valoriza-tion of workers’ performance and creativity by their superiors and the financial aspect can be associated to satisfaction and well-being at work(25), and contribute to higher engagement. For the multi-professional residents studied, the remuneration received at the beginning of the career and professional recogni-tion may be reasons for the mentioned satisfaction.Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2019;53:e034375www.ee.usp.br/reeuspEngagement of multi-professional residents in healthEngagement is proportionately related to performance at work and is structured as professionals like or dislike their work(26). Studies with health and education professionals show high mean values in all dimensions (Vigor, Dedication and Absorption) of the UWES, which demonstrates that professionals’ satisfaction with work is significant and posi-tively related to the levels of engagement(14,27-28).Significantly higher engagement levels presented by pro-fessionals who never thought about giving up the program confirm the literature that points positive work involvement as an important factor for the workforce worldwide, and its absence can cause great emotional exhaustion. High engage-ment is associated with success factors, such as increased worker performance and efficiency, higher productivity, safety, customer service and professional retention, customer satisfaction and loyalty, and profitability(22).In addition, engaged workers are healthier, experience positive emotions more often, create their work resources and can pass on their commitment to others(26).Organizational strategies that promote a cohesive and healthy work environment with reduction of stress related to care practice, professional recognition, supportive relation-ships, good communication, teamwork and positive experi-ences with teachers and preceptors can guarantee multi-professional residents’ satisfaction, improve their levels of Vigor (energy and resilience), Absorption (concentration) and Dedication (involvement and enthusiasm)(29).Therefore, by meeting the needs of young professionals who enter multi-professional residency programs, it is pos-sible to stimulate a higher engagement(9) and contribute to professionals’ better qualification for serving health services users at the end of the training process.RESUMOThe main limitations of this study were the lack of other studies on engagement with health professionals and the sample restricted to a single educational institution. These factors highlight the need to broaden the scientific research related to the subject with a greater number of profession-als and institutions by deepening the analysis between the different professional categories and their labor specificities, and contributing to the knowledge on engagement among multi-professional residents in health. Moreover, in order to make the evaluation of engagement among residents more effective, the causes of dissatisfaction mentioned by profes-sionals must be investigated.CONCLUSIONThe study showed that multi-professional residents pre-sented good levels of engagement, in spite of dissatisfactions with the program. The results showed a good relationship between professionals and preceptors and supervisors, which reinforces that support and recognition of professional per-formance are important for strengthening of engagement, especially in the beginning of the career.Professionals’ satisfaction and their levels of engagement can be improved through changes in the work environment with professional valorization and collaboration, greater autonomy of the resident, support and integration with teachers and preceptors that facilitate the work process and make it more participatory, thereby improving performance, productivity and quality in community service.Finally, when professionals with high levels of engage-ment exercise their work activities, they will contribute to improvement of patient safety, quality of care, and better service performance.Objetivo: Avaliar os níveis de engagement de residentes multiprofissionais em saúde de uma instituição de ensino superior do noroeste paulista.
