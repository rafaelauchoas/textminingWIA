Methods: the research consisted of two parts: the participant observation technique wasused by health professionals to translate the platform; with an approach in the service withonline forms for pregnant women, and the content analysis was performed by groundedtheory of the data. During five months, 109 pregnant women and mothers installed the app,but only 17 completed the questionnaire. Results: the women and health professionals pointed out questions such as interactivity,application interface, content,  pregnancy and childcare clinical management, whichcontributed for the Brazilian version. Conclusions: the participatory medicine and e-pregnant woman are new premises of ahumanization policy for women and childcare. The insertion of an app with information basedon the best evidence in the prenatal routine in the health establishments with teaching activi-ties that can provide new dialogue connections with the pregnant women and chances toupdate the professional in training.Key words Woman's health, Child health, Maternal mortality, TelemedicineThis article is published in Open Access under the Creative Commons Attributionhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1806-93042019000400002license, which allows use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, withoutrestrictions, as long as the original work is correctly cited.Rev.

According the World Healthto Organization (WHO) in 2010 there were approxi-mately 287 thousand deaths, the majority wereavoidable and in developing countries. This problemhas so many causal factors that the United Nations(UN) Millennium Development Goals concluded in2015 did not succeed in reducing this rate by 75% inthe world, including Brazil.1The differences between impoverished andwealthy regions are abyssal. Whereas in developingcountries in 100 thousand live births 239 women die,in developed countries this number reduced to 12women. Therefore, one of the goals of the ThirdSustainable Development Goals called “Health withquality” (from 2016 to 2030), is to reduce thematernal mortality rate to less than 70 per 100 thou-sand births worldwide and no other country shouldhave a maternal mortality rate more than the doubleof the global average.2In Brazil, there are many underreporting pro-blems that hinder consensus on an exact number. Ina 2002 survey, the maternal mortality rate was esti-mated at 54.3 on a set of Brazilian State Capitals.After adjustment and refining, the maternal mortalityin the country in 2011 was 64.8 and was still above64 in 2017.3Women who survive severe complications ofpregnancy, childbirth and postpartum have much incommon with those who have died of these samecomplications.4 This similarity led to the develop-ment of the concept of maternal near miss, definedby WHO as “a woman who nearly died but surviveda complication that occurred during pregnancy,childbirth or within 42 days of pregnancy termina-tion” that became a way to verify the quality ofprenatal care.5Although we are living in an information society,connected by networks, the lack of information toprevent pregnancy complications contributes todeaths resulting from childbirth, postpartum andabortions.6 The excess of information with noquality verification, which has multiplied since theemergence of the internet, also aggravates the situa-tion.7Interventions on digital health8 have been arisingthroughout the world to address the widespreadmisinformation related to reproductive health.Quality certified entities on health information fromwebsites, international guidelines in how to designand evaluate cell phone apps are available formanagers, the academic community and the popula-The Zero Mothers Die (ZMD)10 project consistsof a global collaboration to save pregnant womenand their babies’ lives by spreading technologies toimprove its access to healthy pregnancy and first aidinformation. It is a multilateral public-private part-nership with adherence in African countries, withUNAIDS, telecommunication companies and otherskey actors.Among these partnership products there is theZMD app for smartphones, available for free inEnglish and French for Android platforms. It is adigital health initiative on the m-health modalityaimed for pregnant women, mothers with zero to oneyear old children and health professionals, in whichthe main goal is to reduce maternal mortalitythroughout the world, providing key-information tothese interlocutors about health care. The appconsists of a section divided into weeks to accom-pany the pregnancy and another part divided intomonths to monitor child development in the firstyear of life. There is also a section aimed for primarycare health professionals with audiovisual resourcesfor continuing education.The care centered for patient , a practice adoptedin various health systems, assumes its discourse willalso reach caregivers and family members,11 whichrequires participative methodology to qualify thecare. On the other hand, the connected patient reactsin a different way, interacting with the digitalecosystem, as what has been termed the e-patient.12In Brazil, this care centered practice related to preg-nant woman and child in the early years of life hasachieved in many policies and strategies, in parti-cular, humanization and integral care on prevalentchildhood diseases. Considering the present scenario, this studydescribes the adaptation process of the ZMD appinto the Brazilian context, with the methodology ofindividualized auscultation for pregnant womenusers at a high complexity referred teaching hospitalMethodsThis is a descriptive study of an exploratory naturethat has adapted a digital intervention for a publichealth problem for the Brazilian interlocutor. Sinceethnographic research has been used to observe aspecific social scenario and processes that arecomposed of multiple and changing elements,13 thecurrent investigation was made on a qualitativenature using an ethnographic research techniquecalled the participatory observation to translate theplatform by health professionals.752Rev. Bras. Saúde Mater. Infant., Recife, 19 (4): 751-762 out-dez., 2019Cross cultural adaptation of Zero Mothers Die app in BrazilThe research scenario was at the InstitutoNacional de Saúde da Mulher, da Criança e doAdolescente Fernandes Figueira(FernandesFigueira National Institute of Woman, Child andAdolescent Health), a public reference hospital ofmedium and high complexity for high fetal risk preg-nancies and for children with chronic complexconditions. It is a technical scientific unit of the(Oswaldo CruzFundação Oswaldo CruzFoundation) teaching hospital located in Rio deJaneiro, Brazil, whose 2018 structure comprised 12beds for pregnant women, 14 beds for accommoda-tion and three rooms of pre-childbirth, childbirth andimmediate postpartum .At the first stage of the research, a bibliographicreview was made, combined with live and virtualmeetings with a specialist multitask group. Studentsof the medical residency programs, nursing andmultidisciplinary as well as other areas involved inthe programs were sensitized and recruited at thesame hospital. They composed an on demand multi-disciplinary group for translation and technical revi-sion monitored by the research team and theirpreceptors.The research group was composed of thirteenresearchers, namely: a pharmacist, a food engineer, aphysiotherapist, a pediatrician, an obstetrician, apediatric surgeon, a psychologist, a journalist, andnursing and health worker residents. Among themthere were five PhD professionals, one doctoralcandidate, and six were acting as preceptors in theresidency courses at the hospital. There was a Frenchnative speaker which allowed the group to comparethe English and French app versions.The translation was done based on consensusassessment methodology among the specialists andconcluded with a re-translation activity,14 registeredin field diaries. Throughout the cross-cultural adap-tation alterations were made with multiple tools inthe healthcare field,15 involving translation, re-trans-lation, technical revision and semantic evaluation,content validation by professionals in the area, toolassessment by a sample of the target population, bymeans of evaluating comprehension levels.In the second part of the research, we intend topresent the initial profile of this e-pregnant woman,the informational needs for the quality of life for thewoman and her baby. Pregnant women, usersof theprenatal services and of the human milk bank wereapproached by professionals at these services tovolunteer to install the app on the pregnant women’ssmartphones and later contacted them to fill out theonline evaluation form. As exclusion criteria, theoption was not to approach women with severe fetalmalformation, whose outpatient service is done in adifferent way and on specific days. The investigation was performed betweenNovember 2017 and December 2018 and had sevenstages as demonstrated below:1. Translation of the material performed by aprofessional.2. Revision and adaptation performed by amultidisciplinary team.3. Submission of the originals to the ZMD teamin Europe to review and to integrate the content withthe app.4. Publication and release of the BrazilianPortuguese version at the Google store.5. Recruitment of pregnant women at prenataland pediatric clinics and the human milk bank.6. WhatsApp contact and individual fill outsurvey.7. Analysis of the responses of the surveyThe approach with the pregnant women had atheoretical reference based on the Grounded TheoryData (GTD). According to GTD, the data werecollected and analyzed concomitantly in a circularmovement, aimed at theoretical saturation and veri-fying the investigated hypothesis.16 The sample ofprenatal service volunteers was non-probabilistic,which reinforces this reference, that works with theconcept of theoretical sampling,17 and refers to thepossibility of the researcher to seek their data in thetestimony of people who were indicated of havingthe knowledge about the reality to be investigated. Data collection took five months and was led bya data capturing team. In terms of the approach, theteam started with a simple explanation of the ZMDapp. The team explained how to download the appon the Android smartphones. Afterwards, theyinvited the pregnant women and mothers’ groupduring the lecture activities on prenatal care, post-partum or feeding at the human milk bank by partici-pating in the assessment research.The same procedure was used by the datacapture team in approaching individuals in outpa-tient care. The women who were willing to joinsigned a consent form, received a leaflet with addi-tional explanations in how to fill out the online form(see Appendix I), gave their personal email andWhatsApp contact.After a week, the research team sent the formlink again by WhatsApp. The content of the ques-tionnaire was based on the e-health literacy scale(eHEALS)18 and its configuration was done inonline research software where the attendeesrecorded their app experience (See Appendix II).eHEALS is designed to assess users' perceivedRev. Bras. Saúde Mater. Infant., Recife, 19 (4): 751-762 out-dez., 2019753Silva AB et al.competencies in the use of health information tech-nology and to help determine the suitability of appli-cations for public health programs. Afterwards, acontent analysis was made from the WhatsApp chatsand filled out forms and grouping codes. The onlinecontacts and forms registered impressions, opinionsand reports on pregnant women and mothers aboutthe usage of the app.This research was submitted to Plataforma Brasilunder CAAE number 85439418.8.8.0000.5269 andapproved by the Ethics Committee number3.005.922.ResultsThe health professionals held fifteen face-to-facemeetings and facilitated a virtual discussion groupbetween October 2017 and November 2018.Activities and observations were registered inmeeting minutes and online chats were filed in theapp. Alterations recommended by health profes-sionalsA first finding was that the app when simulating aconversation with a pregnant woman and in earlymaternity, had addressed the same content, but withdifferent narratives, in both languages. In this sense,the research group made four changes that werehighlighted as the guidelines in care in the countrywere compared to the international recommenda-tions.1. Procedure of umbilical cord clamping in emergency childbirth and prematurity In the text related to the seventh month of preg-nancy, the app raises the subject of early emergencychildbirth. Besides modifying the cold, direct andsynthetic language so as not to alarm the pregnantwoman for no reason, we added in the app that if itoccurred the baby would be considered prematureand would need special care. Giving clear instruc-tions about umbilical cord clamping for the woman,a midwife or a layperson was an overall groupconcern.In Aristotle19 studies had already pointed out thatwaiting for a few minutes until the cessation of theumbilical cord pulse, before clamping it, it wouldimprove the future health of the baby. The reason isthat the additional blood volume gained by this prac-tice may benefit the development of the newborn,especially among premature babies born before the37th week of pregnancy.of Obstetricians Considering the benefits of most newborns, theAmerican College andGynecologists20 now recommend the delay of umbi-lical cord clamping on full-term and prematurebabies, for at least 30-60 seconds after birth, exceptif there is any contraindication related to the umbi-lical cord or the need for neonatal resuscitation.After many discussions, the final text waswritten as below:"Put the baby stomach up between the mother’s legs. Waituntil the cord pulse ceases. Afterwards, tie two cleanstrings or laces around the cord. The first knot should bemade a thumb-length from the baby’s belly. The secondknot should be three finger widths distant from the first.Tighten the knots. Cut the cord between the two knots."2. HIV positive breastfeedingThe WHO and United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF), recommend that in poor countries thebenefits of exclusive breastfeeding must be consid-ered in regard to virus transmission risk,21 takinginto account that breastfeeding considerablycontributes to reduce child morbimortality rates fromdiseases like diarrhea, respiratory diseases andmalnutrition. Included in this context, breastfeedingis exclusive until six months old and supplementeduntil two years of age or more to babies of HIV posi-tive mothers, as long as the mother has been underantiretroviral therapy (ART). The viral load on the mother’s milk is one of themajor causes of vertical transmission of HIV,because the viral particles are freely excreted by themilk monocytes of the infected woman, regardlessof whether or not she presents with symptoms, andare transmitted to the baby by the nasopharyngealmucosa and gastrointestinal tract, which as it is stillmaturing, is a virus entry point.22Antiretroviral treatment (ART) during pregnancyand postpartum by HIV positive women reducevertical virus transmission. However, it is importantto highlight that this therapy does not control theelimination of HIV-1 in mother’s milk. Therefore,there is a consensus in Brazil – Ministry of Health23– that breastfeeding should be contraindicated.24Other reasons associated with this consensus arerelated to late diagnosis and insufficient adherenceto treatment.25For this reason, the team chose to write in theapp a translated text about breastfeeding planningreferring to the second semester, its contraindicationfor HIV positive pregnant women:754Rev. Bras. Saúde Mater. Infant., Recife, 19 (4): 751-762 out-dez., 2019Cross cultural adaptation of Zero Mothers Die app in Brazil“If you are HIV positive, you may talk to your physicianabout how to breastfeed your baby without transmittingthe virus. He/she will guide you.”3. Tuberculosis transmission by mother, family members and lactating women In the twelfth week of pregnancy, the team addedbesides caring for a pregnant woman with tubercu-losis, it is also important to observe respiratorysymptoms in the family members and seek tubercu-losis testing at a health unit as well as mentioningthat this treatment is available for free in the SistemaÚnico de Saúde (SUS). (Public Health) units inBrazil. We corrected the withdrawal time for tubercu-losis transmission prevention measures from two to15 days, according to the recommendations of theMinistry of Health in Brazil. It was observed in theliterature26 that a patient is considered non-infec-tious if they have no previous tuberculosis treatmenthistory, nor another known risk of drug resistance, inwhich after 15 days of treatment it will present aclinical improvement. However, based on theevidences of drug resistant tuberculosis transmis-sion, the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommendsthat consideration should be given to obtain a nega-tive bacilloscopy so that precautions with contagionshould be suspended.4. Mother and baby always included in thediscourse At the first meetings with the multidisciplinaryteam of professionals involved in the research, thefact that the app focused on the health of the preg-nant woman, mother and baby was highlighted, anddespite have included in the content very importantaspects about the health of the pregnant woman,mother and baby, it did not include a slightly more'inclusive' welcome on healthcare for the main inter-locutor and user of the app, which is, the mother.Although the original texts in the app bringaspects related to the mother’s healthcare, theyalways had a final appeal, albeit with an “implicit”intention to be addressed to the mother, the mainemphasis was on the concern the mother should haveabout her baby’s health, when at the end of eachpregnancy week the text emphasized:“If this week you want to do something good for yourbaby…".Although a priorithis detail sound trivial,considering the psychic and emotional aspects of apregnant woman, it is important to stress throughoutthe texts that the concern is mainly about her health,calling on her for co-participation and responsibilityfor her self-care, as a form of early intervention notonly on her physical but also her mental health. Therefore, as the mother is mentioned in thespeech that is directed to her, and at all times‘perceives’ and sees herself as truly important andessential at that moment, she will feel welcomed as aparticipant in the pregnancy, realizing how impor-tant it is that not only the baby is well, but especiallythat she is well, thus gradually urging her toapproach and concern herself with her wellbeing andthat of the other who lives in her, and thus enabling,through reading the dialogues and instructions givenby the app, which although 'implicitly' and mini-mally, will generate the first bonds between her andher baby.Thus, after reflections about this aspect’s impor-tance, this is how the final text was constructed:“If this week you want to do something good for you andyour baby…””Pregnant woman and mother’s profileAt the hospital 109 pregnant women wereapproached between September and November2018. All of them received the information leafletwith the form link as well as the instructions aboutthe app, which was downloaded and installed ontheir smartphones with the assistance from the datagathering team. After seven days they werecontacted by WhatsApp in order to respond theonline form about their app usage. The list of questions was filled out by 17 users,14 pregnant women and three new mothers. Threewomen decided not to identify themselves.The pregnant women answered seven closed andone open question. They also provided age andschooling information. The woman’s mean age was34 years old, varying between 21 and 44 years old.All the twelve women who informed their schoolinghad nine years of basic schooling and nine of themdeclared being undergraduates.In terms of the relationship between the pregnantwoman and the app interface while searching for herhealth information, the electronic literacy results forpregnant women and mothers were overall andabove average satisfactory according to six questionspresented on the electronic form (Table 1).Rev. Bras. Saúde Mater. Infant., Recife, 19 (4): 751-762 out-dez., 2019755Silva AB et al.The seventh question was presented in a free andopen format, gathering a range of observations andsuggestions for ZMD improvement, whose circularcontent analysis was planned by using GTD27combined with the registered WhatsApp chats of thepregnant women that participated. After re-readingand combining, supported by Atlas.ti software, threecategories emerged from open, axial and selectivecodification:• Questions and opinions about the use of theapp;• Interactions among women, services and app;• Organic modifications and pregnancy compli-cations.The synthesis-images demonstrate the code clus-ters that were laid out on a tree with their respectivecitations and co-occurring codes from bottom to top.The pregnant women who browsed the app ontheir smartphones pointed out programming errorsand the absence of some tools that other apps offered(Figure 1). One noteworthy question was put by apregnant woman who made a content observationrelated to the Brazilian cesarean epidemic.28“Some information that I found on the app […] does notproperly encourage normal childbirth and its demystifica-tion.” (M1:3)The code clusters addressing among services,women and app interaction covered topics onservices for pregnant women about prenatal consul-tation, suggestions for sharing information aboutZMD and activities inside the app for the pregnantwoman, as well as encouraging meetings among thepregnant women (Figure 2).The highest number of considerationsconcerning the app hypermedia was the “conversa-tion” with the user, where they give opinions aboutpossible improvements for the app from the expan-sion of the operational system up to service aggrega-tion. Many of them felt the absence of audiovisualresources in relation to their doubts about pregnancyand baby care.It was possible to deduce through a WhatsAppchat one fetal death occurrence (Figure 3) and thatan asynchronous chat from a cell phone app cancomfort and clarify doubts in some determine situa-tions.DiscussionTheoretical-conceptual aspects of e-pregnant womanemergencies in health services may be seen in theresults. The e-patient, in the words of the precursorof the idea,29 is much more than someone whoresearches about her own health on the internet. It issomeone who is equipped, able, qualified andengaged with her wellbeing and her care decisions.The question with the major implication on healthservices has been the third element among thishealth team and patient relationship – the myriad ofinformation on the digital ecosystem.30 It is possibleto perceive from the form responses that there is agap in instructive audiovisual information for preg-nant women. Another pertinent consideration is thatwhile pregnant women consider finding content inthe app easy, in their opinion, it has a complemen-tary character for clarifying doubts about pregnancy.In this sense, it is necessary to prepare theprenatal team to make qualified information avai-lable for pregnant women, whether on their smart-phone or another device. The participatory medicinemovement foresees a transformation in acquisitionof knowledge, clinical team skills and attitudesrelated to the patient. Debronkart11 suggest a newparticipatory medicine model, where these “e-patients” change from mere passengers to drivers incharge of their family health, sharing part of theresponsibility to maintain their wellbeing and findcures. In the case of maternity, this approach has adouble function, the maintenance of the mother’shealth and of her future baby.The interdisciplinary team of health profes-sionals involved in prenatal care must develop theskills to build a data bank of pregnancy sites,including discussion groups and patient communi-ties, in order to reduce the dissemination and influ-ence of low quality or commercially motivated sites.The communication channel between prenatalservices and the pregnant woman must be extendedto explanations of research method, evidence levelsand complex health concepts as well as how toadvise patients on searching for information in certi-fied places, translating the clinical jargon to thelanguage of the future mothers and inspire them toget involved in decision taking about their health andtheir baby’s.31Two limitations of this investigation must bepointed out, considering that the ZMD app assumesa normal pregnancy: 1) the fact that the interviewedmothers had been at a high complexity service,specialized in twin childbirth, infecto-contagiousdiseases, hypertension pregnancies, hemolyticdiseases and congenital malformation in general; 2)the service, although a National Institute, is locatedin an upmarket neighborhood in a State capital , andfor this reason has more patients from the host city.This may influence the high schooling level of the756Rev.

In this study a question remainsif different results would be obtained from womenwith different schooling levels.The ZMD app bets on the mother-baby binomialand continues an interaction with the woman throughmonthly baby follow-up from birth to one year,discussing issues beyond the clinic such as familyplanning. In the first year of life, the child must befrequently followed up, totalling seven consultationsat this stage. However, from the second monthonwards the consultation intervals progressivelyincreases. The official recommendation in Brazil is aconsultation in the first fifteen days of life, followedby the first, second, fourth, sixth, ninth and twelfthmonths of life. The constant evaluations of weightgain or height is vital to a child growth’s analysis,and allows early identification of malnutrition risks.Another important monitoring parameter is thecephalic perimeter,32 but one or another aremeasured on programmed consultations and regis-tered in the Child’s Health Handbook. The family’s participation especially of themother, on the growth evolution and development ofthe child is a differential in each stage of the process.In this research data it was observed that 76% of theparticipants considering that the ZMD app informa-tion is effective on decision making about the baby’s760Rev. Bras. Saúde Mater. Infant., Recife, 19 (4): 751-762 out-dez., 2019Cross cultural adaptation of Zero Mothers Die app in Brazilhealth.As for women's health, it would be interesting tochange the format for relating the gestational weekon information in the ZMD, because the way it ispresented can confuse the layperson. One exampleis regarding information presented about childbirthin the 36th week. It is a fact that childbirth mayhappen at any moment after 22 weeks. However, theapp format could separate women's organic changesand complaints to the detriment of the childbirthevent.In fact, in the 36th week the belly is heavy andthere is vaginal secretion. On the 37th week it is hardto move, on the 38th week it gets hard to breathe. Theapp demonstrates how to clamp a cord in an emer-gency childbirth but does not fully explore the dailyquestions that would relieve some pregnancy doubts.Thus, the group observation was that two sepa-rate modules or even different apps, one for the e-patient and another for the primary care professionalshould be taken in consideration.Inserting an app with information based on thebest prenatal routine evidence from health units withteaching activities generates two immediate opportu-nities: 1) the possibility of updating preceptors, resi-dents and researchers; 2) another channel of dialogueReferences1.
