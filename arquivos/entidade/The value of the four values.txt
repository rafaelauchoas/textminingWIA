Introdulction In [8,9] Belnap introduced a logic intended to deal in a useful way with inconsistent (no knowledge), lack of information the classical ones, information. This logic is based on a structure called FOUR, which has t and f, and two new ones: and T that indicates and incomplete that intuitively four truth values: (“over”- denotes should knowledge). Belnap gave quite convincing think” should be based on these four values. In [26,27] Ginsberg proposed algebraic structures called bilattices that naturally generalize Belnap’s FOUR. The idea is to consider in two closely an arbitrary number of truth values, and to arrange related partial orders, each forming for introducing bilattices was to provide a uniform approach arguments why “the way a computer a lattice.

Avron /Artificial Intelligence IO2 (1998) 97-141 in AI. Bilattices were further investigated by Fitting, who showed that they are useful also for providing semantics for logic programs [ 17,19-211. In [2,3] we presented bilattice- based logics and corresponding proof systems. These logics turned out to have many desirable properties (like paraconsistency). In the present paper we proceed with this logical approach. In particular, we consider bilattice-based logics that are preferential in the sense of Shoham [42,43], i.e., they are based on the idea that inferences should be taken not according to all models of a given theory, but only with respect to a subset of them, determined making such preferences among bilattice-based models: according to certain preference criteria. We use here two main guidelines for (1) Prefer models that assume as much consistency as possible. This approach reflects the intuition that contradictory data corresponds to inadequate information about the real world, and therefore should be minimized. (2) Prefer models that assume a minimal amount of knowledge; The idea this time is that we should not assume anything FOUR, the structure that corresponds that is not really known. four-valued to Belnap’s logic, is the minimal bilattice, exactly as the structure that is based on the classical two values is the minimal Boolean algebra. The main goal of this paper is to show that the logical among bilattices role of FOUR algebra has among Boolean to that the two-valued is also very similar algebras. introduced Indeed, it turned out that all the natural bilattice-valued that we had for various purposes can be characterized using only the four basic values! logics This does not mean, of course, that from now on bilattices have no value (exactly as the fact, that Boolean algebras can be characterized algebras have no value). It does demonstrate, however, in {t, f}, does not mean the fundamental that Boolean role of the four values. In an opposite direction to that taken by Ginsberg and Fitting, other authors tried to get along by using just three values for achieving the same (or similar) goals. We show, however, that the use of four values is preferable to the use of three even for tasks that can in principle be handled using only three values. Taken together, the main import of our results is a strong vindication (so we believe) of Belnap’s goal of computerized reasoning. thesis concerning the fundamental importance of the four basic values for the The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce a propositional language with four-valued semantics. Our language is based on the basic bilattice operators together with an appropriate implication connective. In Section 3 we show the adequacy of this language by exploring its expressive power as well as those of its fragments. Section 4 is devoted to introducing the most important consequence relations that are based on FOUR, and to an examination of their main properties. In Section 5 we compare four- valued formalisms with three-valued ones, and in Section 6 we generalize the four-valued logics of Section 4 to arbitrary bilattices. The main result of this section is that by doing so we do not get any new logic. Finally, in Section 7 we summarize the main results and conclusions of this work. 0. Arieli, A.

The algebraic structure and its basic connectives logic mentioned The truth values of Belnap’s logical partial order, &, which intuitively above have two natural orderings: First in the reflects differences to this order, f is the minimal t is the maximal one, and I, T are two intermediate values that are incomparable. lattice with an order reversing we have the standard “measure of truth” that every value represents. According element, ((t, f, T, A-}, &) -T = T and -I respectively. is a distributive involution 1, for which = 1. We shall denote the meet and the join of this lattice by A and v, (again, intuitively) that each or information The other partial order, <k, is understood the amount of knowledge as reflecting differences in truth value exhibits. Again, ((t, f, T, A_}, <k) is a lattice where _L is its minimal element, T-the maximal element, and t, f are incomparable. Following Fitting [ 17,181 we shall denote the meet and the join of the <k-lattice by @ and @, respectively. The twcl lattice orderings are closely related. The knowledge operators @ and @ are monotone with respect to the truth ordering &, and the truth operators A, v, and 1 (as well, of course, as @ and CT+) are monotone with respect to <k. Moreover, all the 12 laws hold, as well as De Morgan’s laws. The structure that consists of these four distributive elements and the five basic operators (A, v, l,C3, @) is usually called FOUR. A double Hasse diagram of FOUR is given in Fig. 1. 2.2. Designated elements and models The next step in using FOUR for reasoning The obvious choice is 2, = (t , T], since both values intuitively to be true.

The most important result of this section is the following: Theorem 12. The language L* = (1, A, >, I, T) is jknctionally (i.e., every function from FOURn to FOUR is representable by some formula complete in L*). for FOUR Proof. Let g : FOUR” + FOUR. Since FOUR” is characterizable and g- ’ ({I]), f = -(I in L*. Let, accordingly, respectively.

There are, however, other dependencies. The following identities are particularly important: 3 in (1) T = (a > a) ~3 -(a > a), (2) a @ b = (a A T) v (b A T) v (a A b), (3) I=f@-f, (4) f = -(J- 1 U, (5) u @ b = (a A 1) V (b A 1) V (a A b). to the basic cZussicuE language L = {-, A, V, 1) These identities mean that relative connectives T and @ are interdefinable, while I combination functionally t, f}) by adding to it the lattice operators of <k (8 and CD). of @ and f.

In order to represent Kleene’s logics (weak-Kleene4 [21] introduces a new connective, is denoted p : q, and is evaluated as follows: called the guard connective. This connective if p is assigned a designated value (t or T) the value of p : q has the value of q, otherwise p : q has thle value 1. The guard connective has the following simple and natural definition in our language: 6 the connectives of the other Kleene’s and sequential-Kleene5), to the conjunction Fitting p : 9 = (P 14) 63 ‘(P >‘4). We turn IIOW to investigate the expressive power of the various fragments of our language language L = (-, A, V, x}. From the discussion that there are at most eight such fragments, corresponding which include at least the basic classical before Exa:mple 13 it follows to extending L with some subset of (say) [@CL @, f}. Our next theorem provides exact that they characterizations are all different these eight fragments and the various possible combinations from each other. We show that there is a correspondence of the expressive power of each of these fragments, between three conditions: of the following implying (I) g(i’) = T. i < n xi = T.

Taking advantage of the other partial order approach A natural for reducing the set of models which are used for drawing is to consider only the k-minimal models. The idea behind this approach is that conclusions we should not assume anything that is not really known. Keeping the amount of knowledge as minimal as possible may also be captured, at least in (FOUR), as a kind of consistency preserving method: As long as one keeps the redundant as minimal as possible the tendency of getting into conflicts decreases. information Definition 27.

Define for every atom p a valuation M’ as follows: M’(p) = t if N(p) = I and M’(p) = N(p) otherwise. Since the language is k-monotonic and M’ >k N, M’ E mod(r). Now, language Z(M’,Z2) =Z(M’,Z,) = Z(N,Zl) c Z(M,Z]). Moreover, by Proposition 62, Z(M,Zl) = Z(M,Zz), M’ >z2 M-a contradiction. thus Z(M’,Z2) c Z(M,Zz), and so (b) Obviously, it suffices to show the claim for a disjunction contain an atomic formula and its negation.

Consider the valuation Ml, defined as follows: M’(P) = ; M(p) ( if M(p) = I and p @ L(y?), if M(p) = I and p E L(e), otherwise.

The three-valued logics in the context of FOUR Three-valued logics might be roughly divided into two families according to the decision whether the middle element is taken to be designated or not. Logics of the first class are, in fact, logics that are based on the subset (t, f, I) of FOUR, while logics of the other class are based on the subset {t , f, T}. In both cases the languages of the corresponding standard logics are based on some fragment of the language of {-, v, A, G9, @, >, t, f, T, I) (see [6]).

Comparison with four-valued systems The main advantage of using FOUR rather than three-valued systems is, of course, that in one system. This makes it allows us to deal with both types of abnormal propositions t,o construct a system like +gl, which is quite strong on one hand, but allows it possible also the use of constructive as well as relevant paradigms of reasonings on the other hand. In this section we show, moreover, that one can in any case do with FOUR everything one can do using only three values, sometimes even more efficiently. We start by showing 126 0. An’&, A.

More than four values are usually not necessary (FOUR). We In this section we consider a class of structures to achieve logics to those structures the above four-valued inference mechanisms.

I. Bilattices 6.1.1. Background and motivation Bilattices [26,27] are algebraic structures that naturally generalize Belnap’s four-valued lattice, FOUR. The idea is to consider arbitrary number of truth values, and to arrange them (as in FOUR) in two closely related partial orders, each forming a lattice. As in the four-valued case, one intuitively understands one of the orderings as representing degrees of truth, and the other as representing degrees of knowledge. truth maintenance systems and formalisms The original motivation of Ginsberg in AI. In particular he treated first-order for using bilattices was to provide a uniform theories for default reasoning. approach for a diversity of applications and their consequences, The algebraic structure of bilattices has been further investigated by Fitting and Avron [7, 18,211. Fitting has also shown that bilattices are very useful tools for providing semantic for logic programs: He proposed an extension of Smullyan’s to programs, and showed that this method is sound and complete with respect bilattice-valued (see [ 17,191). Fitting to a natural generalization also introduced a multi-valued the Gelfond-Lifschitz for semantics operator [25]) for providing bilattice-based logic programs that is based on (see [20]). A well-founded the bilattice NINE (Fig. 6) is considered also in [ 1 I]. Bilattices have also been found useful for nonmonotonic [27], and reasoning with inconsistent knowledge bases [5,41]. stable models and well-founded semantics of van Emden and Kowalski’s operator fixedpoint operator (that generalizes [22], model-based diagnostics [3,4], temporal reasoning for logic programs proof method tableaux-style reasoning ** The observation that &, and +i 1 are incomparable follows from the facts that excluded middle is valid with respect to +&, but not with respect to +s,, while the disjunctive syllogism (applied to atomic formulae) is valid in +i, but not in &. 0.

Suppose that M is a k-minimal model of I’ in (B, 3), and let h : f3 + FOUR be the homomorphism defmed in Defmition 86. Then h o M is a k-minimal model of r in (FOUR). Proof. Suppose not. Then there is another model N of r, which is k-smaller in (FOUR). By Theorem 83, N is also a model of r than h o M in (B, 3). Define a valuation N’ by 134 0. Arieli, A. Avron /Art$cial Intelligence IO2 (1998) 97-141 N’(p) = infk IN(~) (p atomic). By Corollary 82, N’ is also a model of r in (D, 3). Note that N and N’ are of the same type, and so are M and h o M. Let p be an atomic formula. Case A: If N(p) and (h o M)(p) are of the same type, then so are N’(p) and M(p). By the construction of N’, N’(p) <k M(p). Case B: If N(p) and (h o M)(p) are not of the same then since N(p) <k there are three possible cases: (i) N(p) = I and (h o M)(p) E {t, f, T}, or (h o M)(p), (ii) N(p) = t and (h o M)(p) = T, or (iii) N(p) = f, and (h o M)(p) = T. Let’s consider each case: type, Case B(i): In this case N’(p) = -L as well, while M(p) $ 71, thus M(p) # I and so N’(P) <k M(P). Case B(ii): Since, by Lemma 90-B, N’(p) = Inink3 and M(p) E 3, so N’(p) <k 6 3. Therefore N’(p) <k M(p). But N’(p) # M(p) since -M(p) E 3 while -N’(p) M(P). Case B(iii): Again, by Lemma 90-B, in this case N’(p) = mink -3. But -M(p) E 3, so N’(p) <k M(p) here as well. Now, since N is a model of r in (FOUR), which is strictly k-smaller than h o M, there is at least one atom po that falls under case B above. For this po, N’(po) <k M(po) while for any other atom p, N’(p) <k M(p). Hence N’ is a model of r in (B, 3) which is k-smaller than M-a contradiction. q that r FF’ (B, 3), The “if” direction of Theorem 90 now easily follows from Lemma 90-C: Suppose A. Let M be a k-minimal model of r (h o M)(6) 6 {t, T} for every 6 E A, and so r that r F,” A. Then s.t. for every 6 E A. By Lemma 90-C h o M is a k-minimal model of r in (FOUR) for some logical bilattice M(6) $3 of the same type as M. Therefore there is a k-minimal model M of The other direction: Suppose r in (FOUR) s.t. M(6) 4 {t, T} for every 6 E A. Define a valuation M’ on B as follows: M’(p) = infk 7~~~1 (p atomic). By Corollary 82 and Lemma 90-B, h o M’ = M. Hence (by Proposition 87) M’ is a model of r, and M’(6) $3 for every S E A. Moreover, M’ is a k- minimal model of r, and so r kfVF A. Indeed, if N is another model of r s.t. N <k M’, then h o N <k h o M’ = M. Also, there is p s.t. N(p) <k M’(p) and so N(p) # ‘&Q). Hence h(N(p)) # M(p), and so actually h o N <k M. Since h o N is a model of r in (FOUR) (because N is a model of r), M is not k-minimal-a contradiction. i&i A. q 6.2.2.
